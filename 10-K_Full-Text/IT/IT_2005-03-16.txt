GARTNER, INC.

2004 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K




PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Gartner, Inc., founded in 1979, is a leading independent provider of research and analysis on
information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology
industries (the “IT industry”). We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to
approximately 10,000 client organizations. We serve a global client base consisting primarily of
chief information officers (“CIOs”) and other senior IT and business executives in corporations and
government agencies. We also serve technology companies and the investment community.

The foundation for all Gartner products is our independent research on IT issues. The findings
from this research can be delivered through several different media, depending on a client’s
specific business needs, preferences and objectives:

•

Research

– provides research content and advice for IT professionals, technology companies and the investment
community in the form of reports and briefings, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed
specifically for CIOs and other senior executives.

•

Consulting

– consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day
analyst engagements) (“SAS”), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT
industry.

•

Events

– consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry.

MARKET OVERVIEW

In today’s dynamic IT marketplace, vendors continually introduce new products with a wide variety
of standards and shorter life cycles. The users of technology – almost all organizations – must
keep abreast of these new developments, and make major financial commitments to new IT systems and
products. To plan and purchase effectively, these users of technology need independent, objective,
third-party research and consultative services. We believe that technology accounts for a
significant portion of all capital spending. The intense scrutiny on technology spending ensures
that our products and services remain necessary in the current economy because clients still need
value-added, independent and objective research and analysis of the IT market.

We are a leading provider of independent and objective research and analysis of the IT industry,
and a source of insight about technology acquisition and deployment. Our global research community
provides provocative thought leadership. We employ more research analysts than any competitor. Our
experienced consultants combine our objective, independent research, with a practical, sought-after
business perspective focused on the IT industry. Our events are among the world’s largest of their
kind; gathering highly qualified audiences of senior business executives, IT professionals,
purchasers and vendors of IT products and services.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Our principal products and services are Research, Consulting, and Events:

§

RESEARCH.

Research on IT issues on a global scale is the fundamental building block for
all Gartner services. Our research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the
critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. Research content,
presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered
directly to the client’s desktop. Our research analysts provide in-depth analysis on all
aspects of technology and telecommunications including: hardware, software and systems,
services, IT management, market data and forecasts, and vertical industry issues.

Executive Programs (EXP) are exclusive membership programs designed to help CIOs and other
executives become more effective in their enterprises. An EXP membership leverages the knowledge
and expertise of Gartner in ways that are specific to the CIOs needs, and offers members-only
communities for peer-based collaboration. Members also receive advice and counsel from a personal
relationship manager who understands their goals and can ensure the most effective level of support
from Gartner. Our Best Practices Programs bring together senior business and IT leaders for
exclusive events, multi-client research studies and ad hoc peer exchange forums. These programs
allow clients to learn from the experiences of their peers and share best practices in order to
solve common business problems, improve corporate performance and drive greater effectiveness. At
December 31, 2004, our various Executive Programs had a membership of approximately 2,700 CIOs and
other senior IT leaders.

§

CONSULTING.

Our consulting staff provides customized project consulting on the delivery,
deployment, and management of high-tech products and services in four focus areas: IT
Management and Measurement, Sourcing, Federal Government, and Market and Business Strategies:

IT Management and Measurement. Successful IT organizations must operate with maximum
effectiveness and efficiency while



delivering services that address the business and process issues of their enterprise. Our
consultants provide advice and support that leverages the intelligence of our research to
address and solve the top issues of the IT organization.

Sourcing. Virtually every major enterprise today is considering the issue of IT outsourcing,
offshore resources and business process outsourcing. Our consultants provide advice and project
management support across the four stages of the sourcing process: strategy, evaluation and
selection of partners, contract development, and relationship management.

Federal Government. We are highly experienced in developing IT solutions that meet the unique
challenges faced by federal agencies as they attempt to serve the public’s needs. Budgeting,
procurement and re-engineering are just some of the issues our consultants have addressed in the
public sector arena.

Market and Business Strategies. The intelligence we gather through market research, client
interaction and analysis is unique in the marketplace. Our consultants leverage this
intelligence to assist technology companies in identifying market demand, improving products and
defining the competitive landscape.

•

EVENTS.

Symposia and conferences give clients live access to insights developed from our
research in a concentrated way. In 2004, Gartner events attracted nearly 31,000 participants.
Gartner Symposium, offered each spring and fall in various international locations, is a
large, strategic conference for senior IT and business professionals. Symposium is combined
with ITxpo, an exhibition where the latest technology products and solutions are demonstrated.
We also offer conferences on specialized topics such as: outsourcing, mobile wireless,
customer relationship management, and application integration and business intelligence in
many locations around the world.

Note 15 – Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-K
includes financial information about our geographic areas and our three business segments:
research, consulting and events.

COMPETITION

We believe that the principal competitive factors that differentiate us from our competitors are:

•

The high quality, independence and objectivity of our research and analysis;

•

Our multi-faceted expertise across the IT industry and its technologies, both legacy and emerging;

•

Our position as a research company with broad consulting capabilities;

•

Our position as a consulting firm with research analysts;

•

The timely delivery of information;

•

The ability to offer products that meet changing market needs at competitive prices; and

•

Our superior customer service.

We face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and
services. We compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers, including
electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly
with us in the future. Additionally, we face competition from our clients receiving information
from free sources through the Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we
do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide
additional or complementary services. However, we believe the breadth and depth of our research
assets position us well versus our competition. Increased competition may result in us losing
market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased sales
and marketing expenditures.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge
capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent,
trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect
our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality and ownership and to
the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property, and we also enter into agreements with
our employees as appropriate.

We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify,
create and protect it.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2004, we had 3,625 employees, of which 661 were located at our headquarters in
Stamford, Connecticut; 1,649 were located at our other facilities in the United States; and 1,315
were located outside of the United States. Our employees may be subject to



collective bargaining agreements at a company or industry level in those countries where this is
part of the local labor law or practice. We have experienced no work stoppages and consider our
relations with our employees to be favorable. In December 2004, we announced a restructuring plan
that included a severance charge of $5.9 million as part of a workforce reduction as we continue to
align our business resources with revenue expectations. Pursuant to that plan, during the fourth
quarter of Calendar 2004, we reduced our workforce by 40 employees, or approximately 1% of our total workforce as of
December 31, 2004. We expect additional reductions to occur during the first quarter of Calendar
2005, which will result in an additional severance charge estimated at between $5.0 to $6.0
million.

information is also available in print to any shareholder who requests it by writing to Investor

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Our corporate headquarters is located in approximately 213,000 square feet of leased office space
in three buildings located in Stamford, Connecticut, USA. These facilities accommodate research and
analysis, marketing, sales, client support, production and corporate administration. The leases on
these facilities expire in 2010. We have a significant presence in the United Kingdom with
approximately 72,000 square feet of leased office space in two buildings located in Egham, UK, for
which the leases expire in 2020 and 2025, respectively. We have an additional 36 domestic and 50
international locations that support our research and analysis, domestic and international sales
efforts and other functions. As part of our continuing effort to adjust our office space as needs
change, we announced plans to reduce our office space in San Jose, California by consolidating
employees from two buildings into one building in the second or third quarter of Calendar 2005,
which we estimate will result in a charge from $6.0 to $7.0 million. We believe that our existing
facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional space will be available as
needed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
believe the outcome of all current proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material
effect on our financial position or results of operations when resolved in a future period.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

We did not submit any matter to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of the year
covered by this Annual Report.



PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES.

As of February 28, 2005, there were approximately 200 holders of record of our Class A Common Stock
and approximately 3,029 holders of record of our Class B Common Stock. Our Class A and Class B
Common Stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols IT and ITB, respectively. The
Class B Common Stock is identical in all respects to the Class A Common Stock, except that the
Class B Common Stock is entitled to elect at least 80% of the members of our Board of Directors.

In February 2005, we announced that the Board of Directors approved the combination of our Class A
and Class B Common Stock. The combination is subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting
to take place in the late spring or early summer of 2005.

The following table sets forth the high and low closing prices for our Class A Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the periods indicated.

2004. However, see “Executive Summary of Operations and Financial Position” in Item 7 for a
discussion of shares repurchased during the first three-quarters of Calendar 2004.

The equity compensation plan information set forth in Part III, Item 12 of this Form 10-K is hereby
incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 5.

DIVIDEND POLICY

We currently do not pay cash dividends on our Class A or Class B Common Stock. While subject to
periodic review, the current policy of our Board of Directors is to retain all earnings primarily
to provide funds for continued growth. Our Credit Agreement, dated August 12, 2004, contains a
negative covenant, which may limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, our Amended and
Restated Security Holders Agreement with Silver Lake Partners, L.P. requires us to obtain Silver
Lake’s consent prior to declaring or paying dividends.

The following items impact the comparability of our data from continuing operations:

•

During the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we completed a tender
offer in which we repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares of
our Class A common stock and 5.5 million shares of our Class B
common stock. Additionally, we also repurchased approximately
9.2 million Class A
shares from Silver Lake Partners and certain of its affiliates. We
borrowed $200.0 million in connection with these purchases. During
Calendar 2003, our long-term debt was converted into equity.

facilities, impairment of long-lived assets and exit from certain
non-core product lines, on a pre-tax basis, of $35.8 million for
Calendar 2004, $29.7 million for Calendar 2003, $49.4 million for
Calendar 2002, $32.2 million for Transition 2002, $17.2 million
for Fiscal 2002, $46.6 million for Fiscal 2001, and $0 for Fiscal

claims, on a pre-tax basis, of $5.5 million for Calendar 2003,
$0.5



million for Calendar 2002, $1.3 million for Fiscal 2002, $(0.6) million for Fiscal 2001, and
$29.6 million for Fiscal 2000.

•

A tax benefit of $14.5 million for Fiscal 2001 due to the utilization of foreign tax credits.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, this Annual Report contains forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, including
statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the
future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as
“may,” “will,” “expect,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” ‘plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “predict,”
“potential,” “continue,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are subject
to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a
difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Factors That May Affect Future
Results” below. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which
reflect management’s opinion only as of the date on which they were made. Except as required by
law, we disclaim any obligation to review or update these forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances as they occur. Readers should review carefully any risk factors described
in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

OVERVIEW

With the convergence of IT and business, technology has become increasingly more important –
not just to technology professionals, but also to business executives. We are an independent and
objective research and advisory firm that helps IT and business executives use technology to build,
guide and grow their enterprises.

We employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research
intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market-leading position and brand
franchise. Our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that
intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging, campaigning and
cross-selling of our products and services. Our diversified business model provides multiple entry
points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting and
events. A key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying
relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering
strategically relevant research and analysis.

We intend to maintain a balance between (1) pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a
strict focus on growing our three core businesses and (2) generating profitability through a
streamlined cost structure.

We have three business segments: research, consulting and events.

•

Research

provides research content and advice for IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community
in the form of reports and briefings, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically
for CIOs and other senior executives.

•

Consulting

consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day
analyst engagements) (“SAS”), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT
industry.

•

Events

consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry.

We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our
business segments:

Business Segment

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

Research

Contract value

represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related
research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated
as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific
point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract.

Client retention rate

represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business
relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage
basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients
from a year ago.



Business Segment

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

Wallet retention rate

represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have
retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a
percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year
earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds
client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or
increased spending by retained clients, or both.

Number of executive program members

represents the number of paid participants in
executive programs.

Consulting

Consulting backlog

represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting,
measurement and strategic advisory services engagements.

Utilization rates

ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF META GROUP, INC.

On December 27, 2004, we announced an agreement to acquire META Group, Inc. (“META”) in an all-cash
transaction for $10.00 per share, or approximately $162 million, excluding transaction costs. META
is a publicly owned, premier information technology and research firm based in Stamford,
Connecticut with 715 employees. In 2004, META generated $141.5 million in revenue from 52 worldwide
locations and had $90.8 million of assets at December 31, 2004. META trades on the NASDAQ National
Market under the symbol “METG.” The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the
transaction, and on January 31, 2005, we announced that notice had been received from the Federal
Trade Commission of early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act. META filed its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on February 17, 2005 and
is scheduled to hold a special meeting of stockholders to approve the transaction on March 23,
2005. Closing of the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including
approval by META’s stockholders, is expected to be effective
April 1, 2005.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

During Calendar 2004, we have continued to focus on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our
core Research business. This continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter
half of Calendar 2003. We ended the latter half of Calendar 2003 with two consecutive quarters of
sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing
contract value. Contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of Calendar 2004,
decreased slightly during the second quarter of Calendar 2004, and increased sequentially again in
both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, contract value was
$509.2 million, up 6% from the $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, with roughly half of the
increase due to the effects of foreign currency. The $509.2 million contract value represents our
highest contract value since the first quarter of Calendar 2002. Our Research client retention rate
at December 31, 2004 increased to 80% from 78% at the prior year-end, while wallet retention
increased to 95% from 89% over the same period.

Consulting revenue for Calendar 2004 was flat when compared to Calendar 2003, despite the impact of
the realignment in which we reduced headcount when we exited certain practices and geographies.
Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues would have decreased
approximately 4% in Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Our Consulting business ended Calendar
2004 with the continuation of the positive trend that began in Calendar 2003, when we ended that
year with two consecutive quarters of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive
quarters of sequential decreases. Due to the realignment, consulting backlog decreased to $91.7
million at March 31, 2004, but quickly increased to $97.7 million at June 30, 2004 and $103.4
million at September 30, 2004, as business ramped up in our areas of focus. We ended the year with
a backlog of $111.8 million, a $12.1 million increase over December 31, 2003. The realignment has
also had a positive impact on sub-optimal utilization rates and our lack of scale in some regions.
During Calendar 2004, our average consultant utilization rates increased to approximately 63% as
compared to 54% in the prior year, while billable headcount declined to 493 at December 31, 2004,
compared to 526 at December 31, 2003.

Our Events business continues to deliver strong results. Our emphasis on managing the Events
portfolio to retain our long-time successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted
in substantially improved overall revenue performance, with Calendar 2004 revenue up 16% over the
prior year, as well as same event revenue, up 19% over the prior year. We achieved these results
while the number of events declined, with 56 held during Calendar 2004 as compared to 57 held
in Calendar 2003.



During Calendar 2004, we repurchased a significant number of shares of our Class A and Class B
Common Stock. During the first half of Calendar 2004, we repurchased 413,225 shares of our Class A
Common Stock and 114,600 shares of our Class B Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $6.1 million
under our Stock Repurchase Program. During the third quarter of 2004, we completed a “Dutch Auction
Tender Offer” in which we repurchased 11,339,019 shares of our Class A Common Stock and 5,505,489
shares of our Class B Common Stock at a purchase price of $13.30 and $12.50 per share,
respectively. Additionally, we also repurchased 9,228,938 shares of our Class A Common Stock from
Silver Lake Partners and certain of its affiliates (“Silver Lake”) at a purchase price of $13.30
per share. The total cost of these purchases was $346.2 million, including transaction costs of
$3.8 million. In conjunction with the tender offer, our Board of Directors terminated the Stock
Repurchase Program in June 2004.

In connection with the tender offer, in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we borrowed $200.0
million under a five-year term loan facility, of which $10.0 million was repaid in the fourth
quarter of Calendar 2004. We also obtained a $100.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility,
of which $59.2 million was available at December 31, 2004. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement
covenant requirements which resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit
facility. As a result, the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility would have been
$96.5 million at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004, we had a cash balance of $160.1 million compared to $230.0 million at
December 31, 2003. In order to fund the purchase of META, we anticipate that we will use a
combination of cash and our amended five-year revolving credit facility. In connection with funding
the META transaction, the Company anticipates repatriating $52.0 million in cash earnings from its
non-US subsidiaries in early 2005.

In February 2005, our Board of Directors approved the elimination of our classified Board
structure. Additionally, as previously announced, the Board of Directors has approved the
combination of our Class A and Class B Common Stock. Both of these items are subject to stockholder
approval at our annual meeting of stockholders to take place in the late spring or early summer of
2005.

During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we made a significant change to our capital structure.
Our 6% convertible notes were converted into Class A Common Stock. This eliminated all of our
outstanding debt at that time and the related interest expense.

FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS

Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many
factors, including: the timing of Symposia, our flagship event that normally occurs during the
fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of
domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services;
changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new
products and services; and competition in the industry. The potential fluctuations in our operating
income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could
provide an unreliable indication of future operating results.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting
policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an
understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective
judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.

Revenue recognition

– We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (“SAB 101”), and SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition
(“SAB 104”). Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:



Uncollectible fees receivable

– Provisions for bad debts are recognized as incurred. The
measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is
based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current
economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently
judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated
and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes
available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our
clients’ liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to
pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The
following table provides our total fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses
(in thousands):

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

– The evaluation of goodwill is performed in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, - “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (”SFAS 142”). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill
amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The
evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require
management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business
operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine
that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an
impairment charge, for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit, to earnings in our financial
statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following:

Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the
valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these
valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to
uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. During 2004,
we recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million in the first quarter relating to goodwill
associated with certain operations in South America that were closed, and in the fourth quarter we
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the exit from certain non-core
product lines.

Accounting for income taxes

– As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our
current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets
and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the
availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and
ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation
allowance. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in
the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would
increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we
would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment
to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was
made.

Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals

– We record accruals for severance costs, lease
costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of
actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce
ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease
payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based
on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those
estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due
to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved.
During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we revised our previous estimates for costs and losses
associated with excess facilities due to declines in market rates for expected sublease income and
revised expected periods of sublease. As a result of these revised estimates, we recorded a charge
for excess facilities of $2.3 million, which was included in Other charges along with severance,
impairment, and other costs. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation
costs during each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our
estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes
not known until after year end.



Impairment of investment securities

– A charge to earnings is made when a market decline below cost
is other than temporary. Management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based
on criteria that include: the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less
than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the valuation of
comparable companies and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Future adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an
inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an
investment’s current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.
We own equity securities through two limited partnerships, SI Venture Associates (“SI I”) and SI
Venture Fund II (“SI II”), which are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early
to mid-stage IT-based or Internet-enabled companies. At December 31, 2004, we owned 100% of SI I
and 22% of SI II. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we made the decision to liquidate SI I and
to sell our interest in SI II. In addition, in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a
charge of $1.5 million related to the liquidation of SI I, which included $0.8 million for the
write-down of the investment and $0.7 million in related shutdown charges. No charges were recorded
on SI II in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the planned sale since the carrying
value of the investment approximates its net realizable value. In the third quarter of Calendar
2004, we recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related to the transfer of our investment in
TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in our ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred
basis points. As a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership, we were relieved of all
future capital calls, which had totaled $4.0 million.

Total investments in equity securities were $7.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $10.9 million at
December 31, 2003 (see Note 5 – Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements).

CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR

On October 30, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a change of our fiscal
year-end from September 30 to December 31, effective January 1, 2003. This change resulted in a
three-month transitional period ending December 31, 2002. References to Transition 2002, unless
otherwise indicated, refer to the three-month transitional period ended December 31, 2002.
References to Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, unless otherwise indicated, are to the respective fiscal
year period from October 1 through September 30. References to Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003, and
Calendar 2002, unless otherwise indicated, are to the respective twelve-month period from January 1
through December 31.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CALENDAR 2004 VERSUS CALENDAR 2003

Total revenues increased 4% to $893.8 million during Calendar 2004 from $858.4 million during Calendar 2003.

•

Research

revenues increased 3% in Calendar 2004 to $480.5 million,
compared to $466.9 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately
54% of total revenues in both Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003.

•

Consulting

revenues in Calendar 2004 of $259.4 were up slightly compared
to the $258.6 in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 29% and 30%
of total revenues in Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $138.4 million in Calendar 2004, an increase of 16%
from the $119.4 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately
15% of total revenues in Calendar 2004 versus 14% in Calendar 2003.

•

Other

revenues, consisting principally of software licensing and
maintenance fees, increased 15% to $15.5 million in Calendar 2004 from
$13.6 million in Calendar 2003.

The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 3% positive effect on total
revenues for Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Excluding the positive effects of foreign
currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 1%. See the Segment Results
section below for a further discussion of segment revenues.

Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients
increased 4% to $559.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $535.7 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from
sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) increased 4% to $263.0 million in
Calendar 2004 from $252.3 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from sales to clients in other
international regions increased 1% to $71.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $70.5 million in Calendar
2003.

Cost of services and product development increased 6% during Calendar 2004 to $434.5 million from
$410.7 million during Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, cost
of services and product development would have increased by 2%, primarily due to increased
investment in our core Research business. Growth in our Executive Programs and Events businesses
also contributed to higher costs in Calendar 2004. As a percentage of sales, cost of services and
product development increased to 48.6% from 47.8% in the prior year period. Cost of services and
product development in Calendar 2004 benefited from the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years’
incentive compensation.



Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%, to $349.8 million during Calendar 2004
from $333.4 million during Calendar 2003. SG&A would have increased by approximately 2% excluding
the negative effects of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense
increased slightly in Calendar 2004, to 39.1% of sales from 38.8% in Calendar 2003. SG&A expenses
benefited during Calendar 2004 from the reversal of $3.3 million of prior years’ incentive
compensation, as well as a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.7 million due to
increased collections and a decline in bad debt write-offs as a percentage of sales.

Depreciation expense for Calendar 2004 decreased 23% to $27.7 million, compared to $36.0 million
for Calendar 2003. The decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during Calendar 2004,
Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002 relative to the capital spending during Fiscal 2001 and 2000, which
led to a decrease in depreciation expense.

Amortization of intangibles decreased 46% when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003 due to
certain intangible assets having been fully amortized since the third quarter of Calendar 2003.

Goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in Calendar 2004 compared to $0 in Calendar 2003, reflecting
the write-off of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and other
non-core product lines.

Other charges during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 were $11.9 million, of which $5.9 million
was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of 40 employees. We expect
additional workforce reductions to occur during the first quarter of Calendar 2005 which will
result in an additional severance and benefits charge estimated at between $5.0 million and $6.0
million. Other charges of $4.3 million during the third quarter of Calendar 2004 primarily included
severance costs associated with the departure of our President and our former CEO of $3.1 million
and $0.8 million, respectively. Other charges of $9.1 million during the second quarter of Calendar
2004 included $3.8 million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former CEO, as
well as $5.3 million of costs associated with the termination of 30 employees. During the first
quarter of Calendar 2004, other charges of $10.5 million were primarily associated with a
realignment of our workforce. This workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan
initiated during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 and resulted in the termination of 132
employees, or approximately 4% of our workforce, bringing the total terminations associated with
the action plan to 262 employees. We expect payments associated with
the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by the end of
the second quarter of Calendar 2005. We are funding these costs out of existing cash.

For all of Calendar 2004, we recorded total charges of $29.7 million related to the realignment of
our workforce, including costs of $7.7 million related to the departure of our President and our
former CEO. The realignment resulted in the termination of 203 employees for the full year. The
annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately $23.3 million.
However, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products,
processes, and infrastructure to help drive future growth.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we revised our estimates of previously
recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional
provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases,
as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. We also recorded a charge of $1.9 million
in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the abandonment of certain internal systems, and
$1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non-core
operations. As part of our continuing effort to adjust our office space as needs change, we have
announced plans to reduce our office space in San Jose, California by consolidating employees from
two buildings into one building in the second or third quarter of Calendar 2005, which we estimate
will result in a charge ranging from $6.0 to $7.0 million.

In the first quarter of Calendar 2005, we plan to restructure certain international operations,
which we estimate will result in a charge ranging from $4.0 million to $5.0 million.

Other charges of $29.7 million during Calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and
benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions, $5.4 million
during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 and $14.6 million during the fourth quarter of Calendar
2003. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we revised our estimates of
previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $9.7 million of
additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected
subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The workforce reduction that
occurred during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in

Transition 2002, which resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our
workforce. The purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments. The
workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 resulted in the
termination of 130 employees, or approximately 3% of our workforce. The purpose of this workforce
reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations, strengthen key consulting practices, and
align our organizational structure to focus on client needs.

Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2004 was a loss of $3.0 million. In the fourth
quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million related to the liquidation of SI I.
In addition, we recorded an additional charge of $0.7 million in related liquidation costs, which
is recorded in Other charges. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $2.2
million for the transfer of our investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in our
ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the
decrease in ownership, we were relieved of all future capital calls, which had totaled $4.0
million. See Note 5 –  Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



Gain (loss) on investments, net of $4.7 million during Calendar 2003 includes a $5.5 million
insurance recovery received during Calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising
from the sale of a business. Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2003 also includes an
impairment loss of $0.9 million associated with a minority-owned investment not publicly traded. We
evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack
of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity, which led us to write the
investment down to our estimate of fair value.

The conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of 2003
decreased our interest expense. However, due to the new credit agreement signed in the third
quarter of 2004, interest expense will increase in the future.

Other (expense), net for Calendar 2004 of $3.9 million includes the non-cash write-off of $3.1
million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our
operations in South America that we have closed. As a result of this decision we were required to
reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation.”
Other income, net for Calendar 2003 of $0.5 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange
gains.

Provision for income taxes was 51.0% and 33.4% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2004 and
2003, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2004, as compared to that
of Calendar 2003, reflects the impact of a charge for planned repatriation of foreign earnings in Calendar
2005 at a one-time favorable tax rate pursuant to the Jobs Creation
Act of 2004. It also reflects the impact of certain non-deductible book charges for workforce reductions, excess facilities, asset impairments, and losses on capital investments. These additional charges are partially offset by the release of valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.
Excluding these other charges, the effective tax rate would have been 32.7% in Calendar 2004, as compared to 33% in Calendar 2003.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution
margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, and other
charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.

Research

Research revenues increased 3% when comparing Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, but excluding the
favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue was flat.

Research gross contribution of $292.7 million for Calendar 2004 decreased slightly from the $292.9
million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 decreased to 61% from
63% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in Calendar 2004 was primarily
due to increased revenues from our executive programs, which have lower margins than our core
subscription products, as well as continued investment in our people, products, and processes
required to provide Research growth.

Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $509.2 million at December
31, 2004, an increase of 6% from $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, with roughly half of the
increase due to the effects of foreign currency. The research contract value of $509.2 million at
December 31, 2004 represents our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of
Calendar 2002. During this period, we have been focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in
our core Research business. This continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the
latter half of Calendar 2003. We ended the latter half of 2003 with two consecutive quarters of
sequential increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing
contract value. Contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of Calendar 2004,
decreased slightly during the second quarter of Calendar 2004, and increased sequentially again in
both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2004.

At December 31, 2004, our client retention rates increased 2 percentage points to 80% as compared
to the same measure at December 31, 2003. Wallet retention increased 6 percentage points during
Calendar 2004 to 95%. While wallet retention rates held steady or climbed over the four quarters of
Calendar 2004, client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and then climbed for the
remainder of the year.
Our Executive Program membership was 2,708 at December 31, 2004, up 16% from 2,332 at December 31,
2003, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as improved
renewal rates.

Consulting

Consulting revenues of $259.4 for Calendar 2004 were up slightly when compared to the $258.6
million in Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues would
have decreased approximately 4% in Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Adjusted for currency
effects, Consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of
our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies.



Consulting gross contribution of $92.7 million for Calendar 2004 increased 7% from the $86.8
million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 increased to 36% from
34% in the prior year. The increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to
higher consultant utilization rates, which were approximately 63% during Calendar 2004 as compared
to approximately 54% during Calendar 2003, as the effects of the realignment were realized, and the
reduction in our billable headcount to 493 at December 31, 2004 as compared to 526 at December 31,
2003, a 6% decrease. Our billable rate was $327.00 per hour in Calendar 2004, a 7% increase from
the $306.00 rate in Calendar 2003, which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a
higher billable rate in EMEA due to the effects of foreign exchange.

Consulting backlog increased 12% to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $99.7 million
at December 31, 2003. Our Consulting business ended Calendar 2004 with the continuation of the
positive trend that began in Calendar 2003, when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters
of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases. Due to
the realignment in which we exited certain practices and geographies, consulting backlog decreased
to $91.7 million at March 31, 2004, but increased to $97.7 million at June 30, 2004 and $103.4
million at September 30, 2004, as business ramped up in our areas of focus.

Events

Events revenues increased 16% to $138.4 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $119.4 million for
Calendar 2003. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 2% favorable impact
on revenues when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003. Revenues have increased despite having
one less event during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003, with 56 and 57 events,
respectively. Revenue for Calendar 2004 increased due to higher attendance and higher average
exhibitor revenue, resulting in higher average revenue per event in our recurring events.
Attendance at Events increased to 30,999 in Calendar 2004 from 27,547 in Calendar 2003, a 12.5%
increase, which is attributed to the popularity of the topics offerred.

Gross contribution of $69.5 million for Calendar 2004 was 24% higher than the $56.0 million
recorded in Calendar 2003. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution increased to 50% during
Calendar 2004 from 47% during Calendar 2003. The increase in gross contribution margin was due to
the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs. Also, during 2003, we invested
more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak economy,
especially in the technology sector.

CALENDAR 2003 VERSUS CALENDAR 2002

Total revenues decreased 3% to $858.4 million during Calendar 2003 from $887.6 million during Calendar 2002.

•

Research

revenues decreased 4% in Calendar 2003 to $466.9 million,
compared to $487.0 million in Calendar 2002, and comprised approximately
54% and 55% of total revenues in Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002,
respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues decreased 6% to $258.6 million in Calendar 2003,
compared to $276.1 million in Calendar 2002, and comprised approximately

respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $119.4 million in Calendar 2003, an increase of 9%
from the $109.7 million in Calendar 2002, and comprised approximately
14% of total revenues in Calendar 2003 versus 12% in Calendar 2002.

•

Other

revenues, consisting principally of software licensing and
maintenance fees, decreased 9% to $13.6 million in Calendar 2003 from
$14.9 million in Calendar 2002.

While revenues declined in the United States and Canada region, they increased in our EMEA and the
Other International regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients decreased 7%
to $535.7 million in Calendar 2003 from $576.5 million in Calendar 2002. Revenues from sales to
clients in the EMEA region increased 5% to $252.3 million in Calendar 2003 from $241.3 million in
Calendar 2002. Revenues from sales to clients in Other International regions increased 1% to $70.5
million in Calendar 2003 from $69.8 million in Calendar 2002.

The decrease in our total revenues was a result of a decline in demand throughout the entire
technology sector and the overall weakness in the economy, partially offset by the positive effects
of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, revenues
would have decreased approximately 8%. See Segment Analysis section below for a further discussion
of segment revenues.

Cost of services and product development increased 4% during Calendar 2003 to $410.7 million from
$396.5 million during Calendar 2002. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, cost
of services and product development would have decreased by 1%. As a percentage of sales, cost of
services and product development increased to 47.8% from 44.7% due primarily to investments in
Gartner EXP, membership programs, product development and costs associated with customer
intelligence, higher conference related expenses and lower utilization rates for our consulting
practice.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4%, to $333.4 million during Calendar 2003
from $346.5 million during Calendar 2002. SG&A would have decreased by approximately 7% had it not
been for the negative effect of foreign currency translation. The



decrease in SG&A was primarily the result of lower sales commissions and our continued focus on
streamlining our support organizations and restructuring efforts.

Depreciation expense for Calendar 2003 decreased 18% to $36.0 million, compared to $43.7 million
for Calendar 2002. The decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during Calendar 2002 and
Calendar 2003 relative to the capital spending during Fiscal 2000 and 2001, which led to a decrease
in depreciation expense. In addition, costs capitalized during Fiscal 2000 associated with the
initial launch of the gartner.com Web site in January 2001 have been fully depreciated as of the
beginning of Calendar 2003.

Amortization of intangibles decreased 34% when comparing Calendar 2003 to Calendar 2002 due to
certain intangible assets having been fully amortized over the past year.

Other charges of $29.7 million during Calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and
benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions, $5.4 million
during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 and $14.6 million during the fourth quarter of Calendar
2003. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we revised our estimates of
previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $9.7 million of
additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected
subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The workforce reduction that
occurred during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in
Transition 2002, which resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our
workforce. The purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments. The
workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 resulted in the
termination of 130 employees, or approximately 3% of our workforce. The purpose of this workforce
reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations, to strengthen key consulting practices,
and to align our organizational structure to focus on client needs.

During Calendar 2002, other charges were $49.4 million. These charges were the result of two
actions, one during the first quarter of Calendar 2002 amounting to $17.2 million, and the other
occurring during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2002, or Transition 2002, amounting to $32.2
million. Of the charges occurring during the first quarter of Calendar 2002, $10.0 million related
to costs and losses associated with the elimination of excess facilities, principally leasehold
improvements and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub-lease arrangements. In
addition, approximately $5.8 million of these charges were associated with our workforce reduction
initiated during the first quarter of Calendar 2002 and were for employee termination severance and
benefits. This workforce reduction resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2%
of our workforce at that time. We expect the payments associated with the workforce reduction to be
completed by the end of the first quarter of 2004. The remaining $1.4 million of expenses recorded
as other charges during the first quarter of Calendar 2002 relates to the impairment of certain
database-related assets. Of the $32.2 million of charges during the fourth quarter of Calendar
2002, $13.3 million related to costs and losses associated with our elimination of excess
facilities, principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with
sub-lease arrangements. The remaining $18.9 million of these charges related to severance payments
and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction, which included $0.6 million of non-cash
compensation. This workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of approximately 175 positions,
or approximately 4% of our workforce at the time.

Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2003 includes a $5.5 million insurance recovery
received during Calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses arising from the sale of a
business. Gain (loss) on investments, net during Calendar 2003 also includes an impairment loss of
$0.9 million associated with a minority-owned investment not publicly traded. We evaluated the
investment for impairment because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack of capital
resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity, which led us to write the investment down to
our estimate of fair value. The loss on investments during Calendar 2002 was caused primarily by
the recognition of impairment losses related to equity securities owned by us through two limited
partnerships, SI Venture Associates (“SI I”) and SI Venture Fund II (“SI II”). SI I and SI II are
venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or
Internet-enabled companies. At December 31, 2002 we owned 100% of SI I and 34% of SI II. See Note 5
– Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the
gains and losses on investments.

Interest expense decreased during Calendar 2003 due to the conversion of our debt to equity in
October 2003. The conversion of our debt has eliminated most of our interest expense since the
conversion date.

Other income, net for Calendar 2003 of $0.5 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange
gains. For Calendar 2002, other income, net of $0.1 million includes a $0.5 million gain from the
sale of certain assets during the first quarter of Calendar 2002, partially offset by net foreign
exchange losses.



Provision for income taxes was 33.4% and 37.7% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2003 and
2002, respectively. Excluding the other charges for workforce reductions, excess facilities and
asset impairments and the gains and losses from investments, the effective tax rate would have been
33% in Calendar 2003 as compared to 34% in Calendar 2002. The reduction in the effective tax rate
for Calendar 2003, as compared to that of Calendar 2002, reflects the implementation of tax
planning strategies.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution
margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, and other
charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.

Research

Research revenues decreased 4% when comparing Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002. Foreign currency
exchange rates favorably impacted research revenues by approximately 4%. The decrease in research
revenues was due to the overall weakness in the economy and the impact of this weakness on
corporate information technology spending causing lower demand throughout the entire technology
sector.

Research gross contribution of $292.9 million for Calendar 2003 decreased 8% from $318.7 million
for Calendar 2002, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2003 decreased to 63% from 65% in
the prior year. The decrease in gross contribution and gross contribution margin is a result of the
lower revenues and costs associated with investments in Gartner EXP, Gartner G2, membership
programs, product development and marketing and costs associated with customer intelligence.

Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $482.2 million at December
31, 2003, a decrease of 1% from $489.0 million at December 31, 2002. However, research contract
value increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2003 from $468.5
million at June 30, 2003 and $469.6 million at September 30, 2003. Prior to these sequential
increases during Calendar 2003, contract value had decreased sequentially for five consecutive
quarters. At December 31, 2003, our client retention rates increased 4 percentage points to 78% as
compared to the same measure at December 31, 2002. Wallet retention increased 8 percentage points
during Calendar 2003 to 89%. The client and wallet retention rates increased steadily over the four
quarters of Calendar 2003.

Consulting

Consulting revenues decreased 6% during Calendar 2003 to $258.6 million from $276.1 million for
Calendar 2002. Foreign currency exchange rates had a positive impact of approximately 5% during
Calendar 2003. The decrease in revenues was caused by lower utilization. Billable headcount for our
Consulting business as of December 31, 2003 increased to 526 at December 31, 2003 as compared to
459 at December 31, 2002.

Consulting gross contribution of $86.8 million for Calendar 2003 decreased 16% from $102.8 million
for Calendar 2002, and gross contribution margin for Calendar 2003 decreased to 34% from 37% in the
prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to lower
consultant utilization rates, which were approximately 53% during Calendar 2003 as compared to
approximately 56% during Calendar 2002.

Consulting backlog decreased 10% to $99.7 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $111.3 million
at December 31, 2002, but increased sequentially during both the third and fourth quarters of
Calendar 2003, when it was $91.0 million at June 30, 2003 and $92.8 million at September 30, 2003.
Consulting backlog decreased as compared to the prior year due to the decline in demand throughout
the entire technology sector, as technology customers continued to constrain spending.

Events

Events revenues increased 9% to $119.4 million for Calendar 2003, compared to $109.7 million for
Calendar 2002. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 5% favorable impact
on revenues when comparing Calendar 2003 to Calendar 2002. Revenues have increased slightly despite
having nine fewer events during Calendar 2003 as compared to Calendar 2002. The average revenue per
event increased during Calendar 2003 due to the strong performance of our recurring events, as well
as the addition of new events during Calendar 2003 that had higher revenues than the events that
were eliminated.

Gross contribution of $56.0 million for Calendar 2003 was relatively consistent with Calendar 2002.
As a percentage of revenues, gross



contribution decreased to 47% during Calendar 2003 from 51% during Calendar 2002. The decrease in
gross contribution margin was due primarily to increased personnel expenses and increased event
marketing costs. During 2003, we invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain
our attendance levels during a weak economy, especially in the technology sector.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Calendar 2004

Cash provided by operating activities during Calendar 2004 totaled $48.3 compared to $136.3 million
in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $88.0 million was due
to several factors. We paid $27.0 million in bonuses during 2004 compared to zero in Calendar 2003.
No bonuses were paid during Calendar 2003 as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended
December 31, 2002 but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our
change in fiscal year that became effective January 1, 2003. As a result, the 2003 bonuses were
paid in Calendar 2004. Further, we paid a portion of our 2004 bonuses in the third quarter of 2004
in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan. Additionally, cash from operating
activities declined because we paid approximately $14.0 million more in severance during Calendar
2004 than in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to
the accelerated collection of receivables in Calendar 2003 which improved operating cash flow in
that year by approximately $26.0 million, which was not repeated in Calendar 2004. Lastly,
approximately $15.0 million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of Calendar
2003 were paid in the first quarter of 2004.

Cash used in investing activities increased to $29.0 million during Calendar 2004 as compared to
$25.4 million for Calendar 2003. The increase was primarily due to $3.9 million we prepaid related
to the acquisition of META. Capital expenditures in Calendar 2004 of $25.1 million were 15% lower
than the $28.9 million in Calendar 2003. During Calendar 2003, we received an insurance recovery of
$5.5 million, and we funded $2.0 million of our capital commitment to SI II.

Cash used by financing activities totaled $97.3 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $3.0 million
used in Calendar 2003. We purchased $352.3 million of our common stock for treasury during Calendar
2004, of which $346.2 million represents the tender offer and Silver Lake repurchases, inclusive of
related costs, as compared to $43.4 million during the prior year. We received proceeds from stock
issued for stock plans of $67.8 million during Calendar 2004, as compared to $41.7 million during
the prior year. This increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as
increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options
to be in the money during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003. We borrowed $200 million
related to the tender in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, receiving proceeds, net of debt
issuance costs, of $197.2 million. We repaid $10 million of this debt in the fourth quarter of
Calendar 2004.

At December 31, 2004, cash and cash equivalents totaled $160.1 million. The effect of exchange
rates increased cash and cash equivalents by $8.1 million during Calendar 2004, and was due to the
weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Sterling.

Calendar 2003

Cash provided by operating activities during Calendar 2003 was $136.3 million, compared to $145.8
million during Calendar 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash-related earnings and a
smaller decrease in receivables during Calendar 2003 compared to Calendar 2002. Cash-related
earnings are income from continuing operations adjusted for the non-cash items included in income,
such as depreciation and amortization, the accretion of interest and amortization of debt issue
costs, along with other non-cash charges. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher bonus
payments during Calendar 2002. Bonus payments were higher during Calendar 2002 due to our change in
fiscal year from September 30 to December 31, effective January 1, 2003. Our Fiscal 2002 bonuses
were paid during Transition 2002, or the fourth quarter of Calendar 2002, whereas, Calendar 2003
bonuses were paid during 2004.

Cash used in investing activities was $25.4 million for Calendar 2003, compared to $26.3 million
for Calendar 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the proceeds received from an insurance
recovery of $5.5 million during Calendar 2003 associated with a previously incurred loss on a claim
resulting from the sale of a business in 2000. Additionally, during 2002 we spent $3.9 million to
purchase the remaining 49.9% of People3, Inc. not previously owned by us. During Calendar 2003 and
Calendar 2002, we funded $2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of our investment commitment
to SI II, reducing our remaining commitment as of December 31, 2003 to $4.0 million. Spending on
property and equipment increased $7.8 million to $28.9 million during Calendar 2003, as compared to
$21.1 million during the same period of 2002.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $3.0 million for Calendar 2003, compared to $42.2 million
for Calendar 2002. We purchased $43.4 million of common stock for treasury during Calendar 2003, as
compared to $59.9 million during Calendar 2002 (see further discussion that follows under Stock
Repurchases). We received proceeds of $41.7 million from the exercise of stock options and the
purchase of stock by employees participating in the employee stock purchase plan during Calendar
2003, as compared to $17.9 million during the Calendar 2002.

At December 31, 2003, cash and cash equivalents totaled $230.0 million. The effect of exchange
rates increased cash and cash equivalents



by $12.4 million during Calendar 2003, and was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against
certain foreign currencies.

Obligations and Commitments

We have a Credit Agreement that provides for a $200.0 million term A loan facility and a five-year,
$100 million revolving credit facility. During the third quarter of 2004, we borrowed $200 million
under the term A loan facility, receiving net proceeds after debt issuance costs of $197.2 million.
In accordance with the requirements of the term A loan facility, we made a loan payment of $10.0
million in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, there was $190 million
outstanding on the term loan facility and $3.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the
revolving credit facility. Based on specified covenant requirements, our borrowing availability at
December 31, 2004 under the revolving credit facility was $59.2 million. Subsequent to December 31,
2004, we  entered into an amendment of the Credit
Agreement covenant requirements that resulted in additional borrowing capacity under the revolving
credit facility. As a result, the amended borrowing availability under the revolving credit
facility would have been $96.5 million at December 31, 2004.

The facilities bear interest equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin which varies based on
specified leverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, the current interest rate was 3.59%. The term A
loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five-year period ending August 12,
2009. The credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments from a portion of proceeds from
asset sales and proceeds from certain future debt issuances. The credit agreement includes
customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants primarily based on our financial results
and other measures such as contract value. The facilities also include commitment fees on the
unused portion of the revolving credit facility not subject to letters of credit.

On April 17, 2000, we issued, in a private placement transaction, $300.0 million of our unsecured
6% convertible subordinated notes due April 17, 2005 to Silver Lake  and
other noteholders. Interest accrued semi-annually by a corresponding increase in the face amount of
the convertible notes. In October 2003, the notes were converted into 49,441,122 shares of Gartner
Class A Common Stock. The conversion was in accordance with the original terms of the notes.

The determination of the number of shares issued upon conversion was based upon a $7.45 conversion
price and a convertible note of $368.3 million, consisting of the original face amount of $300
million plus accrued interest of $68.3 million. The unamortized balances of debt issue costs of
$2.8 million and debt discount of $0.3 million as of the conversion date were netted against the
outstanding principal and interest balances, resulting in a $365.2 million increase to
stockholders’ equity. Additionally, certain costs directly associated with the conversion, such as
regulatory filings, banking and legal fees totaling $0.6 million were charged to equity.

On December 27, 2004, we announced that we would acquire META in an all-cash transaction for $10.00
per share, or approximately $162.0 million, excluding transaction costs. While subject to
regulatory and stockholder approvals, we expect the transaction to be
effective April 1, 2005. The $1.7 million of META acquisition obligation in the table above relates to
additional nonrefundable acquisition expenses that we are obligated to pay. In order to fund the
purchase of META, we anticipate that we will use a combination of cash and our amended five-year
revolving credit facility. In connection with funding the META
transaction, we anticipate repatriating $52.0 million in cash
earnings from our non-US subsidiaries in early 2005.

We believe that our existing cash balances, together with cash from our operating activities and
the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five-year revolving credit facility, will be
sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term needs. We are currently evaluating
the option of establishing long-term debt as a permanent part of our capital structure. However,
there can be no assurances that such capital will be available to us or will be available on
commercially reasonable terms.

Tender Offer

On August 10, 2004, we announced the final results of our Dutch auction tender offer. We
repurchased approximately 11.3 million shares of our Class A Common Stock and 5.5 million shares of our Class B
Common Stock at a purchase price of $13.30 and $12.50 per share, respectively.



Additionally, we repurchased 9.2 million Class A shares from Silver Lake and certain
of its affiliates, which collectively owned approximately 44.4% of our Class A
Common Stock and are affiliated with two members of our Board of Directors, at a purchase price of
$13.30 per share. The total cost of the purchases was $346.2 million, including transaction costs of
$3.8 million.

Stock Repurchases

In July 2001, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of Class A and
Class B Common Stock. The Board of Directors subsequently increased the authorized stock repurchase
program to a total authorization for repurchase of $200.0 million. On a cumulative basis at
December 31, 2004, we have purchased $133.2 million of our stock under this stock repurchase
program. In connection with the tender offer, the Board of Directors terminated the stock
repurchase program in June 2004. The following table provides information related to our cumulative
repurchases under this program:

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we and our clients are affected
by the economy. The following section discusses many, but not all, of these risks and
uncertainties.

Economic Conditions

. Our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions
in general and more particularly by business conditions in the IT industry. A general economic
downturn or recession, anywhere in the world, could negatively affect demand for our products and
services and may further substantially reduce existing and potential client information
technology-related budgets. The economic downturn in the United States and globally has led to
constrained IT spending, which has impacted our business and if it were to continue could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,
including the ability to: maintain client retention, wallet retention and consulting utilization
rates, and achieve contract value and consulting backlog. To the extent our clients are in the IT
industry, the severe decline in that sector has also had a significant impact on their spending.

Organizational and Product Integration Related to Acquisitions

. We have made and may continue to
make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products
and services, including our pending acquisition of META. The risks involved in each acquisition or
investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition,
dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital, increased
indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the
ability to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired business, the
ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company, the time to train the sales force to
market and sell the products of the acquired company, the potential disruption of our ongoing
business and the distraction of management from our business. The realization of any of these risks
could adversely affect our business.

Restructuring, Reorganization and Management Team.

Our future success depends, in significant
part, upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel.
We have recently reorganized our business around specific client needs. As part of this
reorganization, a number of key management positions have been filled by the promotion of current
employees or the hiring of new employees. Additionally, we have restructured our workforce in order
to streamline operations and strengthen key consulting practices. If the reorganization and
restructuring of our business does not lead to the results we expect, our ability to effectively
deliver our products, manage our company and carry out our business plan may be impaired. On July
23, 2004, we announced that the Board of Directors named Eugene A. Hall as our Chief Executive
Officer. Mr. Hall succeeded Michael Fleisher, who had previously announced his intention to depart
as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, James C. Smith, a current Board member,
has been named non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors. Further, on September 28, 2004, we
announced that the position of President and Chief Operating Officer, previously held by Maureen
O’Connell, was eliminated and that Mr. Hall would assume direct responsibility for business
operations. If we cannot successfully integrate our Chief Executive Officer into our senior
management team, then our ability to effectively deliver our products, manage our company and carry
out our business plan may be impaired.

Acts of Terrorism or War.

Acts of terrorism, acts of war and other unforeseen events, may cause
damage or disruption to our properties, business, employees, suppliers, distributors and clients,
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Such
events may also result in an economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Competitive Environment

. We face direct competition from a significant number of independent
providers of information products and services, including information that can be found on the
Internet free of charge. We also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information
providers, including electronic and print media companies, some of which may have greater
financial, information gathering and marketing resources than we do. These indirect competitors
could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, limited barriers to entry
exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, additional new competitors may emerge
and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. Additionally,
technological advances may provide increased competition from a variety of sources. Increased
competition may result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services,
reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures. We may not be successful if we cannot compete
effectively on quality of research and analysis, timely delivery of information, customer service,
the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis, or price.

Renewal of Research Business by Existing Clients.

Some of our success depends on renewals of our
subscription-based research products and services, which constituted 54% of our revenues for
Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003. These research subscription agreements have terms that generally
range from twelve to thirty months. Our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to
numerous factors, including those described in this Annual Report. Additionally, as we implement
our strategy to realign our business to client needs, we may shift the type and pricing of our
products which may impact client renewal rates. While client retention rates were 80% at December
31, 2004 and 78% at December 31, 2003, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to have this
level of client renewals. Any material decline in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our
revenues and our financial condition.

Non-Recurring Consulting Engagements.

Consulting segment revenues constituted 29% of our revenues
for Calendar 2004 and 30% of our revenues for Calendar 2003. These consulting engagements typically
are project-based and non-recurring. Our ability to replace



consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors, including those described in this Annual
Report. Any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an
adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition.

Hiring and Retention of Employees

. Our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior
management, research analysts, consultants, sales and other key personnel. We face competition for
the limited pool of these qualified professionals from, among others, technology companies, market
research firms, consulting firms, financial services companies and electronic and print media
companies, some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals. Some
of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could impede
our short-term recruitment efforts. Any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train
additional qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in
our business, could adversely affect the quality of our products and services, and therefore, our
future business and operating results.

Maintenance of Existing Products and Services

. We operate in a rapidly evolving market, and our
success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and analysis to our
clients. Any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful to our
clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results. Further, if
our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research, our reputation
may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline. In addition, we must continue to
improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost-effective manner. Failure to
increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future
business and operating results.

Introduction of New Products and Services

. The market for our products and services is
characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis. To maintain our competitive
position, we must continue to enhance and improve our products and services, develop or acquire new
products and services in a timely manner, and appropriately position and price new products and
services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them. Any failure to achieve
successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations or financial position.

International Operations

. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of
North America, 37% for Calendar 2004. As a result, our operating results are subject to the risks
inherent in international business activities, including general political and economic conditions
in each country, changes in market demand as a result of exchange rate fluctuations and tariffs and
other trade barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes in regulatory
requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, different or overlapping tax
structures, higher levels of United States taxation on foreign income, and the difficulty of
enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property
rights in international jurisdictions. We rely on local distributors or sales agents in some
international locations. If any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us, we may not
be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis. Additionally, clients
of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new
agent.

Branding

. We believe that our “Gartner” brand is critical to our efforts to attract and retain
clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases. We may
expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the Gartner brand and may need to
increase our marketing budget, hire additional marketing and public relations personnel, expend
additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain
client brand loyalty. If we fail to effectively promote and maintain the Gartner brand, or incur
excessive expenses in doing so, our future business and operating results could be materially and
adversely impacted.

Indebtedness

. We have a $200.0 million senior revolving credit facility as well as a $100 million
revolving credit facility. The affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the credit facility
could limit our future financial flexibility. As a result of these covenants, our borrowing
availability at December 31, 2004 was $59.2 million, and would have been $96.5 million based on an
amendment to the Credit Agreement. The associated debt service costs of these facilities could
impair our future operating results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or
additional credit available to us, which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products
and services, respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring
substantial investments of additional capital.

Enforcement of Our Intellectual Property Rights

. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent,
trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect
our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights,
unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as
proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity
or provide significant protection for us. The laws of certain countries do not protect our
proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be
able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which
could adversely affect our competitive position. Our employees are subject to non-compete
agreements. When the non-competition period expires, former employees may compete against us. If a
former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non-competition
period, there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the non-compete
provision.

Possibility of Infringement Claims

. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us.
Regardless of the merits, responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly
litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may



not be offered or available on reasonable terms. If a successful claim is made against us and we
fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or
financial position could be materially adversely affected.

Potential Fluctuations in Operating Results

. Our quarterly and annual operating income may
fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, including the timing of the execution of
research contracts, which typically occurs in the fourth calendar quarter, the extent of completion
of consulting engagements, the timing of symposia and other events, which also occur to a greater
extent in the fourth calendar quarter, the amount of new business generated, the mix of domestic
and international business, changes in market demand for our products and services, the timing of
the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services, and competition in the
industry. An inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow, and achieve our forecasts,
may impact our operating and other activities. The potential fluctuations in our operating income
could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide
an unreliable indication of future operating results.

Significant Stockholders

. Silver Lake and its affiliates own approximately
42.2% of our Class A Common Stock and approximately 33.7% of our total common stock on a combined
basis as of February 28, 2005. Currently, the owners of our Class A Common Stock are only entitled
to vote for two of the ten members of our Board of Directors and vote together with the holders of
the Class B Common Stock as a single class on all other matters coming before the stockholders. Silver Lake
is restricted from purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms of a
Securityholders’ Agreement. This Securityholders’ Agreement also provides that we cannot take
certain actions, including acquisitions and sales of stock and/or assets without Silver Lake’s consent.
Additionally, ValueAct Partners and its affiliates own approximately 13.0% of our Class A Common
Stock, 22.7% of our Class B Common Stock and 14.9% of our total common stock on a combined basis as
of February 28, 2005. While neither Silver Lake nor ValueAct holds a majority of our outstanding shares,
they may be able, either individually or together, to exercise significant influence over matters
requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers,
consolidations and sales of our assets. Their interests may differ from the interests of other
stockholders.

Anti-takeover Protections

. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware
law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by
our Board of Directors. These provisions include:

•

The presence of a classified Board of Directors;

•

The existence of two classes of common stock with our Class B Common Stock having the ability to elect 80% of our Board
of Directors;

•

The ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock;

•

Advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings;

•

A preferred shares rights agreement; and

•

The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law.

These provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might
provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their Common Stock. We have announced
that we intend to eliminate our classified board structure and combine our two classes of common
stock, subject to the approval of our stockholders, at our next annual meeting of stockholders to
be held in the late spring or early summer of 2005. These actions could serve to make it easier
for a change of control to occur.

Non-Cash Compensation Charges in Future Periods.

On October 15, 2004, we announced that Eugene A.
Hall received an inducement grant of 500,000 shares of restricted stock with a market value on the
date of grant of $12.05 per share. As long as Mr. Hall remains an employee, the restriction on the
500,000 shares of restricted stock will lapse upon the earlier of (a) our 60 day average stock
price meeting certain targets, or (b) a change in control. The price targets are $20 for the first
300,000 shares, $25 for the next 100,000 shares and $30 for the remaining 100,000 shares. If our 60
day average stock price exceeds the stipulated per share target during the 60 day measurement
period, we will be required to record a non-cash compensation charge equal to the closing price of
our stock on the date the target is met times the number of shares associated with the applicable
target. For example, if our average 60 days stock price is $22 per share and the stock closes at
$22.50 per share, the first lapse shall result in us recording a $6.75 million non-cash
compensation charge (300,000 shares at $22.50/share).

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 123R, Share-Based Payments (“SFAS 123R”). The rule replaces SFAS No. 123 and APB 25 and
will require the recognition of expense for share-based payments, to include the value of stock
options granted to employees. The revised rule is effective for periods beginning after June 15,
2005, but early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt the new rule on July 1, 2005. We are
currently assessing the impact the revised rule will have on our financial position, cash flows,
and results of operations, but we believe it may have a material effect on our results of operations.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2004, we have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates since we had
$190.0 million drawn on our unsecured senior revolving credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank.
Under the revolving credit facility, the interest rate on borrowings is LIBOR plus an additional
100 to 150 basis points based on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. However, we believe that an increase or
decrease of 10% in the effective interest rate on available borrowings from our senior revolving
credit facility would not have a material effect on our future results of operations. Each 25 basis
point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate $0.5 million annual effect
under the revolving credit facility when fully utilized.

Investment Risk

We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity
investments. We invest in equity securities of public and private companies directly and through
SI II, of which we own 22% at December 31, 2004. SI II is engaged in making venture capital
investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or Internet-enabled companies (see Note 5 – Investments
in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2004, we had investments
in equity securities totaling $7.0 million. These investments are inherently risky as the
businesses are typically in early development stages and may never develop. Further, certain of
these investments are in publicly traded companies whose shares are subject to significant market
price volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions and poor operating results of the underlying
investments may result in us incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the original
carrying value of our investments. If there were a 100% adverse change in the value of our equity
portfolio as of December 31, 2004, this would result in a non-cash impairment charge of $7.0
million. We had no additional commitments to fund SI II as of December 31, 2004.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We face two risks related to foreign currency exchange: translation risk and transaction risk.
Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates
in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay
expenses in currencies other than the United States dollar. Since the functional currencies of our
foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries, the foreign
currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not
impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or
lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens against other
currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues
and expenses (as expressed in U.S. dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or
losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included
within Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Currency
transaction gains (losses), net were $(3.1) million during Calendar 2004, $0.5 million during
Calendar 2003, $(0.4) million during Calendar 2002, $(0.1) million during Transition 2002, and
$(0.8) million during Fiscal 2002.

From time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative
financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. Foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with gains and losses
recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2004, we had no foreign currency forward contracts or other
derivative financial instruments outstanding.

ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Our consolidated financial statements for Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003, Transition 2002 and for the
Fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, together with the reports of KPMG LLP, independent registered
public accounting firm, dated March 16, 2005, are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
beginning on Page 40.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE.

None.



ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls

Management conducted an
evaluation, as of December 31, 2004, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as
such term is defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) under
the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
alerting them in a timely manner to material Company information
required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under
the Act.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Gartner management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Gartner’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Management’s assessment was reviewed with the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.

Based on its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, management has concluded
that, as of December 31, 2004, Gartner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Gartner’s independent registered public accountants KPMG LLP, have issued an attest report on
management’s assessment of Gartner’s internal control of financial reporting. This report appears
on page 42.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

During our most recent fiscal
quarter, except as set forth below, there has not occurred any change
in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) and 15d- 15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We have dedicated significant
resources, including management time and effort, in connection with
our compliance with Section 404. As part of our compliance effort,
during the fourth quarter of 2004, we made certain improvements to
our internal controls, including adding additional controls, such as
management-level approvals, implementation of accounting and
reporting disclosure checklists, as well as more comprehensive
documentation of key control activities in the financial reporting
process.

for the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurs (plus any unpaid bonus from the prior

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

RELATIONSHIP WITH SILVER LAKE PARTNERS, L.P.

On April 17, 2000, we issued and sold an aggregate of $300 million principal amount of our
unsecured 6% Convertible Junior Subordinated Promissory Notes due April 17, 2005 to Silver Lake
Partners, L.P. (“Silver Lake”) and certain of Silver Lake’s affiliates and to Integral Capital
Partners IV, L.P. and one of its affiliates. In October 2003, these notes were converted into
49,441,122 shares of our Class A Common Stock. The determination of the number of shares issued
upon the conversion was based upon a $7.45 conversion price and a convertible note of $368.3
million, consisting of the original face amount of $300 million plus accrued interest of $68.3
million. In connection with the issuance of the notes, we agreed, among other things, that Silver
Lake would recommend two nominees for director and we would include two Silver Lake nominees on our
slate of nominees to be elected to our Board. This obligation exists while Silver Lake owns Class A
Common Stock representing at least 20 percent of the amount of Class A Common Stock into which the
notes were converted.

Silver Lake purchased $112,200 in research and consulting services from us during 2004 and has
contracted to purchase subscription research services from us in 2005 in the amount of $113,700.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES

Several of our other directors are employed by companies that purchase our research and consulting
services in the ordinary course of their business. The following table shows the amount of research
and consulting services purchased by each company during 2004 and the amount for which each company

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

KPMG LLP has audited our financial statements since September 1996. During 2004, KPMG performed

(2) Audit-related fees consisted primarily of audits of our employee benefit plan, as well as an
audit of a foreign subsidiary not required by statute or
regulation.

(3) Tax fees are fees associated with tax compliance in foreign locations, tax advice, and tax
planning.

The Audit Committee’s policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services
provided by the independent auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related
services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year
and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is
generally subject to a specific budget. The independent auditors and management are required to
periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the
independent auditors in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed
to date. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis. All
of the services relating to the fees set forth on the above table were pre-approved by the Audit
Committee.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity (deficit) and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 2004, the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, and the
year ended September 30, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 2004, the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, and the
year ended September 30, 2002, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Gartner, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
and our report dated March 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of,
and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting under Item 9A, that Gartner, Inc. (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Gartner, Inc. maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Gartner, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity (deficit) and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the
two-year period ended December 31, 2004, the three-month period ended December 31, 2002, and the
year ended September 30, 2002, and our report dated March 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.

GARTNER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation

. On October 30, 2002, the Company announced that the Board of Directors
approved a change in the Company’s fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31, effective
January 1, 2003. This change resulted in a three-month transitional period ending December 31,
2002. References to Transition 2002, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the three-month
transitional period ended December 31, 2002. References to Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, unless
otherwise indicated, are to the respective fiscal year period from October 1 through September 30.
References to Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002, unless otherwise indicated, are to
the respective twelve-month period from January 1 through December 31. The unaudited financial
information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002 is presented for comparative purposes.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. When
used in these notes, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Gartner, Inc. and its
subsidiaries.

Principles of consolidation

. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Investments in companies in which the Company owns less than 50% but have the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for
using the equity method. All other investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The results
of operations for acquisitions of companies accounted for using the purchase method have been
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations beginning on the closing date of acquisition.
Certain amounts in the prior year presentations have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.

Revenues and commission expense recognition

. The Company typically enters into annually renewable
subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and
recognized ratably over the applicable contract terms. The majority of research contracts are
billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All
research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that have
a 30-day cancellation clause but have not produced material cancellations to date. With the
exception of certain government contracts which permit termination and contracts with special
billing terms, it is Company policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as
a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed, which represents a legally enforceable claim,
and a corresponding amount as deferred revenue. For those government contracts that permit
termination, the Company bills the client the full amount billable under the contract but only
records a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, the Company only
records deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenue
attributable to government contracts was $40.9 million and $38.6 million at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had not recognized
receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of $4.2
million, and $6.6 million, respectively, which had been billed but not yet collected. The Company
records the commission obligation related to research contracts upon the signing of the contract
and amortizes the corresponding deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the
related revenues are earned.

Consulting revenues, primarily derived from consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services
(paid one-day analyst engagements), are based primarily on fixed fees or time and materials for
discrete projects. Such revenues are recognized as work is delivered and as services are provided
and are evaluated on a contract by contract basis. Unbilled fees receivables associated with
consulting engagements were $27.9 million at December 31, 2004 and $24.3 million at December 31,
2003.

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium,
conference or exhibition. In addition, the Company defers certain costs directly related to events
and expenses these costs in the period during which the related symposium, conference or exhibition
occurs. The Company policy is to defer only those costs, primarily prepaid site and production
services costs, which are incremental and are directly attributable to a specific event. Other
costs of organizing and producing Company events, primarily personnel and non-event specific
expenses, are expensed in the period incurred. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company
assesses on an event-by-event basis whether expected direct costs of producing a scheduled event
will exceed expected revenues. If such costs are expected to exceed revenues, the Company records
the expected loss in the period determined.

Other revenues includes software licensing fees which are recognized when a signed non-cancelable
software license exists, delivery has occurred, collection is probable, and the fees are fixed or
determinable. Revenues from software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the term
of each maintenance agreement, which is typically twelve months.

Cash and cash equivalents

. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates
fair value based upon their short-term maturity. Investments with maturities of more than three
months are classified as marketable securities.



Investments in equity securities

. The Company accounts for its investments in publicly traded
equity securities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” These investments meet the criteria for
classification as available for sale, given the Company’s ability and intent to sell such
investments, and are recorded at fair value and included in Other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on these marketable investments are recorded, net of
tax, as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the Stockholders’
equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses are recorded in Gain
(loss) on investments, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of equity
securities sold is based on specific identification. The Company assesses the need to record
impairment losses on investments and records such losses when the impairment of an investment is
determined to be other than temporary in nature. In making this assessment, the Company considers the
significance and duration of the decline in value and the valuation of comparable companies
operating in the Internet and technology sectors. The impairment factors the Company evaluates may change in
subsequent periods, since the entities underlying these investments operate in a volatile business
environment. In addition, these entities may require additional financing to meet their cash and
operational needs; however, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the
extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities, if at all. These impairment losses are reflected
in Gain (loss) on investments, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company accounts for investments that it does not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over using the cost method of accounting. Accordingly, these investments are carried at
the lower of cost or net realizable value and are included in Other assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets (see Note 5 - Investments). The equity method is used to account for investments in
entities that are not majority-owned and that the Company does not control but over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements

. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases. Property, equipment and leasehold
improvements, less accumulated depreciation and amortization consist of the following (in
thousands):

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, capitalized development costs for internal use software were $13.4
million and $13.1 million, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $17.4 million and
$32.5 million respectively. Amortization of capitalized internal software development costs totaled
$7.7 million, $10.6 million and $15.2 million (unaudited) during Calendar 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively, $4.4 million during Transition 2002, and $15.7 million during Fiscal 2002.

Software development costs

. The Company capitalizes certain computer software development costs and
enhancements, for software sold to customers, after the establishment of technological feasibility,
limited to the net realizable value of the software product, and cease capitalization when the
software product is available for general release to clients. Until these products reach
technological feasibility, all costs related to development efforts are charged to expense. Once
technological feasibility has been determined, additional costs incurred in development, including
coding, testing, and documentation, are capitalized. Amortization of software development costs is
provided on a product-by-product basis over the estimated economic life of the software, generally
two years, using the straight-line method and is recorded within Depreciation. Amortization of
capitalized computer software development costs begins when the products are available for general
release to customers. Periodic reviews are performed to ensure that unamortized capitalized
software development costs remain recoverable from future revenue. Capitalized software costs, net
of accumulated amortization, were $0.3 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Amortization expense was $0.9 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million (unaudited) in
Calendar 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, $0.4 million in Transition 2002, and $1.4 million in
Fiscal 2002.



Intangible assets

. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their
expected useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization included the following (in

Transition 2002, and $1.9 million for Fiscal 2002. Estimated aggregate amortization expense for
each of the next five Calendar years for intangible assets recorded in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2004 is as follows (in thousands):

Goodwill

. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the
estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired. Effective
October 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The
adoption of SFAS No. 142 eliminated goodwill amortization. Instead, goodwill is tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level, at least annually. A reporting unit can be an operating
segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management.
Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value,
goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit’s carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units were
estimated using discounted cash flows, market multiples, and other valuation techniques.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the Company’s segments as follows (in thousands):

During Calendar 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $2.7 million in the
Consulting segment related to certain operations in South America that were closed and for the exit
from other non-core operations. The remaining changes in goodwill in the table above were the
result of currency translation.



Impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets

. The Company reviews long-lived assets and
intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable. Such evaluation
may be based on a number of factors including current and projected operating results and cash
flows, changes in management’s strategic direction as well as other economic and market variables.
The Company’s policy regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill is to
evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Should events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying value might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows, an
impairment loss would be recognized. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on the
difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate
reflecting the Company’s average cost of funds and the carrying value of the asset (see Note 6 —
Other Charges).

Foreign currency translation

. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net within the Stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of a subsidiary are included in results of operations within Other income
(expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Currency transaction gains
(losses), net were $(3.9) million during Calendar 2004, $0.5 million during Calendar 2003, $(0.4)
million (unaudited) during Calendar, 2002, $(0.1) million during Transition 2002, and $(0.8)
million during Fiscal 2002. The $(3.9) currency transaction loss in Calendar 2004 includes a
foreign currency charge of $(3.1) million related to the closing of certain operations in South
America.

Income taxes

. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the
book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. The provision for
income taxes is the sum of the amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by
applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income for that year and the net changes
during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company
credits additional paid-in capital for
realized tax benefits arising from stock transactions with employees. The tax benefit on a
nonqualified stock option is equal to the tax effect of the difference between the market price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price. Undistributed earnings
of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. amounted to approximately $83.0 million as of December 31,
2004, for which no deferred taxes had been previously recorded in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, “Accounting for Income Taxes -
Special Areas” (“APB 23”). The Company anticipates
repatriating approximately $52.0 million of this amount in early 2005.
Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, a deferred tax charge of $5.0 million was
included in tax expense for 2004. This charge is the Company’s best current estimate of the tax
cost related to the dividend repatriation. Such estimate may be revised as a result of additional
guidance or clarifying language that may be issued by Congress and/or the Department of the
Treasury, or any changes in the Company’s factual assumptions that may occur.

Fair value of financial instruments

. The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash
equivalents, fees receivable, accounts payable, and accruals which are short-term in nature. The
carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair value. Investments in
publicly traded equity securities are valued based on quoted market prices. Investments in equity
securities that are not publicly traded are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value,
which approximates fair market value.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had $190.0 million outstanding under its senior revolving credit
facility. The carrying amount of these borrowings approximates fair value as the rate of interest
on the revolving credit facility approximates current market rates of interest for similar
instruments with comparable maturities.

Concentrations of credit risk

.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable equity securities and
fees receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to fees receivable are limited due to
the large number of clients comprising the client base and their dispersion across many different
industries and geographic regions.

Use of estimates

. The Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and disclosures, if any, of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Such estimates are required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America in the Company’s preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for such items as
allowance for doubtful accounts, investments, depreciation, amortization, income taxes and certain
accrued liabilities.

Accounting for stock-based compensation

. The Company has several stock-based compensation plans.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”) in accounting for our employee stock options and purchase rights and apply
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“SFAS 123”) for disclosure purposes only. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method is used to
account for stock-based employee compensation plans. The SFAS 123 disclosures include pro forma net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method of accounting had been used. If
compensation for employee stock compensation had been determined based on SFAS
123, the Company’s pro forma net income,
and pro forma income per share would have been as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

Recently issued accounting standards

. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123R, Share-Based Payments (“SFAS 123R”). The
rule replaces SFAS 123 and APB 25 and will require the recognition of expense for share-based
payments, to include the value of stock options granted to employees. The revised rule is effective
for periods beginning after June 15, 2005, but early adoption is permitted. The Company plans to
adopt the new rule on July 1, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact the revised rule
will have on its financial position, cash flows, and results of operations, and believe it may have
a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (Revised), “Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits” (“SFAS 132R”). SFAS 132R requires additional disclosures
relating to assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic pension cost. SFAS 132R is effective
for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2003. The Company’s required SFAS 132R disclosure is
included in Note 14 – Employee Benefits.

2—ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF META

On December 27, 2004, the Company and META announced an agreement under which the Company will
acquire META in an all-cash transaction for $10.00 per share, or approximately $162.0 million,
excluding transaction costs. META is a publicly owned, premier information technology and research
firm based in Stamford, Connecticut with 715 employees. In 2004, META generated $141.5 million in
revenue from 52 worldwide locations and had $90.8 million of assets at December 31, 2004. META
trades on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol “METG.” The Boards of Directors of both firms
have approved the agreement, and on January 31, 2004, the Company announced that notice had been
received from the Federal Trade Commission of early termination of the waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act concerning its planned acquisition of META. META filed
its definitive proxy statement with the SEC on February 17, 2005 and is scheduled to hold a special
meeting of stockholders to approve the transaction on March 23, 2005. Closing of the transaction,
which is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by META’s stockholders, is
expected to be effective April
1, 2005. See Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies for
additional information.



3—CORRECTION OF SFAS 87 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

Prior to Calendar 2004, the
Company did not apply the requirements of SFAS 87 – “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87) to a
defined-benefit pension plan in one of its international locations. The plan is statutory in
nature and covers approximately 85 individuals. The Company has determined that approximately $0.7
million of pension expense, net of tax, for this plan should have been recorded over the period
1994 through Calendar 2003 in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 87. Although the impact
of this additional expense is immaterial, the Company has restated its financial statements for
Calendar 2003 and Fiscal 2002 to record the pension expense as a correction of an error in prior
periods. The effect of these adjustments on previously reported operating results and earnings per
share is summarized below. The impact of the adjustments reduced total assets by $3.2 million and
total liabilities by $2.4 million at December 31, 2003. The impact of the adjustments
prior to Fiscal 2002 reduced retained earnings by approximately $0.5 million. There was no
effect on the previously reported liquidity or net operating cash flows for either Calendar 2003 or
Fiscal 2002. In Calendar 2004, the Company is recording pension expense in accordance
with SFAS 87.

The following table sets forth the impact of the restatement on prior periods (in thousands, except
per share data):

4—BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Fiscal 2002

On June 10, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 49.9% of People3, Inc., an authority on IT
human capital. People3 has been integrated with the Company’s consulting segment. Prior to this
acquisition, the Company owned 50.1% of People3 and consolidated its assets and liabilities and
results of operations. Revenues in Fiscal 2002 were approximately $6.9 million. The purchase price
was $3.9 million, of which $0.2 million was allocated to non-compete agreements, $0.3 million was
allocated to database-related assets and $3.4 million was allocated to goodwill. The non-compete
agreements are being amortized over the life of the agreements, three-years. The database-related
assets are being amortized over their estimated useful life of five years. In December 2004, the
Company decided to shutdown the operations of this non-core product line, the effects of which were
immaterial.

During Fiscal 2002, the Company completed additional acquisitions for total consideration of
approximately $0.7 million, of which $0.1 million was allocated to tangible assets, $0.8 million
was allocated to goodwill, $0.2 million was allocated to non-compete agreements and $0.4 million
was allocated to liabilities assumed. The non-compete agreements are being amortized over the
five-year term of this agreement.

5—INVESTMENTS

At December 31, 2004, the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other
investments had a cost basis and a fair value of $7.0 million and are included in Other assets in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2004, the Company had an unrealized gain of $0.1
million related to these investments.

The Company owns equity securities through two limited partnerships, SI Venture Associates (“SI I”)
and SI Venture Fund II (“SI II”), which are venture capital funds engaged in making investments in
early to mid-stage IT-based or Internet-enabled companies, of which the Company owns 100% of SI I
and 22% of SI II at December 31, 2004. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company made the
decision to liquidate SI I and to sell the Company’s interest in SI 11. In addition, in the fourth
quarter of Calendar 2004 the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million related to the liquidation of SI I,
to include $0.8 million for the writedown of the investment and $0.7 million in related shutdown
charges. No charges were recorded on SI II in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the
planned sale since the carrying value of the investment approximates its net realizable value. In
the third quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related
to the transfer of its investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in its ownership
percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the decrease in
ownership, the Company was relieved of all future capital calls, which totaled $4 million.



Impairment losses on these investments are
reflected in Gain (loss) on investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
carrying value of the Company’s investments held by SI I and SI II was zero and $6.7 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2004. The investment in SI II is not presented separately on the
balance sheet as a held for sale asset as the amount is not material.

At December 31, 2003, the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other
investments had a cost basis and a fair value of $10.9 million. Unrealized gains and losses at
December 31, 2003 were individually insignificant. During Calendar 2003, the Company received
proceeds of approximately $5.5 million, recorded as gain on investments, on insurance proceeds
received associated with a negotiated settlement regarding a claim, which occurred in Fiscal 2000,
arising from the sale of GartnerLearning. On September 1, 1998, the Company sold GartnerLearning, a
division that provided technology based training and services for IT professionals, to NETg Inc.
(“NETg”), a subsidiary of Harcourt, Inc. (formerly Harcourt Brace & Company), and the Company
recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $2.0 million. In addition, the Company recorded an
additional loss, as a loss on investments, of $6.7 million during Fiscal 2000 in connection with a
negotiated settlement of a claim arising from the sale of GartnerLearning.

During Calendar 2003, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0.9 million on a minority-owned
investment that is not publicly traded. The Company evaluated the investment for impairment
because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its
mandatorily redeemable equity. As a result of this, the holders of the mandatorily redeemable
shares have agreed to a recapitalization of the entity. At December 31, 2003, the Company wrote
the investment down to estimated of fair value. The estimate of fair value was based upon a
combination of valuation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis of future projections
of operating performance, market comparables and other available information.

During Transition 2002, the Company recognized impairment losses of $1.7 million associated with
the Company’s investment in SI I and SI II. During Fiscal 2002, the Company sold 748,118 shares of
CNET for $6.0 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $0.8 million, and recognized impairment losses
related to its SI investments of $2.5 million.

The Company’s share of equity gains in SI I and SI II was $0.1 million for both Calendar 2004 and
2003, $0.01 million for Transition 2002, and $0.2 million for Fiscal 2002.

SI and Other Investments – Related Party

The Company owns 100% of SI I and 22% of SI II at December 31, 2004. Both entities are managed by
SI Services Company, L.L.C., an entity controlled by a former CEO and Chairman of the Board, who
continues to be paid pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company, and
certain of the Company’s former officers and employees. Management fees incurred for SI Services Company,
L.L.C. are approximately $1.2 million per year. In addition, the Company provides access to
research and the use of certain office space at no cost to SI Services Company, LLC. The Company
had a total original investment commitment to SI I and SI II of $10.0 million and $30.0 million,
respectively. The commitment to SI I was fully funded in prior years. The Company made
contributions to the SI investments of $2.0 million and $1.5 million during Calendar 2003 and
Fiscal 2002, respectively. No contributions were made during Transition 2002. Of the $30.0 million
commitment to SI II, $4.0 million remained unfunded at December 31, 2003. In the third quarter of
Calendar 2004, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related to the transfer of
its investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in ownership percentage in SI II of
seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the decrease in ownership, the Company
was relieved of all future capital calls for SI II.

6—OTHER CHARGES

During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 the Company recorded Other charges of $11.9 million, of
which $5.9 million was for severance and benefits related to an announced workforce reduction. The
Company severed 40 employees and expects additional workforce reductions to occur during the first
quarter of Calendar 2005 as part of this effort. Other charges of $4.3 million during the third quarter
of Calendar 2004 primarily included severance costs associated with the departure of the Company’s
President and COO and former Chairman and CEO of $3.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Other
charges of $9.1 million during the second quarter of Calendar 2004 included $3.8 million of
severance costs associated with the departure of the Company’s
former Chairman and CEO, as well as $5.3 million of
costs associated with the termination of 30 additional employees. During the first quarter of
Calendar 2004, other charges of $10.5 million were primarily associated with a realignment of our
workforce. This workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the
fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 and has resulted in the termination of 132 employees, or
approximately 4% of the Company’s workforce, bringing the total terminations to 262 employees associated with
the action plan previously announced in December 2003.

For all of Calendar 2004, the Company recorded total charges of $29.7 million related to the
realignment of the Company’s workforce, including costs of $7.7 million related to the departure of
the Company’s President and COO and our former Chairman and CEO. This realignment resulted in the termination of 203
employees for the full year. The annualized savings from the termination of these employees should
be



approximately $23.3 million. However, the Company plans to reinvest a significant portion of these
savings into improving its products, processes, and infrastructure to help drive future growth.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company revised its estimates of
previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of
additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected
subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The Company also recorded a
charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the restructuring of
certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain
international and other non-core operations.

During Calendar 2003, the Company recorded Other charges of $29.7 million. Of these charges, $20.0
million are associated with the Company’s workforce reductions; $5.4 million is associated with the workforce
reduction announced in February 2003, and $14.6 million is associated with the workforce reduction
announced in December 2003. These workforce reductions resulted in the termination of 222 employees
and the payment of $7.6 million during Calendar 2003. In addition, approximately $9.7 million of
these charges relate to additional estimated costs and losses associated with excess facilities
that were previously reserved for as other charges during Fiscal 2002 and Transition 2002. The
increase in the estimated costs and losses on these facilities was a result of the continued
decline in market rents for the associated facility, as well as changes in estimates of timing of
sublease income.

During Transition 2002, the Company recorded other charges of $32.2 million. Of these charges,
$13.3 million relates to costs and losses associated with the elimination and reduction of excess
facilities, principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with
sub-lease arrangements. In addition, approximately $18.9 million of these charges are associated
with the Company’s workforce reduction and are for employee termination severance payments and related
benefits. This workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of 175 positions, or approximately
4% of the Company’s workforce at the time, and the payment of $11.0 million of termination benefits during
Calendar 2003.

During Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded other charges of $17.2 million. Of these charges, $10.0
million relates to costs and losses associated with the elimination of excess facilities,
principally leased facilities and ongoing lease costs and losses associated with sub-lease
arrangements. In addition, approximately $5.8 million of these
charges are associated with the Company’s
workforce reduction announced in January 2002 and are for employee termination severance payments
and related benefits. This workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of approximately 100
positions, or approximately 2% of the Company’s workforce at the time.

At December 31, 2004, $9.3 million of the aggregate termination benefits relating to the workforce
reductions remain to be paid, primarily in the quarters ended
March 31 and June 30, 2005. In addition, costs for excess
facilities will be paid until Calendar 2011, while the asset
impairments and other will be paid out during the first and second
quarters of Calendar 2005. The
Company will fund these costs from existing cash.

8—DEBT

The Company has an unsecured Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent for
the participating financial institutions thereunder, providing for a maximum of $200.0 million of
borrowings under a senior term A facility, and a five year, $100.0 million revolving credit
facility. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company borrowed $200 million under the term A loan
facility, receiving net proceeds after debt issuance costs of $197.2 million. In accordance with
the requirements of the term A loan facility, the Company made a loan payment of $10.0 million in
the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. At December 31, 2004, there was $190.0 million outstanding on
the term loan facility and $3.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit
facility.

The facilities bear interest equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin that varies based on
specified leverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, the current interest rate was 3.59%. The term A
loan facility is payable in equal quarterly installments over a five year period ending August 12,
2009. The credit facilities are subject to mandatory prepayments from a portion of proceeds from
asset sales and proceeds from certain future debt issuances. The credit agreement includes
customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants primarily based on the Company’s financial
results and other measures such as contract value. As a result of these covenants, our borrowing
availability at December 31, 2004 was $59.2 million. The facilities also include commitment fees on
the unused portion of the revolving credit facility not subject to letters of credit. The Company
paid a commitment fee of 0.30% to 0.50% on the unused revolving credit amount. During Calendar
2004, the weighted-average interest rate on the borrowings, which were only outstanding during the
third and fourth quarter, was 3.28%.

Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Company entered into an
amendment of the Credit Agreement covenant requirements, which resulted in additional borrowing
capacity under the revolving credit facility. As a result, the amended borrowing availability under
the revolving credit facility would have been $96.5 million at December 31, 2004.

On April 17, 2000, the Company issued, in a private placement transaction, $300.0 million of 6%
convertible subordinated notes (the “convertible notes”) to Silver Lake Partners, L.P. (“Silver
Lake”) and other noteholders. The convertible notes were scheduled to mature in April 2005 and had
been accruing interest at 6% per annum. Interest had accrued semi-annually by a corresponding
increase in the face amount of the convertible notes commencing September 15, 2000.

In October 2003, the convertible notes were converted into 49,441,122 shares of Gartner Class A
Common Stock in accordance with the original terms of the notes. The determination of the number of
shares issued upon conversion was based upon a $7.45 conversion price and a convertible note of
$368.3 million, consisting of the original face amount of $300 million plus accrued interest of
$68.3 million. The unamortized balances of debt issue costs of $2.8 million and debt discount of
$0.3 million as of the conversion date were netted



against the outstanding principal and interest balances, resulting in a $365.2 million increase to
stockholders’ equity. Additionally, certain costs directly associated with the conversion, such as
regulatory filing, banking and legal fees, totaling $0.6 million, were charged to equity.

As part of the original private placement transaction, two Silver Lake representatives were elected
to our ten-member Board of Directors. The Company also granted to Silver Lake the right to acquire
5% of any Company subsidiary that is spun off or spun out at 80% of the initial public offering
price.

The Company issues letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had outstanding letters of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank for $3.5 million.

9—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

On December 27, 2004, the Company announced that it would acquire META in an all-cash transaction
valued at $10.00 per share, or approximately $162.0 million, excluding transaction costs. While
subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, the Company believes the transaction will close in
the second quarter of Calendar 2005. In order to fund the purchase of
META, the Company anticipates that it
will use a combination of cash and the Company’s amended five-year revolving credit facility. In
connection with funding the META transaction, the Company anticipates repatriating $52.0 million in
cash earnings from its non-US subsidiaries in early 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Company had a $1.7 million nonrefundable obligation related to the META
acquisition.

The Company leases various facilities, furniture and computer equipment under operating lease
arrangements expiring between 2005 and 2025. Future minimum annual payments under non-cancelable
operating lease agreements at December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands):

Rental expense for operating leases was $25.2 million for Calendar 2004, $25.5 million for Calendar
2003, $7.0 million for Transition 2002, and $27.6 million for Fiscal 2002. The Company also has
commitments for office services, such as printing, copying, shipping and mail services, which
expire at various dates in 2005. The minimum obligation under these agreements is approximately
$1.8 million in the aggregate.

The Company is involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company believes the outcome of all current proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations when resolved in a
future period.

The Company has various
agreements that may obligate it to indemnify the other party with respect
to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in
the normal course of business under which it customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless
against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets
sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights. It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the
conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not been material. As of December 31,
2004, the Company was not aware of any indemnification agreements that would require material payments.

10—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Capital stock

. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to one vote
per share on all matters to be voted by stockholders and vote together as a single class, other
than with respect to the election of directors. Class A Common Stock stockholders are entitled to
one vote per share on the election of Class A directors, which constitute no more than 20% of the
directors, and Class B Common Stock stockholders are entitled to one vote per share on the election
of Class B directors, which constitute at least 80% of the directors. In addition, any Class B
Common Stock holder who owns more than 15% of the outstanding Class B Common Stock, will not be
able to vote all of his or her Class B Common Stock in the election of directors unless such holder
owns an equivalent



percentage of Class A Common Stock.

In February 2005, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the elimination of its
classified Board structure and approved the combination of the Company’s Class A and Class B common
shares. Both of these items are subject to stockholder approval at the Company’s annual meeting to
take place in the late spring or early summer of 2005.

The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its Class A or Class B common stock. While
subject to periodic review, the current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain all earnings
primarily to provide funds for continued growth. The Credit Agreement, dated August 12, 2004,
contains a negative covenant which may limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends. In addition,
the Amended and Restated Security Holders Agreement with Silver Lake Partners, L.P. requires the
Company to obtain Silver Lake’s consent prior to declaring or paying dividends.

Tender Offer.

On August 10, 2004, the Company announced the final results of its Dutch auction
tender offer. The Company repurchased 11.3 million shares of its Class A Common Stock and 5.5
million shares of its Class B Common Stock at a purchase price of $13.30 and $12.50 per share,
respectively. Additionally, the Company repurchased 9.2 million Class A shares from Silver Lake
Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (“Silver Lake”) at a purchase price of $13.30 per share. The total cost of the purchases
was $346.2 million including transaction costs of $3.8 million.

Stock repurchase program

. In July 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of
up to $75 million of Class A and Class B Common Stock. The Board of Directors subsequently
increased the authorized stock repurchase program to a total authorization for repurchase of $200
million. On a cumulative basis at December 31, 2004, the Company has purchased $133.2 million of
our stock under this stock repurchase program. In connection with the tender offer, the Board of
Directors terminated the stock repurchase program in June 2004.

11—STOCK PLANS

Stock option plans

.

The Company grants stock options to employees that allow them to purchase
shares of Class A Common Stock. These options are granted as an incentive for employees to
contribute to the Company’s long-term success. Options are also granted to members of the Board of
Directors and certain consultants. Generally, stock options are issued at their fair market value
at the date of grant. Most options vest either a) annually over a three-year service period, or b)
over a four-year vesting period, with 25% vesting at the end of the first year and the remaining
75% vesting monthly over the next three years. Options generally expire ten years from the grant
date. At December 31, 2004, 3.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock were authorized for grants
of options or restricted stock under the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan.

In February 2003, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2003
Plan”) which replaced its 1993 Director Stock Option Plan, 1994 Long Term Option Plan, 1996 Long
Term Stock Option Plan, 1998 Long Term Stock Option Plan and 1999 Stock Option Plan (collectively
the “Previous Plans”). Under the 2003 Plan, 9,928,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were initially
available for grant. Upon approval of the 2003 Plan, no further grants or awards were allowable
under the Previous Plans. However, any outstanding options or awards under the Previous Plans
remain outstanding until the earlier of their exercise, forfeiture, or expiry date.

A summary of stock option activity under the plans and agreement through December 31, 2004 follows:

Employee stock purchase plans

. In January 1993, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase
plan, and reserved an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance under this
plan. The 1993 plan expired during 2003. In March 2002, shareholders approved the 2002 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan with substantially identical terms. Eligible employees are permitted to
purchase Class A Common Stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an employee’s
compensation (or $21,250 in any calendar year), at a price equal to 85% of the Class A Common Stock
price as reported by the NYSE at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is lower.
No shares were issued during Transition 2002. During Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003 and Fiscal 2002,
443,959, 544,883, and 551,109 shares were issued from treasury stock at an average purchase price
of $9.33, $7.24, and $7.86 per share, respectively, from these plans. At December 31, 2002 and
September 30, 2002, 3.7 million shares were available for purchase under the 2002 plan. At December
31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had 2.7 million and 3.2 million shares, respectively, available for purchase
under this plan.

Restricted stock awards

.

Beginning in 1998, the Company awarded restricted stock under the 1991
Stock Option Plan and the 1998 Long Term Stock Option Plan. The restricted stock awards generally
vest in six equal installments with the first installment vesting two years after the award and
then annually thereafter for five years. In 2004, the Company made two awards of restricted stock
of 33,000 shares with market values of $11.96 and $12.78, respectively, on the date of grant under
the 2003 Plan in which the restrictions lapse over three years. An additional award of 175,000
shares under the 2003 Plan (which was forfeited in 2004), and an inducement award of 500,000 shares
to the Company’s new CEO were subject to performance based vesting. Except for the awards with performance
based vesting, awardees are not required to provide consideration to the Company other than
rendering service and have the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends. The employee may
not sell the restricted stock during the vesting period. In 1999, the Company also granted 40,500
stock options with an exercise price of $1.00 per share that vest on the same basis as the
restricted stock awards to certain international employees. Such stock options had a
weighted-average fair market value of $22.81 per stock option on the date of grant.

The Company had a total of 602,236 and 99,024 restricted shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There were no awards of restricted stock during
Calendar 2003. At December 31, 2004, the aggregate unamortized compensation expense for restricted
stock awards and the $1 stock option grants was $7.6 million and is included as Unearned
compensation, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total compensation expense recognized for the
restricted stock awards and the stock options granted with an exercise price of $1.00 per share was
$0.9 million, $0.9 million, $0.3 million, $1.3 million, for Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003,
Transition 2002, and for Fiscal 2002, respectively.

On October 15, 2004, the Company announced that its new CEO, Eugene A. Hall, had received an
inducement grant of 500,000 shares of restricted stock for which market value on the date of grant
was $12.05 per share. As long as Mr. Hall remains an employee, the restriction on the 500,000
shares of restricted stock will lapse upon the earlier of (a) the Company’s 60 day average stock
price meeting certain targets, or (b) change in control. The price targets are $20 for the first
300,000 shares, $25 for the next 100,000 shares and $30 for the
remaining 100,000 shares. In accordance with APB  25, the
Company’s 60 day average stock price exceeds the stipulated per share target during the 60 day
measurement period, the Company will be required to record a non-cash compensation charge equal to the
closing price of the Company’s stock on the date the target is met times the number of shares associated with
the applicable target. For example, if the Company’s average 60 day stock price is $22 per share and the
stock closes at $22.50 per share, the first lapse shall result in the Company recording a $6.75 million
non-cash compensation charge (300,000 shares at $22.50/share).

On October 15, 2004, Mr. Hall’s restricted stock award had a probability-weighted range of values
from zero to $16.0 million with a mean net present value of
approximately $3.7 million. The mean net present
value represents the weighted-average of the range of potential values. The range of values was
based on the present value of estimated discounted cash flows, which takes into consideration such
factors as the historical price and volatility of the Company’s
Class A common stock. The $3.7 million represents the fair value of the
restricted stock amount under SFAS 123. The fair value of the
restricted stock award for each price target is being amortized for SFAS 123
purposes over the expected vesting term of each target, ranging from 21 to
36 months.

12—COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of
securities that could share in earnings. When the exercise of stock options or conversion of
convertible debt is antidilutive they are excluded from the calculation.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per share
computations (in thousands, except per share).

The Company repurchased a significant number of its Class A and Class B Common Stock outstanding in
Calendar 2004. During the first half of Calendar 2004, the Company repurchased 413,225 shares of
its Class A Common Stock and 114,600 shares of its Class B Common Stock at an aggregate cost of
$6.1 million under its Stock Repurchase Program. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company
completed its “Dutch Auction Tender Offer” in which it repurchased 11,339,019 shares of its Class A
Common Stock and 5,505,489 shares of its Class B Common Stock at a purchase price of $13.30 and
$12.50 per share, respectively. Additionally, the Company also repurchased 9,228,938 Class A shares
from Silver Lake Partners and certain of its affiliates (“Silver Lake”) at a purchase price of
$13.30 per share. The total cost of the purchases was $346.2 million including transaction costs of
$3.8 million. In conjunction with the tender offer, the Board of Directors terminated the Stock
Repurchase Program during June 2004.

The following table presents the number of options to purchase shares (in millions) of Class A
Common Stock that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect would have
been antidilutive. During periods with reported income, these options were antidilutive because
their exercise prices were greater than the average market value of a share of Class A Common Stock
during the period. During periods with reported loss, all options outstanding had an antidilutive
effect.

awards were not included in the computation of diluted income (loss) per share because the effect

Transition 2002 were not included in the EPS calculation using the “as if converted” method because
the effect would have been antidilutive.

Current and long-term net
deferred tax assets were $13.4 million and $43.1 million as of December
31, 2004, and $8.9 million and $37.9 million as of December 31, 2003, respectively, and are
included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

The valuation allowance relates primarily to domestic state and local and foreign tax net operating
loss and capital loss carryforwards that more likely than not will expire unutilized. The net
increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $5.1 million in Calendar 2004 was primarily
due to increases in foreign net operating losses, state and local net operating losses, and federal
capital losses.
Approximately $2.6 million of the valuation allowance will reduce additional paid-in-capital upon
subsequent recognition of any related tax benefits related to stock options.

The higher effective tax rate in Calendar 2004 is primarily attributable to repatriation charges
offset by foreign tax credits and non-deductible book write-offs of
currency translation and goodwill. The Company took a $5.0
million deferred tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately $52.0 million in earnings
from the Company’s non US subsidiaries in 2005. The anticipated repatriation qualifies for a
one-time reduced tax rate pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This charge is the
Company’s best current estimate of the tax cost related to the dividend repatriation. Such
estimate may be revised as a result of additional guidance or clarifying language that may be
issued by Congress and/or the Department of the Treasury, or any changes in the Company’s factual
assumptions that may occur. The repatriation expense was partially offset by a deferred benefit of
$3.5 for the generation of current year foreign tax credits and the release of valuation allowance
on prior year foreign tax credits that will be used to offset foreign source income including the
repatriated amounts. The Company also recorded charges in Calendar 2004 to write-off certain
goodwill and currency translation adjustments. These charges are not deductible for tax purposes.
The impact of these items increased tax expense by approximately $1.3 million.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards of $26.4 million,
of which $19.2 million will expire in one year, $3.6 million
will expire in two years, and $3.6 million will expire in five
years; foreign tax credit carryforwards of $12.7
million, of which $9.7 million will expire in six years, and the remaining will expire in seven to
nine years; and federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.8 million which can be
carried forward indefinitely. The Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $28.9
million, the majority of which will expire in 20 years, state and local tax net operating loss
carryforwards of $250.2 million, of which $76.2 million will expire within one to five years, $40.2
million will expire within six to fifteen years, and $133.8 million will expire within sixteen to
twenty years. The Company also had $76.8 million in state and local capital loss carryforwards, of
which $69.6 million will expire as of December 31, 2004, $3.6 million will expire in Calendar 2005
and the remaining $3.6 million will expire in Calendar 2008. Lastly, the Company had foreign tax
loss carryforwards of $19.1 million of which $7.3 million will expire in one to ten years and $11.8
million that can be carried forward indefinitely.

14—EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Savings and investment plan.

The Company has a savings and investment plan covering substantially
all domestic employees. Company contributions are based upon the level of employee contributions.
In addition, the Company also contributes fixed and discretionary profit sharing contributions set
by the Board of Directors. Amounts expensed in connection with the plan totaled $9.5 million, $9.3
million, $1.9 million, and $9.5 million for Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003, Transition 2002, and for
Fiscal 2002, respectively.

Deferred compensation employee stock trust.

The Company has supplemental deferred compensation
arrangements for the benefit of certain officers, managers and other key employees. These
arrangements are partially funded by life insurance contracts, which have been purchased by the
Company. The plan permits the participants to diversify their investments. The value of the assets
held, managed and invested, pursuant to the agreement was $13.4 million and $11.6 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in Other assets. The corresponding
deferred compensation liability of $15.7 million and $13.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, is recorded at fair market value, and is adjusted with a corresponding charge or
credit to compensation cost, to reflect the fair value of the amount owed to the employee and is
included in Other liabilities. Total compensation expense recognized for the plan was
$0.3 million, $0.3 million, $0.1 million, and $0.6 million, for Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003,
Transition 2002 and Fiscal 2002, respectively.



Defined benefit pension plan.

The Company has a defined-benefit pension plan in one of its
international locations. The plan is statutory in nature, covers approximately 85 individuals, and
is accounted for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 87. Benefits paid under the plan are
based on years of service and employee compensation and employees vest under the plan after five
years of service. Benefits are paid under the plan through a reinsurance contract, which the
Company maintains with a third-party insurance company. The Company pays an annual insurance
premium for this coverage. In accordance with the requirements of SFAS 87, the reinsurance
contract does not qualify as a plan asset since it is maintained outside of the plan.

15—SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company manages its business in three reportable segments: research, consulting and events.
Research consists primarily of subscription-based research products. Consulting consists primarily
of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services. Events consists of various
symposia, conferences and exhibitions.

The Company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross
contribution margin. Gross contribution, as presented below, is defined as operating income
excluding certain selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of
intangibles and other charges. The accounting policies used by the reportable segments are the same
as those used by the Company.

The Company earns revenue from clients in many countries. Other than the United States, there is no
individual country in which revenues from external clients represent 10% or more of the Company’s
consolidated revenues. Additionally, no single client accounted for 10% or more of total revenue
and the loss of a single client, in management’s opinion, would not have a material adverse effect
on revenues.

The Company does not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by
segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation
of resources.

The following tables present information about reportable segments (in thousands). The “Other”
column includes certain revenues and corporate and other expenses (primarily selling, general and
administrative) unallocated to reportable segments, expenses allocated to operations that do not
meet the segment reporting quantitative threshold, and other charges. There are no intersegment
revenues:

The Company’s consolidated revenues are generated primarily through direct sales to clients by
domestic and international sales forces and a network of independent
international sales agents. The Company
defines “Other International Revenues” as revenues attributable to all areas located outside of the
United States, Canada and Europe. Most of the Company’s products and services are provided on an integrated
worldwide basis. Because of the integration of products and services delivery, it is not practical
to separate precisely the Company’s revenues by geographic location.



Long-lived assets exclude goodwill and
other intangible assets. Accordingly, the separation set forth in the table below is based upon
internal allocations, which involve certain management estimates and judgments.
