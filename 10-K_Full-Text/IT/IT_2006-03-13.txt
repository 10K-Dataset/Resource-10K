GARTNER, INC.

2005 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K




PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Gartner, Inc., founded in 1979, is a leading independent provider of research and analysis on
information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology
industries (the “IT industry”). We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to
approximately 10,000 client organizations. We serve a global client base consisting primarily of
chief information officers (“CIOs”) and other senior IT and business executives in corporations and
government agencies. We also serve technology companies and the investment community. Unless
otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this Form 10-K to
“Gartner,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms mean Gartner, Inc. and its subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis.

The foundation for all Gartner products is our independent research on IT issues. The findings
from this research can be delivered through several different media, depending on a client’s
specific business needs, preferences and objectives:

•

Research

—  provides research content and advice for IT professionals, technology companies and the investment
community in the form of reports and briefings, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed
specifically for CIOs and other senior executives.

•

Consulting

— consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day
analyst engagements) (“SAS”), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT
industry.

•

Events

— consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry.

MARKET OVERVIEW

In today’s dynamic IT marketplace, technology providers continually introduce new products with a
wide variety of standards and shorter life cycles. The users of technology — almost all
organizations — must keep abreast of these new developments, and make major financial commitments
to new IT systems and products. To plan and purchase effectively, these users of technology need
independent, objective, third-party research and consultative services. We believe that technology
accounts for a significant portion of all capital spending. The intense scrutiny on technology
spending ensures that our products and services remain necessary in the current economy because
clients need value-added, independent and objective research and analysis of the IT market.

We are a leading provider of independent and objective research and analysis of the IT industry,
and a source of insight about technology acquisition and deployment. Our global research community
provides provocative thought leadership. We employ more research analysts than any competitor. Our
experienced consultants combine our objective, independent research, with a practical, sought-after
business perspective focused on the IT industry. Our events are among the world’s largest of their
kind; gathering highly qualified audiences of senior business executives, IT professionals,
purchasers and vendors of IT products and services.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Our principal products and services are Research, Consulting, and Events:

•

RESEARCH.

Research on IT issues on a
global scale is the fundamental
building block for all Gartner
services. Our research agenda is
defined by clients’ needs, focusing
on the critical issues, opportunities
and challenges they face every day.
Research content, presented in the
form of reports, briefings, updates
and related tools, is delivered
directly to the client’s desktop via
our website. Our research analysts
provide in-depth analysis on all
aspects of technology and
telecommunications including:
hardware, software and systems,
services, IT management, market data
and forecasts, and vertical industry
issues.

Executive Programs (EP) are exclusive membership programs designed to help CIOs and other
executives become more effective in their enterprises. An EP membership leverages the knowledge and
expertise of Gartner in ways that are specific to the CIOs needs, and offers members-only
communities for peer-based collaboration. Members also receive advice and counsel from a personal
relationship manager who understands their goals and can ensure the most effective level of support
from Gartner. Our Best Practices programs bring together senior business and IT leaders for
exclusive events, multi-client research studies and ad hoc peer exchange forums. These programs
allow clients to learn from the experiences of their peers and share best practices in order to
solve common business problems, improve corporate performance and drive greater effectiveness. At
December 31, 2005, our various Executive Programs had a membership of approximately 3,500 CIOs and
other senior IT leaders.

•

CONSULTING.

Our consulting staff provides customized project consulting on the delivery,
deployment, and management of high-tech products and services in four focus areas: IT
Management and Measurement, Sourcing, Federal Government, and Market and Business Strategies:



Note 13 — Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-K
includes financial information about our geographic areas and our three business segments:
Research, Consulting and Events.

COMPETITION

We believe that the principal competitive factors that differentiate us from our competitors are:

We face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and
services. We compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers, including
electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly
with us in the future. Additionally, we face competition from our clients receiving information
from free sources through the Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we
do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide
additional or complementary services. However, we believe the breadth and depth of our research
assets position us well versus our competition. Increased competition may result in us losing
market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales
and marketing expenditures.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge
capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent,
trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect
our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality and ownership and to
the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property, and we also enter into agreements with
our employees as appropriate.

We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify,
create and protect it.



EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2005, we had 3,622 employees, of which approximately 276 were related to our
acquisition of META Group, Inc. (“META”) on April 1, 2005. Of the 3,622 employees at year-end 2005,
633 were located at our headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut; 1,541 were located at our other
facilities in the United States; and 1,448 were located outside of the United States. Our employees
may be subject to collective bargaining agreements at a company or industry level in those
countries where this is part of the local labor law or practice. We have experienced no work
stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be favorable.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we and our clients are affected
by the economy. The following section discusses many, but not all, of these risks and
uncertainties.

Our Operating Results Could be Negatively Impacted if the IT Industry Experiences an Economic Down
Cycle

. Our revenues and results of operations are influenced by economic conditions in general and
more particularly by business conditions in the IT industry. A general economic downturn or
recession, anywhere in the world, could negatively affect demand for our products and services and
may substantially reduce existing and potential client information technology-related budgets. Such
a downturn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations, including the ability to: maintain client retention, wallet retention and consulting
utilization rates, and achieve contract value and consulting backlog.

We Have Grown, and May Continue to Grow, Through Acquisitions and Strategic Investments, Which
Could Involve Substantial Risks

. We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of, or
significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products and services, including
our acquisition of META that we completed on April 1, 2005. The risks involved in each acquisition
or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition,
dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital, increased
indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the
ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company, the time to train the sales force to
market and sell the products of the acquired business, the potential disruption of our ongoing
business and the distraction of management from our business. The realization of any of these risks
could adversely affect our business.

We Face Significant Competition and Our Failure to Compete Successfully Could Materially Adversely
Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition

. We face direct competition from a
significant number of independent providers of information products and services, including
information that can be found on the Internet free of charge. We also compete indirectly against
consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print media companies,
some of which may have greater financial, information gathering and marketing resources than we do.
These indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future. In
addition, limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result,
additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or
complementary services. Additionally, technological advances may provide increased competition from
a variety of sources. However, we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us
well versus our competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete
against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market
share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased marketing
expenditures. Furthermore, we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of
research and analysis, timely delivery of information, customer service, and the ability to offer
products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis, or price.

We Depend on Renewals of Subscription Base Services and Our Failure to Renew at Historical Rates
Could Lead to a Decrease in Our Revenues.

Some of our success depends on renewals of our
subscription-based research products and services, which constituted 53% and 54% of our revenues
for Calendar 2005 and Calendar 2004, respectively. These research subscription agreements have
terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months. Our ability to maintain contract renewals
is subject to numerous factors, including the following:



•

delivering high-quality and timely analysis and advice to our clients;

•

understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients; and

•

delivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition.

Additionally, as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs, we may
shift the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates. While research
client retention rates were 81% and 80% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, there can be
no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals. Any material decline
in renewal rates could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition.

We Depend on Non-Recurring Consulting Engagements and Our Failure to Secure New Engagements Could
Lead to a Decrease in Our Revenues.

Consulting segment revenues constituted 30% of our revenues for
Calendar 2005 and 29% for Calendar 2004. These consulting engagements typically are project-based
and non-recurring. Our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors,
including the following:

•

delivering consistent, high-quality consulting services to our clients;

•

tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients; and

•

our ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff
to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential
consulting engagements.

Any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse
impact on our revenues and our financial condition.

We May Not be Able to Attract and Retain Qualified Personnel Which Could Jeopardize the Quality of
Our Products and Services

Our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management,
research analysts, consultants, sales and other key personnel. We face competition for the limited
pool of these qualified professionals from, among others, technology companies, market research
firms, consulting firms, financial services companies and electronic and print media companies,
some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals. Some of the
personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could impede our
short-term recruitment efforts. Any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional
qualified personnel as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business,
could adversely affect the quality of our products and services, and our future business and
operating results.

We May Not be Able to Maintain Our Existing Products and Services

. We operate in a rapidly evolving
market, and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and timely research and
analysis to our clients. Any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that
is useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating
results. Further, if our predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate
research, our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services may decline. In
addition, we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a
cost-effective manner. Failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could
adversely affect our future business and operating results.

We May Not be Able to Introduce the New Products and Services that We Need to Remain Competitive

.
The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information
and analysis. To maintain our competitive position, we must continue to enhance and improve our
products and services, develop or acquire new products and services in a timely manner, and
appropriately position and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our
costs of producing them. Any failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products and
services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial
position.

Our International Operations Expose Us to a Variety of Risks Which Could Negatively Impact Our
Future Revenue and Growth

. Approximately 38% of our revenues for Calendar 2005 were derived from
sales outside of North America. As a result, our operating results are subject to the risks
inherent in international business activities, including general political and economic conditions
in each country, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market demand as a result
of tariffs and other trade barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations,
changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations,
different or overlapping tax structures, higher levels of United States taxation on foreign income,
and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting
intellectual property rights in international jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on local
distributors or sales agents in some international locations. If any of these arrangements are
terminated by our agent or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or
on a timely basis, or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to
do business with us or our new agent.



We May Not be Able to Maintain the Equity in Our Brand Name

. We believe that our “Gartner” brand,
including our independence, is critical to our efforts to attract and retain clients and that the
importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases. We may expand our marketing
activities to promote and strengthen the Gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing
budget, hire additional marketing and public relations personnel, expend additional sums to protect
the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty. If we
fail to effectively promote and maintain the Gartner brand, or incur excessive expenses in doing
so, our future business and operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.

The Costs of Servicing Our Outstanding Debt Obligations Could Impair Our Future Operating Results

.
We have a $200.0 million term loan as well as a $125.0 million revolving credit facility. The
affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the credit facility could limit our future
financial flexibility. The associated debt service costs of these facilities could impair our
future operating results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit
available to us, which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services,
respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial
investments of additional capital.

If We Are Unable to Enforce and Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights Our Competitive Position
May be Harmed

. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret,
confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property
rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties
may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Our intellectual
property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant
protection for us. The laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same
extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our
intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect
our competitive position. Our employees are subject to non-compete agreements. When the
non-competition period expires, former employees may compete against us. If a former employee
chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non-competition period, there is no
assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to enforce the non-compete provision.

We May be Subject to Infringement Claims

. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us.
Regardless of the merits, responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly
litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered
or available on reasonable terms. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop
or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial position could
be materially adversely affected.

Our Operating Results May Fluctuate From Period to Period and May Not Meet the Expectations of
Securities Analysts or Investors, Which May Cause the Price of Our Common Stock to Decline.

Our
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors,
including the timing of the execution of research contracts, which typically occurs in the fourth
calendar quarter, the extent of completion of consulting engagements, the timing of symposia and
other events, which also occur to a greater extent in the fourth calendar quarter, the amount of
new business generated, the mix of domestic and international business, changes in market demand
for our products and services, the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new
products and services, and competition in the industry. An inability to generate sufficient
earnings and cash flow, and achieve our forecasts, may impact our operating and other activities.
The potential fluctuations in our operating results could cause period-to-period comparisons of
operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating
results. Furthermore, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts
or investors in the future. If this occurs, the price of our stock would likely decline.

Interests of Certain of Our Significant Stockholders May Conflict With Yours

. Silver Lake Partners,
L.P. (“SLP”) and its affiliates own approximately 33.0% of our common stock as of February 28,
2006. SLP is restricted from purchasing additional stock without our consent pursuant to the terms
of a Securityholders’ Agreement. This Securityholders’ Agreement also provides that we cannot take
certain actions, including acquisitions and sales of stock and/or assets without SLP’s consent.
Additionally, ValueAct Partners and its affiliates own approximately 16.3% of our common stock as
of February 28, 2006. While neither SLP nor ValueAct holds a majority of our outstanding shares,
they may be able, either individually or together, to exercise significant influence over matters
requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers,
consolidations and sales of our assets. Their interests may differ from the interests of other
stockholders.

Our Anti-takeover Protections May Discourage or Prevent a Change of Control, Even if a Change in
Control Would be Beneficial to Our Stockholders

. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a
transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions include:

•

The ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock;

•

Advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings;

•

A preferred shares rights agreement; and

•

The anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law.



These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that
might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their Common Stock.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

There are no material unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or
more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the
Securities Act of 1934.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Our corporate headquarters is located in approximately 213,000 square feet of leased office space
in three buildings located in Stamford, Connecticut, USA. These facilities accommodate research and
analysis, marketing, sales, client support, production, and corporate administration. The leases on
these facilities expire in 2010; however, the leases do contain renewal options. We have a
significant presence in the United Kingdom with approximately 72,000 square feet of leased office
space in two buildings located in Egham, UK, for which the leases expire in 2020 and 2025,
respectively. We have an additional 25 domestic and 50 international locations that support our
research and analysis, domestic and international sales efforts, and other functions, which
includes certain META locations that we have decided to continue to lease. As part of our
continuing effort to adjust our office space as needs change, during 2005 we reduced our office
space in San Jose, California by consolidating employees from two buildings into one building and
continued to close or reduce office space where appropriate. We continue to constantly assess our
space needs as our business changes, but we believe that our existing facilities are adequate for
our current needs and that additional space will be available as needed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed the field work portion of an audit of our
federal income tax returns for tax years ended September 30, 1999, through 2002. In October 2005,
we received an Examination Report indicating proposed changes that primarily relate to the
valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments
under a cost sharing arrangement between Gartner Inc. and one of its foreign subsidiaries. Gartner
disagrees with the proposed adjustments relating to valuation and the cost sharing arrangement and
intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as
appropriate. However, if the IRS were to ultimately prevail on the issues, it could result in
additional taxable income for the years under examination of approximately $130.7 million and an
additional federal cash tax liability of approximately $41.0 million. The Company recorded a
provision in prior periods based on our estimate of the amount for which the claim will be settled,
and no additional amount was booked in the current period. Although the final resolution of the
proposed adjustments is uncertain, we believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of
operations. The IRS has
commenced an examination of tax years 2003 and 2004. There have been no significant developments
to date.

On December 23, 2003, Gartner was sued in an action entitled

Expert Choice, Inc. v. Gartner,
Inc.

, Docket No. 3:03cv02234, United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.
The plaintiff, Expert Choice, Inc., seeks unspecified amount of damages for claims relating to
royalties for the development, licensing, marketing, sale and distribution of certain computer
software and methodologies. The case is currently in the discovery phase. Subsequently, in January
2004, an arbitration demand was filed against Decision Drivers, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, and
against Gartner, Inc., by Expert Choice. The arbitration demand described the claim as being in
excess of $10.0 million, but did not provide further detail. On February 22, 2006, we were
informed of an offer from Expert Choice’s counsel to settle the matter for $35.0 million. We
immediately rejected Expert Choice’s settlement offer since we believe we have meritorious defenses
against the claims and we intend to continue to vigorously defend the case.

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in
excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations when resolved in a future
period.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

We did not submit any matter to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of the year
covered by this Annual Report.



PART II

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

In the third quarter of Calendar 2005 we eliminated our dual class capital structure by combining
each share of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock into a single class of
common stock. As of February 28, 2006, there were approximately 3,065 holders of record of our
common stock which trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol IT.

DIVIDEND POLICY

We currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock. While subject to periodic review, the
current policy of our Board of Directors is to retain all earnings primarily to provide funds for
continued growth. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2005, contains a
negative covenant, which may limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, our Amended and
Restated Security Holders Agreement with Silver Lake Partners, L.P. requires us to obtain Silver
Lake’s consent prior to declaring or paying dividends.

The equity compensation plan information set forth in Part III, Item 12 of this Form 10-K is hereby
incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 5.

SHARE REPURCHASES

In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005 our Board of Directors authorized a $100.0 million common
share repurchase program. The following table provides detail related to repurchases of our common
stock for treasury in the fourth quarter of 2005 under this program:

OVERVIEW

With the convergence of IT and business, technology has become increasingly more important —
not just to technology professionals, but also to business executives. We are an independent and
objective research and advisory firm that helps IT and business executives use technology to build,
guide and grow their enterprises.

We employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research
intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market-leading position and brand
franchise. Our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that
intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging, campaigning and
cross-selling of our products and services. Our diversified business model provides multiple entry
points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting and
events. A key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying
relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering
strategically relevant research and analysis.

We intend to maintain a balance between (1) pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a
strict focus on growing our three core businesses and (2) generating profitability through a
streamlined cost structure.

We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events.

•

Research

provides research content and advice for IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community in
the form of reports and briefings, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for
CIOs and other senior executives.

•

Consulting

consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day
analyst engagements) (“SAS”), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT
industry.

•

Events

consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry.

We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our
business segments:

BUSINESS SEGMENT

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

Research

Contract value

represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related
research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated
as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific
point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract.

Client retention rate

represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business
relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage
basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients
from a year ago.

Wallet retention rate

represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have
retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a
percentage basis by dividing the contract value



BUSINESS SEGMENT

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

of clients, who were clients one year
earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds
client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or
increased spending by retained clients, or both.

Number of executive program members

represents the number of paid participants in
executive programs.

Consulting

Consulting backlog

represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting,
measurement and strategic advisory services engagements.

Utilization rates

represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization
rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours
billed by total hours available to bill.

Billing Rate

represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours.

Average annualized revenue per billable headcount

represents a measure of the revenue
generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by
multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the average utilization percentage
times the billable hours available for one year.

Events

Number of events

represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period.

Number of attendees

represents the number of people who attend events.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

During Calendar 2005, we acquired META Group, Inc. (“META”) in an all-cash transaction for $10.00
per share, or approximately $168.3 million, excluding transaction costs of $8.1 million. META was a
publicly owned, premier information technology and research firm that was based in Stamford,
Connecticut with about 715 employees. In 2004, META generated $141.5 million in revenue from 52
worldwide locations and had $90.8 million of assets at December 31, 2004. The results of
operations of META are included in our consolidated financial results beginning April 1, 2005, the
date of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2005 we have fully and successfully integrated META
into our operations.

We initiated and completed several actions during Calendar 2005 to enhance shareholder value. We
simplified our capital structure by eliminating our dual class stock, and since July 7

th

our common stock has been trading under one ticker symbol—IT. We believe this change increased
the trading liquidity of our common stock for our shareholders. In September we completed a buy
back of certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash, which resulted in the tender and
cancellation of approximately 6.4 million options. We undertook the buy back to reduce the option
overhang resulting from the high number of options outstanding. In October our Board of Directors
authorized a $100.0 million common share repurchase program, and we repurchased approximately
838,000 of our common shares by the end of the year.

We enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during Calendar 2005 by amending our Credit
Agreement. In addition to increasing our available credit and securing a more favorable
amortization schedule, we also obtained more favorable covenant terms. We also reduced our exposure
to rising interest rates on the term portion of the loan facility by entering into an interest rate
swap agreement in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, which effectively converted the base
floating rate on the base term loan to a fixed rate. We ended Calendar 2005 with $70.3 million in
cash, which we believe is sufficient to meet our current needs, and our stockholders’ equity at
December 31, 2005 was $146.6 million.

We believe that we have stabilized our core Research business and will continue to focus on growing
its revenues. Research revenue was up 9% over the prior year, to $523.0 million; revenue was up
about 3% excluding the impact of META and the effect of foreign currency. At December 31, 2005,
contract value was $592.6 million, up 16%, or $83.4 million, from $509.2 million at December 31,
2004. This represents our highest contract value since September 30, 2000 and our second highest
level ever. In addition, the growth in contract value shows increases across all regions as well as
across the entire product portfolio. Our Research client retention rate at December 31, 2005
increased to 81% from 80% at the prior year-end, while wallet retention was down to 93% from 95%
over the same period.

Consulting revenue for Calendar 2005 was up 16% over the prior year (revenue was up 11% excluding
META and foreign currency impact), and we ended Calendar 2005 with a backlog of $119.9 million, a
7% increase from December 31, 2004. During Calendar 2005, our average consultant utilization rate
was 62%, compared to 63% in the prior year, while billable headcount increased to 525 at December
31, 2005, compared to 475 at December 31, 2004. Our average annualized revenue per billable
headcount was above $375,000.

Our Events business continues to deliver consistent and profitable growth. Our emphasis on managing
the Events portfolio to retain our long-time successful events and introduce promising new events
has resulted in continued positive revenue performance, with Calendar 2005 revenue up 9% over the
prior year. Same event revenue also increased, up 5% over the prior year. Contributing to the
increased



revenue was a substantial increase in the number of events, with 70 held during Calendar 2005 as
compared to 56 held in Calendar 2004.

FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS

Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many
factors, including: the timing of Symposia, our flagship event that normally occurs during the
fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of
domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services;
changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new
products and services; and competition in the industry. The potential fluctuations in our operating
income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could
provide an unreliable indication of future operating results.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting
policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an
understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective
judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.

Revenue recognition

— We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (“SAB 101”), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
104, Revenue Recognition (“SAB 104”). Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:

The preliminary purchase price allocation of the META acquisition includes an estimate of the fair
value of the cost to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation assumed from META. The estimated fair
value of the deferred revenue obligation was determined by estimating the costs to provide the
services plus a normal profit margin, and did not include any costs associated with selling
efforts. As a result, in allocating the purchase price we recorded adjustments to reduce the
carrying value of META’s March 31, 2005 deferred revenue by approximately $12.6 million.
Consequently, revenues related to META contracts existing at the date of acquisition in the amount
of approximately $9.0 million that would have been recorded by META had it remained an independent
entity were not recognized in Calendar 2005, and the remaining $3.6 million will impact Calendar
2006. As former META customers renew their contracts, we will recognize the full value of revenue
from those new contracts over the respective contract periods.

Uncollectible fees receivable

— The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and
allowance reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings. The measurement of likely and probable
losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience,
aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial
health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material
estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information
about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could
cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit
quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they
come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total
fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands):

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

— The evaluation of goodwill is performed in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, — “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill
amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The
evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require
management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business
operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine
that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an
impairment charge, for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit, to earnings in our financial
statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following:

Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the
valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these
valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to
uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. During
Calendar 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.7 million in the first quarter relating to
goodwill associated with certain operations in South America that were closed, and in the fourth
quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 million related to the exit from certain
non-core product lines.

Accounting for income taxes

— As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our
current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets
and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the
availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and
ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation
allowance. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in
the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would
increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we
would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment
to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was
made.

We operate in numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations or profitability in
each jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given
year. In addition, our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax
authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of
additional taxes. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these
audits. However, resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances
that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided.

In October
2005 we received an IRS Examination Report showing proposed changes
that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed
to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost
sharing arrangement. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional
information.

Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals

— We record accruals for severance costs, lease
costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of
actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce
ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease
payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based
on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those
estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due
to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved.
During Calendar 2005 we revised our previous estimate for costs and losses associated with excess
facilities and we recorded a charge of approximately $8.2 million, primarily due to a reduction of
office space in San Jose, California, where we consolidated employees from two buildings into one.
The charge is included in Other charges along with severance, the option buyback, impairment, and
other costs. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during
each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may
require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until
after year end.

CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR

On October 30, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a change of our fiscal
year-end from September 30 to December 31, effective January 1, 2003. This change resulted in a
three-month transitional period ending December 31, 2002. References to Transition 2002, unless
otherwise indicated, refer to the three-month transitional period ended December 31, 2002.
References to Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, unless otherwise indicated, are to the respective fiscal
year period from October 1 through September 30. References to Calendar 2006, Calendar 2005,
Calendar 2004, Calendar 2003, and Calendar 2002, unless otherwise indicated, are to the



respective twelve-month period from January 1 through December 31.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CALENDAR 2005 VERSUS CALENDAR 2004

Total revenues increased 11%, or $95.2 million, to $989.0 million during Calendar 2005 from $893.8
million during Calendar 2004.

•

Research

revenues increased 9% in Calendar 2005 to $523.0 million,
compared to $480.5 million in Calendar 2004, and comprised
approximately 53% and 54% of total revenues in Calendar 2005 and
Calendar 2004, respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues in Calendar 2005 of $301.1 million were up 16%
compared to the $259.4 in Calendar 2004, and comprised
approximately 30% and 29% of total revenues in Calendar 2005 and
Calendar 2004, respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $151.3 million in Calendar 2005, an increase
of 9% from the $138.4 million in Calendar 2004, and comprised
approximately 15% of total revenues in both periods.

•

Other

revenues, consisting principally of reprint and software
licensing fees, decreased 13% to $13.6 million in Calendar 2005
from $15.5 million in Calendar 2004.

The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a $1.1 million negative effect on
total revenues for Calendar 2005 compared to Calendar 2004, while the META purchase added
approximately $50.0 million of revenue. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation and
the META acquisition, revenues would have increased approximately 5% year-over-year. See the
Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues.

Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients
increased 9% to $611.0 million in Calendar 2005 from $559.4 million in Calendar 2004. Revenues from
sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) increased 13% to $296.8 million in
Calendar 2005 from $263.0 million in Calendar 2004. Revenues from sales to clients in other
international regions increased 14% to $81.2 million in Calendar 2005 from $71.4 million in
Calendar 2004.

Cost of services and product development increased $52.1 million, or 12%, to $486.6 million in
Calendar 2005 from $434.5 million in Calendar 2004, with foreign currency translation having a
negligible impact. The increase in cost of services and product development on a year-to-date basis
resulted primarily from an increase in salary and benefits expense of approximately $33.5 million,
primarily driven by the addition of 140 people related to the META purchase, and higher bonus
expense and sales commissions of $14.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The increase in
bonus expense reflects the Company’s decision to restore bonus payouts to a competitive level. In
addition, we had $5.3 million of higher conference expenses related to an increase in the number of
events and attendees.

Cost of services and product development in Calendar 2005 benefited by the reversal of $2.1 million
of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals. Additionally, cost of services and product
development during Calendar 2004 benefited by the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years’
incentive compensation program accruals. For Calendar 2005 and 2004, cost of services and product
development as a percentage of sales was 49% for both periods.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $47.4 million, or 14%, to $397.3 million in
Calendar 2005 from $349.8 million in Calendar 2004, with foreign currency translation having a
negligible impact. The increase in SG&A expenses on a year-to-date basis was primarily driven by
our continued investment in our sales organization, in which we now have over 700 sales associates,
a 17% increase over Calendar 2004, reflecting the addition of 110 sales associates in 2005. We
added 111 people related to the META purchase, including 80 sales associates, accounting for
approximately $10.7 million of the increase. In addition to the $10.7 million increase attributable
to META, other salary and benefit increases totaled $12.1 million, while bonus expense and sales
commissions increased by $6.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Also, we had approximately
$16.4 million of additional external consulting, facilities, outsourcing, and other charges. These
charges were offset by the favorable impact of approximately $4.4 million of lower costs, primarily
marketing, and production. SG&A expenses in Calendar 2005 benefited by the reversal of $0.9
million of prior years’ incentive compensation program accruals. During Calendar 2004, SG&A
expenses benefited by the reversal of $3.3 million of prior year’s incentive compensation program
accruals. During Calendar 2004 the Company reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts by $3.7
million as a result of increased collections and a decline in write-offs.

Depreciation expense for Calendar 2005 decreased 8% to $25.5 million, compared to $27.6 million for
Calendar 2004. The reduction is due to a decline in capital spending, reflecting our disciplined
capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives.

Amortization of intangibles increased to $10.2 million in Calendar 2005 from $0.7 million in the
prior year due to the amortization of the $25.6 million of intangibles asset acquired in the META
acquisition. The majority of the intangibles related to the META acquisition will be fully
amortized by the end of Calendar 2006.



Goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in Calendar 2004, reflecting the write-off of goodwill
related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and other non-core product lines.

Other charges during Calendar 2005 were $29.2 million, which includes $10.7 million related to
workforce reductions, $6.0 million for an option buyback, $8.2 million related to a reduction in
office space, and $4.3 million of other charges. The Company severed a total of 150 employees in
Calendar 2005 and estimates the annualized savings from the termination of these employees to be
approximately $15.2 million. The Company plans to reinvest a significant portion of these savings
into improving its products, processes, and infrastructure to help drive future growth.

During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $1.5 million for
costs associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits for 27
employees. In addition, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005 the Company reversed
approximately $0.7 million of previously accrued severance benefits because the amounts actually
paid were less than estimated. During the third quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded
other charges of $6.0 million related to its completion of a one time offer to buy back certain
vested and outstanding stock options for cash (See Note 8 — Equity and Stock Programs in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During the second quarter of
Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $8.2 million. Included in the second quarter
charge was $8.2 million of costs primarily related to the reduction of office space in San Jose,
California, by consolidating employees from two buildings into one. The Company also recorded a
charge of $0.6 million associated with certain stock combination expenses, which was offset by a
reversal of approximately $0.9 million of accrued severance and other charges that the Company
determined would not be paid. During the first quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company recorded other
charges of $14.3 million. Included in the charge was $10.6 million for costs associated with
employee termination severance payments and related benefits. The workforce reduction was a
continuation of the plan announced in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 which resulted in the
termination of 123 employees during the three months ended March 31, 2005. In addition, during the
first quarter of Calendar 2005 the Company also recorded other charges of approximately $3.7
million, primarily related to a restructuring of the Company’s international operations.

Other charges during Calendar 2004 were $35.8 million. Included in this amount was $29.7 million
related to severance and benefits for 203 employees, including costs of $7.7 million related to the
departure of our President and COO and our Chairman and CEO. Of the 203 employees, 132 were severed
as part of the action plan announced in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003. During Calendar 2004
the Company also revised its estimate of previously recorded costs and losses associated with
excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due
to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated
periods of subleases. The Company also recorded charges in Calendar 2004 of $1.9 million related to
the restructuring of certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit
from certain international and other non-core operations.

(Loss) gain on investments, net for Calendar 2005 includes non-cash charges of $5.1 million and
$0.2 million during the first and second quarters, respectively, primarily related to writedowns of
its investment in SI Venture Fund II, L.P. (“SI II”) which the Company had decided to sell in the
fourth quarter of Calendar 2004. The Company recorded the writedown in the first quarter of
Calendar 2005 to reduce the investment to its estimated net realizable value after receiving
preliminary indications of interest to acquire the investment for less than its recorded value. The
Company took the additional writedown in the second quarter of Calendar 2005 based on a preliminary
sale agreement for which the proceeds were less than the recorded value. On August 2, Calendar
2005, the Company sold its investment in SI II for approximately $1.3 million, with no resulting
gain or loss recorded on the sale since the investment was already at net realizable value. During
the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005, the Company sold an investment in common stock it had acquired
in the META acquisition for $0.7 million, and recorded a loss of $0.5 million, which is recorded in
(Loss) gain from investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(Loss) gain on investments, net for Calendar 2004 was a loss of $3.0 million. In the fourth quarter
of Calendar 2004, the Company made the decision to liquidate its equity investments in SI Venture
Associates, L.L.C. (“SI I”) and to sell the Company’s interest in SI II. SI I and SI II were
venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or
Internet-enabled companies, of which the Company owned 100% of SI I and 22% of SI II at December
31, 2004. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million
related to the liquidation of SI I, to include $0.8 million for the writedown of the investment and
$0.7 million in related shutdown charges. No charges were recorded on SI II in the fourth quarter
of Calendar 2004 related to the planned sale since management believed that the carrying value of
the investment approximated its net realizable value. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, the
Company recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related to the transfer of an investment to SI
II, as well as a decrease in the Company’s ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis
points. The carrying value of the Company’s investments held by SI I and SI II were zero and $6.7
million, respectively, at December 31, 2004.

Other (expense), net for Calendar 2005 of $2.9 million consists primarily of net foreign currency
exchange gains and losses. Other (expense), net of $3.9 million in Calendar 2004 includes the
non-cash write-off of $3.1 million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments
associated with certain of our operations in South America that we have closed. As a result of this
decision we were required to reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated
within equity to earnings, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52
“Foreign Currency Translation.”



Provision for income taxes was 144.8% and 51.0% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2005 and
2004, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2005, as compared to that
of Calendar 2004, is principally due to the fact that the Company generated less income in low tax
jurisdictions as compared to the prior year and recorded valuation allowances against capital
losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The impact of these items is offset, in part, by
benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for
interest costs related to tax contingencies. The impact of the various positive and negative
adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2004.

In Calendar 2004, we took a $5.0 million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately
$52.0 million in earnings from our non-US subsidiaries in Calendar 2005. The repatriation was
expected to qualify for a one-time reduced tax rate pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act.
(AJCA). The charge was partially offset by a benefit of $2.5 million to release valuation allowance
on foreign tax credits that were expected to be utilized before they expired.

In March 2005, we repatriated approximately $52.0 million in cash from our non-US subsidiaries.
Also in 2005, we took into account technical corrections issued by the Treasury Department related
to repatriating earnings under the AJCA. As a result of favorable provisions in the technical
corrections, we realized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge
on the repatriated earnings to $1.4 million. In addition, as a consequence of the application of
the technical corrections, we re-evaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and
took a charge of $2.5 million to re-establish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will
more likely than not expire unused.

Excluding the effect of certain one-time charges, the provision for income taxes for calendar years
ended 2005 and 2004 would have been 36.6% and 36.0% respectively. In 2005, the most significant of
these one-time charges included expenses related to the acquisition and integration of META,
various capital losses and impairments, charges associated with the buy-back of under water stock
options, and severance and facilities reduction charges. In 2004, the most significant of these
one-time charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment, the write-off of accumulated foreign
currency translation adjustments associated with certain South American operations, various capital
losses and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges.

2005 SEGMENT RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution
margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, income
taxes, META integration charges, and other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross
contribution as a percentage of revenues.

Research

Research revenues increased 9%, or $42.5 million, when comparing Calendar 2005 and Calendar 2004,
with META contributing approximately $29.0 million, and growth in our Executive Programs accounting
for the majority of the rest of the increase. The impact of foreign currency was immaterial.
Excluding the impact of META and foreign currency, revenue was up 3%.

Research gross contribution of $310.0 million for Calendar 2005 increased from the $292.7 million
for Calendar 2004, while the gross contribution margin for Calendar 2005 decreased to 59% from 61%
in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in Calendar 2005 was primarily due
to increased revenues from our Executive Programs, which have lower margins than our core
subscription products, an increase in compensation costs, mostly due to headcount related to the
META acquisition, and the impact of converting META contract value to Gartner contract value. We
have now transacted on approximately 95% of the META contract value.

Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $592.6 million at December
31, 2005, an increase of 16%, or $83.4 million, from $509.2 million at December 31, 2004.
Approximately half of the increase in contract value is attributable to the META acquisition.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency, contract value increased by approximately 13%. The
research contract value of $592.6 million at December 31, 2005 represents our highest reported
contract value since September 30, 2000.



At December 31, 2005, our research client retention rate increased 1 percentage point to 81% from
80% at December 31, 2004, while our wallet retention rate was 93% compared to 95% at December 31,
2004. Our Executive Program membership was 3,522 at December 31, 2005, up 18% from 2,975 at
December 31, 2004, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as
improved renewal rates and clients obtained as a result of the META acquisition. Our Executive
Program membership remains the largest in our industry and has almost doubled in the last three
years.

Consulting

Consulting revenues of $301.1 million for Calendar 2005 were up 16%, or $41.7 million, when
compared to the $259.4 million in Calendar 2004, with META contributing approximately $18.0 million
of the revenue growth. The revenue increase reflects strong organic growth in our core consulting
services as well as in the performance-fee portion of our consulting business. The increase in the
performance-fee business for Calendar 2005 includes revenues that the Company did not expect to
close until the first quarter of 2006, and as a result our margin for that quarter will be
impacted. The growth in our core consulting services reflects our continuing execution of our
strategy of focusing on fewer accounts, attracting larger deals through integrated solutions, and
enhancing engagement profitability through improved resource management. Revenue in Calendar 2005
increased despite our exit from certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies in
Calendar 2004. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates reduced revenues by approximately 1%.
Excluding the impact of META and foreign currency, revenue was up 11%.

Consulting gross contribution of $125.7 million for Calendar 2005 increased significantly from the
prior year, up 36% from the $92.7 million for Calendar 2004, primarily due to higher profitability
per engagement, as well as the impact of the timing of performance-fees discussed above. Gross
contribution margin for Calendar 2005 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. Consulting
utilization rates were 62% during Calendar 2005 as compared to 63% during Calendar 2004, while our
billable rate was over $350 per hour in Calendar 2005, compared to a $318 per hour billable rate in
Calendar 2004. Our billable headcount increased to 525 at December 31, 2005 as compared to 475 at
December 31, 2004, an 11% increase, primarily related to consultants from the META acquisition.
Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $390,000 in Calendar 2005
compared to $342,000 in Calendar 2004.

Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting,
measurement and SAS, increased 7%, or $8.1 million, to $119.9 million at December 31, 2005,
compared to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004.

Events.

Events revenues increased 9%, or $12.9 million, to $151.3 million for Calendar 2005,
compared to $138.4 million for Calendar 2004, with approximately $2.4 million of the increase
related to META. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on revenues
when comparing Calendar 2005 to Calendar 2004. Excluding META and foreign currency, revenue was up
8%. The revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of events, to 70 for
Calendar 2005 compared to 56 in the prior year period, as we added 15 new events in new topic areas
and geographies. Revenue increased to a lesser extent due to continued performance from our
recurring events, for which revenue was up about 5% year over year. The number of attendees at our
Events increased by about 14% in Calendar 2005 compared to Calendar 2004, rising to 35,502 from
31,223, respectively.

Gross contribution of $76.1 million for Calendar 2005 was 9.6% higher than the $69.5 million
recorded in Calendar 2004. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution was 50% during Calendar
2005 and Calendar 2004. Since new events typically run at lower margins in their first year of
existence, the 15 new events we launched in Calendar 2005 had slightly lower margins than existing
events. However, in addition to launching these new events, we continued to rationalize our
existing portfolio by exiting from events that no longer met our profit targets. As a result of
this active portfolio management, we were able to deliver a flat contribution margin
year-over-year.

CALENDAR 2004 VERSUS CALENDAR 2003

Total revenues increased 4% to $893.8 million during Calendar 2004 from $858.4 million during Calendar 2003.

•

Research

revenues increased 3% in Calendar 2004 to $480.5 million,
compared to $466.9 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately
54% of total revenues in both Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003.

•

Consulting

revenues in Calendar 2004 of $259.4 were up slightly compared
to the $258.6 in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately 29% and 30%
of total revenues in Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $138.4 million in Calendar 2004, an increase of 16%
from the $119.4 million in Calendar 2003, and comprised approximately
15% of total revenues in Calendar 2004 versus 14% in Calendar 2003.

•

Other

revenues, consisting principally of reprint and software licensing
fees, increased 15% to $15.5 million in Calendar 2004 from $13.6 million
in Calendar 2003.

The effects of foreign currency translation had approximately a 3% positive effect on total
revenues for Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Excluding the positive effects of foreign
currency translation, revenues would have increased approximately 1% year-



over-year. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues.

Revenues increased in all regions year-over-year. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian
clients increased 4% to $559.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $535.7 million in Calendar 2003.
Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) increased 4% to
$263.0 million in Calendar 2004 from $252.3 million in Calendar 2003. Revenues from sales to
clients in other international regions increased 1% to $71.4 million in Calendar 2004 from $70.5
million in Calendar 2003.

Cost of services and product development increased 6% during Calendar 2004 to $434.5 million from
$410.7 million during Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, cost
of services and product development would have increased by 2%, primarily due to increased
investment in our core Research business. Growth in our Executive Programs and Events businesses
also contributed to higher costs in Calendar 2004. As a percentage of sales, cost of services and
product development increased to 48.6% from 47.8% in the prior year period. Cost of services and
product development in Calendar 2004 benefited from the reversal of $3.5 million of prior years’
incentive compensation.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%, to $349.8 million during Calendar 2004
from $333.4 million during Calendar 2003. SG&A would have increased by approximately 2% excluding
the negative effects of foreign currency translation. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expense
increased slightly in Calendar 2004, to 39.1% of sales from 38.8% in Calendar 2003. SG&A expenses
benefited during Calendar 2004 from the reversal of $3.3 million of prior years’ incentive
compensation, as well as a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts of $3.7 million due to
increased collections and a decline in bad debt write-offs as a percentage of sales.

Depreciation expense for Calendar 2004 decreased 23% to $27.7 million, compared to $36.0 million
for Calendar 2003. The decrease was due to a reduction in capital spending during Calendar 2004,
Calendar 2003 and Calendar 2002 relative to the capital spending during Fiscal 2001 and 2000, which
led to a decrease in depreciation expense.

Amortization of intangibles decreased 46% when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003 due to
certain intangible assets having been fully amortized since the third quarter of Calendar 2003.

Goodwill impairments were $2.7 million in Calendar 2004 compared to $0 in Calendar 2003, reflecting
the write-off of goodwill related to the closing of certain operations in Latin America and other
non-core product lines.

Other charges during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 were $11.9 million, of which $5.9 million
was for severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction of 40 employees. Other charges of
$4.3 million during the third quarter of Calendar 2004 primarily included severance costs
associated with the departure of our President and our former CEO of $3.1 million and $0.8 million,
respectively. Other charges of $9.1 million during the second quarter of Calendar 2004 included
$3.8 million of severance costs associated with the departure of our former CEO, as well as $5.3
million of costs associated with the termination of 30 employees. During the first quarter of
Calendar 2004, other charges of $10.5 million were primarily associated with a realignment of our
workforce. This workforce realignment was a continuation of the action plan initiated during the
fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 and resulted in the termination of 132 employees, or approximately
4% of our workforce, bringing the total terminations associated with the action plan to 262
employees.

For all of Calendar 2004, we recorded total charges of $29.7 million related to the realignment of
our workforce, including costs of $7.7 million related to the departure of our President and our
former CEO. The realignment resulted in the termination of 203 employees for the full year. The
annualized savings from the termination of these employees would be approximately $23.3 million.
However, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of these savings into improving our products,
processes, infrastructure, and to fund increases in sales capacity to drive future growth.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004, we revised our estimates of previously
recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional
provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases,
as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. We also recorded a charge of $1.9 million
in the fourth quarter of Calendar 2004 related to the abandonment of certain internal systems, and
$1.8 million for charges related to the exit from certain international and other non-core
operations.

Other charges of $29.7 million during Calendar 2003 were for costs for employee severance and
benefits associated with workforce reductions initiated under two separate actions, $5.4 million
during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 and $14.6 million during the fourth quarter of Calendar
2003. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003, we revised our estimates of
previously recorded costs and losses associated with excess facilities and recorded $9.7 million of
additional provisions. The revised estimate was due to a decline in market lease rates for expected
subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated periods of subleases. The workforce reduction that
occurred during the first quarter of Calendar 2003 was a continuation of the action taken in
Transition 2002, which resulted in the termination of 92 employees, or approximately 2% of our
workforce. The purpose of this reduction was to reduce costs in underperforming segments. The
workforce reduction that occurred during the fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 resulted in the
termination of 130 employees, or approximately 3% of our workforce. The purpose of this workforce
reduction was part of an effort to streamline operations, strengthen key consulting practices, and
align our organizational structure to focus on client needs. These remaining payments



associated with the workforce reduction were completed in the second quarter of Calendar 2004 and
were funded out of existing cash.

(Loss) gain on investments, net during Calendar 2004 was a loss of $3.0 million. In the fourth
quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million related to the liquidation of SI I.
In addition, we recorded an additional charge of $0.7 million in related liquidation costs, which
is recorded in Other charges. In the third quarter of Calendar 2004, we recorded a charge of $2.2
million for the transfer of our investment in TruSecure to SI II, as well as a decrease in our
ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points. As a result of this transfer and the
decrease in ownership, we were relieved of all future capital calls, which had totaled $4.0
million. See Note 3 — Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.

(Loss) gain on investments, net during Calendar 2003 was a gain of $4.7 which included a $5.5
million insurance recovery received during Calendar 2003 associated with previously incurred losses
arising from the sale of a business. Also included was an impairment loss of $0.9 million
associated with a minority-owned investment not publicly traded. We evaluated the investment for
impairment because of the investee’s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to
redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity, which led us to write the investment down to our estimate
of fair value.

The conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of Calendar
2003 decreased our interest expense. However, due to the new credit agreement signed in the third
quarter of Calendar 2004, interest expense will increase in the future.

Other (expense), net for Calendar 2004 of $3.9 million includes the non-cash write-off of $3.1
million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our
operations in South America that we have closed. As a result of this decision we were required to
reclassify these currency adjustments that have been accumulated within equity to earnings, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52 “Foreign Currency Translation.”
Other income, net for Calendar 2003 of $0.5 million consists primarily of net foreign exchange
gains.

Provision for income taxes was 51.0% and 33.4% of income before income taxes for Calendar 2004 and
2003, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for Calendar 2004, as compared to that
of Calendar 2003, reflects the impact of a planned repatriation of foreign earnings in Calendar
2005 at a one-time favorable tax rate pursuant to the Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Excluding the effect of certain one-time charges, the provision for income taxes for calendar years
ended 2004 and 2003 would have been 36.0% and 33.0% respectively. In Calendar 2004, the most
significant of these one-time charges included nondeductible goodwill impairment, the write-off of
accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain South American
operations, various capital losses and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges.
In Calendar 2003, the most significant of these one-time charges included various capital losses
and impairments, and severance and facilities reduction charges.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution
margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain selling, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, goodwill impairments, and other
charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.

Research

Research revenues increased 3% when comparing Calendar 2004 and Calendar 2003, but excluding the
favorable effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue was flat.

Research gross contribution of $292.7 million for Calendar 2004 decreased slightly from the $292.9
million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 decreased to 61% from
63% in the prior year. The decrease in the gross contribution margin in Calendar 2004 was primarily
due to increased revenues from our executive programs, which have lower margins than our core
subscription products, as well as continued investment in our people, products, and processes
required to provide Research growth.

Research contract value, an indicator of future research revenue, was $509.2 million at December
31, 2004, an increase of 6% from $482.2 million at December 31, 2003, with roughly half of the
increase due to the effects of foreign currency. The research contract value of $509.2 million at
December 31, 2004 represented our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of
Calendar 2002. During this period, we focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core
Research business. This continued focus began to yield the desired outcome during the latter half
of Calendar 2003. We ended the latter half of 2003 with two consecutive quarters of sequential
increases in contract value after seven consecutive quarters of sequentially decreasing contract
value. Contract value increased sequentially again in the first quarter of Calendar 2004, decreased
slightly during the second quarter of Calendar 2004, and increased sequentially again in both the
third and fourth quarters of Calendar 2004.

At December 31, 2004, our client retention rates increased 2 percentage points to 80% as compared
to the same measure at December 31, 2003. Wallet retention increased 6 percentage points during
Calendar 2004 to 95%. While wallet retention rates held steady or climbed



over the four quarters of Calendar 2004, client retention dipped slightly in the first quarter and
then climbed for the remainder of the year.

Our Executive Program membership was 2,708 at December 31, 2004, up 16% from 2,332 at December 31,
2003, which is attributed to new business growth in North America and EMEA, as well as improved
renewal rates.

Consulting

Consulting revenues of $259.4 for Calendar 2004 were up slightly when compared to the $258.6
million in Calendar 2003. Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, revenues would
have decreased approximately 4% in Calendar 2004 compared to Calendar 2003. Adjusted for currency
effects, Consulting revenue decreased compared to the prior year as a result of our realignment of
our business to exit certain less profitable consulting practices and geographies.

Consulting gross contribution of $92.7 million for Calendar 2004 increased 7% from the $86.8
million for Calendar 2003, while gross contribution margin for Calendar 2004 increased to 36% from
34% in the prior year. The increase in the gross contribution margin was primarily attributable to
higher consultant utilization rates, which were approximately 63% during Calendar 2004 as compared
to approximately 54% during Calendar 2003, as the effects of the realignment were realized, and the
reduction in our billable headcount to 475 at December 31, 2004 as compared to 526 at December 31,
2003, a 10% decrease. Our billable rate was $327.00 per hour in Calendar 2004, a 7% increase from
the $306.00 rate in Calendar 2003, which is due to more efficient use of staff globally and a
higher billable rate in EMEA due to the effects of foreign exchange.

Consulting backlog increased 12% to $111.8 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $99.7 million
at December 31, 2003. Our Consulting business ended Calendar 2004 with the continuation of the
positive trend that began in Calendar 2003, when we ended that year with two consecutive quarters
of sequential increases in backlog after five consecutive quarters of sequential decreases. Due to
the realignment in which we exited certain practices and geographies, consulting backlog decreased
to $91.7 million at March 31, 2004, but increased to $97.7 million at June 30, 2004 and $103.4
million at September 30, 2004, as business ramped up in our areas of focus.

Events

Events revenues increased 16% to $138.4 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $119.4 million for
Calendar 2003. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had approximately a 2% favorable impact
on revenues when comparing Calendar 2004 to Calendar 2003. Revenues increased despite having one
less event during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003, with 56 and 57 events, respectively.
Revenue for Calendar 2004 increased due to higher attendance and higher average exhibitor revenue,
resulting in higher average revenue per event in our recurring events. Attendance at Events
increased to 31,223 in Calendar 2004 from 27,547 in Calendar 2003, a 13% increase, which is
attributed to the popularity of the topics offered.

Gross contribution of $69.5 million for Calendar 2004 was 24% higher than the $56.0 million
recorded in Calendar 2003. As a percentage of revenues, gross contribution increased to 50% during
Calendar 2004 from 47% during Calendar 2003. The increase in gross contribution margin was due to
the mix of events as well as lower personnel and marketing costs. Also, during Calendar 2003, we
invested more in marketing and promoting our events to maintain our attendance levels during a weak
economy, especially in the technology sector.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Calendar 2005

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $27.1 million for Calendar 2005, compared to $48.2
million for the prior year, a $21.1 million decline. The net decrease in cash flow from operating
activities was due primarily to the payment of $35.0 million of META integration payments, higher
employee salary costs, primarily related to higher headcount due to the acquisition of META, and to
a lesser extent, a shift in the mix of our products in the Research segment from higher margin core
research to lower margin Executive Programs. Offsetting these decreases was a $12.0 million
reduction in bonus payments and a decline of approximately $10.0 million in severance and related
payments.

Cash used in investing activities increased to $181.0 million during Calendar 2005 as compared to
$29.0 million in the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of META, which was completed on
April 1, 2005. The Company’s net cash investment in META was approximately $176.4 million of cash
paid, including transaction costs, less the $15.1 million acquired from META. Offsetting the cash
paid for META was a decline in capital expenditures, which decreased $2.7 million for Calendar 2005
as compared to Calendar 2004, and $2.1 million in cash received from the sale of the Company’s
investment in SI II and other investments.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $70.0 million for Calendar 2005, compared to $97.2
million of cash used for Calendar 2004. The increase was primarily driven by the borrowing of
additional debt in Calendar 2005 and cash used in Calendar 2004 for stock repurchases.

We had an additional $56.7 million of debt at December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year end.
During Calendar 2005 we borrowed $327.0 million and we repaid $271.3 million. We borrowed $250.0
million on June 29, 2005 related to the refinancing of our debt by



entering into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as discussed in Note 6 — Debt in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $67.0 million in April under the revolver related to the
META acquisition, and $10.0 million under the revolver which was used to make the second quarter of
Calendar 2005 quarterly payment on the term loan. Of the $271.3 million repaid during Calendar
2005, we paid $247.0 million on June 29, 2005 related to the refinancing, we made $23.4 million in
quarterly debt payments, and we paid $0.9 million for a note payable we acquired in the META
acquisition. We also paid $1.1 million in debt issue costs during the second quarter of Calendar
2005 related to the refinancing of our debt.

We received proceeds from stock issued for stock plans of $31.0 million during Calendar 2005 as
compared to $67.9 million in the prior year as a result of our higher stock price during 2004 as
compared to 2005, which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2004. The Company
used $6.0 million of cash, including expenses, to buy back employee stock options in the third and
fourth quarters of Calendar 2005. In the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005 we used $9.6 million of
cash to repurchase our stock, while in 2004 we used $346.1 million of cash for a stock tender offer
and $6.1 million of cash for treasury stock purchases.

At December 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $70.2 million. The effect of exchange rates
decreased cash and cash equivalents by $6.0 million during Calendar 2005, and was due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and
Sterling.

Calendar 2004

Cash provided by operating activities during Calendar 2004 totaled $48.3 million compared to $136.3
million in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating activities of $88.0 million
was due to several factors. We paid $27.0 million in bonuses during 2004 compared to zero in
Calendar 2003. No bonuses were paid during Calendar 2003 as they had previously been paid during
the quarter ended December 31, 2002 but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a
result of our change in fiscal year that became effective January 1, 2003. As a result, the 2003
bonuses were paid in Calendar 2004. Further, we paid a portion of our 2004 bonuses in the third
quarter of Calendar 2004 in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan. Additionally,
cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately $14.0 million more in
severance during Calendar 2004 than in Calendar 2003. The net decrease in cash flow from operating
activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in Calendar 2003 which
improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately $26.0 million, which was not repeated in
Calendar 2004. Lastly, approximately $15.0 million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the
fourth quarter of Calendar 2003 were paid in the first quarter of Calendar 2004.

Cash used in investing activities increased to $29.0 million during Calendar 2004 as compared to
$25.4 million for Calendar 2003. The increase was primarily due to $3.9 million we prepaid related
to the acquisition of META. Capital expenditures in Calendar 2004 of $25.1 million were 15% lower
than the $28.9 million in Calendar 2003. During Calendar 2003, we received an insurance recovery of
$5.5 million, and we funded $2.0 million of our capital commitment to SI II.

Cash used by financing activities totaled $97.3 million for Calendar 2004, compared to $3.0 million
used in Calendar 2003. We purchased $352.3 million of our common stock for treasury during Calendar
2004, of which $346.2 million represents the tender offer and Silver Lake repurchases, inclusive of
related costs, as compared to $43.4 million during the prior year. We received proceeds from stock
issued for stock plans of $67.8 million during Calendar 2004, as compared to $41.7 million during
the prior year. This increase is a result of higher stock option exercises by our employees as
increases in our stock price caused a significantly larger percentage of our vested stock options
to be in the money during Calendar 2004 as compared to Calendar 2003. We borrowed $200 million
related to the tender in the third quarter of Calendar 2004, receiving proceeds, net of debt
issuance costs, of $197.2 million. We repaid $10.0 million of this debt in the fourth quarter of
Calendar 2004.

At December 31, 2004, cash and cash equivalents totaled $160.1 million. The effect of exchange
rates increased cash and cash equivalents by $8.1 million during Calendar 2004, and was due to the
weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Sterling.

Obligations and Commitments

The Company has a $325.0 million, unsecured five-year Credit Agreement with a bank group led by
JPMorgan Chase Bank consisting of a $200.0 million term loan and a $125.0 million revolving credit
facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to $175.0 million. As of December 31,
2005, there was $196.7 million outstanding on the term loan and $50.0 million outstanding on the
revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $45.6 million
borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.

The term loan will be repaid in 19 quarterly installments, with the final payment due on June 29,
2010. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $15.0 million may be used for
letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until June 29, 2010,
at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The loans bear interest, at the Company’s
option, at a rate equal to the greatest of the Administrative Agent’s prime rate, the
Administrative Agent’s rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for statutory
reserves) and the average rate on overnight federal funds plus


/


of 1% plus a spread equal to
between 0.00% and 0.75%



depending on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended, or at the
Eurodollar rate (adjusted for statutory reserves) plus a spread equal to between 1.00% and 1.75%,
depending on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended.

The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others,
financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and
a minimum annualized contract value ratio and covenants limiting Gartner’s ability to incur
indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, be acquired, dispose of assets, pay dividends,
repurchase stock, make capital expenditures and make investments. Gartner’s obligations under the
credit facility are guaranteed by Gartner’s U.S. subsidiaries. It also contains events of default
that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of
representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross defaults to certain other
indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, and events constituting a
change of control. The occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of
interest by 2.0% and could result in the acceleration of Gartner’s obligations under the Credit
Agreement and an obligation of any or all of the guarantors to pay the full amount of Gartner’s
obligations under the Credit Agreement.

In December 2005 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the base
interest rate risk on the term loan. The effect of the swap is to convert the floating base rate
on the term loan to a fixed rate. Under the swap terms, the Company will pay a 4.885% fixed rate
and in return will receive a three-month LIBOR rate. The three-month LIBOR rate received on the
swap will match the base rate paid on the term loan since both use three-month LIBOR. The swap had
an initial notional value of $200.0 million which will decline as payments are made on the term
loan so that the amount outstanding under the term loan and the notional amount of the swap will
always be equal. The swap had a notional amount of $196.7 million at December 31, 2005, which was
the same as the outstanding amount of the term loan.

In October 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $100.0 million common share
repurchase program. Repurchases under the program will be made from time-to-time through open
market purchases and/or block trades. Repurchases are subject to the availability of our common
stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the Company’s common stock, and our
financial performance. The Company intends to fund the repurchases from cash flow from operations
but may also borrow under the Company’s existing Credit Agreement. During the fourth quarter of
Calendar 2005, the Company repurchased 837,800 shares of its common stock under this program for a
total purchase price of $11.1 million, of which $1.5 million was paid in early January 2006 when
the related share repurchase transactions settled.

We believe that our existing cash balances, together with cash from our operating activities and
the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five-year revolving credit facility, will be
sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term needs.

The following table represents our contractual cash commitments at December 31, 2005 (in millions),
including contractual commitments related to the META acquisition. The table excludes interest
payments under our credit facility:

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In June 2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS No. 154”), which will require
entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change
retrospectively to prior periods’ financial statements, unless this would be impracticable. SFAS
No. 154 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes,” which
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including
in the current period’s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting
principle. SFAS No. 154 also makes a distinction between “retrospective application” of an
accounting principle and the “restatement” of financial statements to reflect the correction of an
error. The statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005.

In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123 and APB
25 and will require the recognition of expense for share-based payments, to include the value of
stock options and other equity awards granted to employees. The revised statement was originally
effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. On April 21,
2005 the SEC issued a standard that amends the date of compliance with SFAS No. 123R (“the SEC
amendment”). Under the SEC amendment, SFAS No. 123R must be adopted beginning with the first
interim or annual reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after June
15, 2005. Gartner adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006,
under the modified prospective method of
adoption.

Projecting the amount of future stock compensation expense is inherently difficult as it is
dependent on the type and amount of future awards granted, and the volatility and price of our
common stock on the date of grant. The Company is currently reviewing its stock compensation
strategy and anticipates that it will make changes to the types of equity awards that it will grant
in the future. Based on our current estimates, we project that the adoption of SFAS 123R will
result in $12.0 million to $14.0 million of pre-tax expense in Calendar 2006, which will have a
materially negative impact on our earnings.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2005, we have exposure to changes in interest rates since we had $246.7 million
outstanding on our unsecured credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, with $196.7 million
outstanding on the term loan and $50.0 million outstanding on the revolver. Under the credit
agreement, the interest rate on our borrowings is LIBOR plus an additional 100 to 150 basis points
based on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio. During the fourth quarter of Calendar 2005 we entered into an
interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base interest rate on the term
loan to a fixed rate. Accordingly, the base interest rate risk on the term loan has been
eliminated, but we are still exposed to interest rate risk on the revolver. However, a 25 basis
point increase or decrease in interest rates would only have an approximate $0.3 million pre-tax
annual effect under the revolver when fully utilized.

Investment
Risk

We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity
investments. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in equity securities totaling $0.3
million (see Note 3 — Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
If there were a 100% adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of December 31, 2005,
this would result in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $0.3 million.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We face two risks related to foreign currency exchange: translation risk and transaction risk.
Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates
in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay
expenses in currencies other than the United States dollar. Since the functional currencies of our
foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries, the foreign
currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not
impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or
lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens against other
currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues
and expenses (as expressed in U.S. dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or
losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included
within Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Currency
transaction gains (losses), net were $(2.8) million, $(3.1) million, and $0.5 million during 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

From time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative
financial instruments to offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. Foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with unrealized and realized
gains and losses recorded in earnings. The following table presents information about our foreign
currency forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2005, expressed in U.S. dollar
equivalents:

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls

Management conducted an evaluation, as of December 31, 2005, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as such term is defined in Rules 13a- 15(e)
and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) under the
supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to
material Company information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the
Act.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Gartner management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. Gartner’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Management’s assessment was reviewed with the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.

Based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded
that, as of December 31, 2005, Gartner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Gartner’s
independent registered public accountants KPMG LLP, have issued an
attestation report on
management’s assessment of Gartner’s internal control of financial reporting. This report appears
on page 34.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended
December 31, 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal controls over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005
and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Gartner, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of,
and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting under Item 9A, that Gartner, Inc. (the “Company”)
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Gartner, Inc. maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Gartner, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

GARTNER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation

. The fiscal year of Gartner, Inc. (the “Company”) represents the period from
January 1 through December 31. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. When used in these notes, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean
Gartner, Inc. and its subsidiaries. During 2005, the Company combined its Class A and Class B
common stock into a single class of common stock. Accordingly, certain share amounts disclosed
herein have been restated to reflect the stock combination.

Principles of consolidation

. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Investments in companies in which the Company owns less than 50% but have the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for
using the equity method. All other investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. The results
of operations for acquisitions of companies accounted for using the purchase method have been
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations beginning on the closing date of acquisition.

Revenues and commission expense recognition

. The Company typically enters into annually renewable
subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and
recognized ratably over the applicable contract terms. The majority of research contracts are
billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All
research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that have
a 30-day cancellation clause but have not produced material cancellations to date. With the
exception of certain government contracts which permit termination and contracts with special
billing terms, it is Company policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as
a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed, which represents a legally enforceable claim,
and a corresponding amount as deferred revenue. For those government contracts that permit
termination, the Company bills the client the full amount billable under the contract but only
records a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, the Company only
records deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenue
attributable to government contracts was $41.7 million and $40.9 million at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had not recognized
receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination of $7.1
million and $4.2 million, respectively, which had been billed but not yet collected. The Company
records the commission obligation related to research contracts upon the signing of the contract
and amortizes the corresponding deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the
related revenues are earned.

Consulting revenues, primarily derived from consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services
(paid one-day analyst engagements), are generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements.
Revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues from
time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided.
Unbilled fees receivables associated with consulting engagements were $31.9 million at December 31,
2005 and $27.9 million at December 31, 2004.

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium,
conference or exhibition. In addition, the Company defers certain costs directly related to events
and expenses these costs in the period during which the related symposium, conference or exhibition
occurs. The Company policy is to defer only those costs, primarily prepaid site and production
services costs, which are incremental and are directly attributable to a specific event. Other
costs of organizing and producing our events, primarily Company personnel and non-event specific
expenses, are expensed in the period incurred. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company
assesses on an event-by-event basis whether expected direct costs of producing a scheduled event
will exceed expected revenues. If such costs are expected to exceed revenues, the Company records
the expected loss in the period determined.

Other revenues includes reprint and software licensing fees and other miscellaneous revenues.
Revenue from reprints is recognized when the reprint has been shipped. Software licensing revenue
is recognized when a signed non-cancelable software license exists, delivery has occurred,
collection is probable, and our fees are fixed or determinable.

Cash and cash equivalents

. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates
fair value based upon their short-term maturity. Investments with maturities of more than three
months are classified as marketable securities.

Investments in equity securities

. The Company accounts for its investments in publicly traded
equity securities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” These investments meet the criteria for
classification as available for sale, given the Company’s ability and intent to sell such
investments, and are recorded at fair value and included in Other assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on these



marketable investments are recorded, net of tax, as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) within the Stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized
gains and losses are recorded in (Loss) gain on investments, net within the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. The cost of equity securities sold is based on specific identification. The Company
assesses the need to record impairment losses on investments and records such losses when the
impairment of an investment is determined to be other than temporary in nature. In making this
assessment, we consider the significance and duration of the decline in value and the valuation of
comparable companies operating in the Internet and technology sectors. The impairment factors we
evaluate may change in subsequent periods, since the entities underlying these investments operate
in a volatile business environment. In addition, these entities may require additional financing to
meet their cash and operational needs; however, there can be no assurance that such funds will be
available to the extent needed at terms acceptable to the entities, if at all. These impairment
losses are reflected in Gain (loss) on investments, net within the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

The Company accounts for investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over using the cost method of accounting. Accordingly, these investments are carried at
the lower of cost or net realizable value and are included in Other assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets (see Note 3 — Investments). The equity method is used to account for investments in
entities that are not majority-owned and that the Company does not control but over which we have
the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements

. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases. Property, equipment and leasehold
improvements, less accumulated depreciation and amortization consist of the following (in
thousands):

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, capitalized development costs for internal use software were $13.2
million and $13.4 million, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $14.0 million and $17.4
million, respectively. Amortization of capitalized internal software development costs totaled $6.7
million, $7.7 million, and $10.6 million during 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, which is
included in Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation expense was
$24.9 million, $26.6 million, and $34.4 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Software development costs

. The Company capitalizes certain computer software development costs and
enhancements, for software sold to customers, after the establishment of technological feasibility,
limited to the net realizable value of the software product, and ceases capitalization when the
software product is available for general release to clients. Until these products reach
technological feasibility, all costs related to development efforts are charged to expense. Once
technological feasibility has been determined, additional costs incurred in development, including
coding, testing, and documentation, are capitalized. Amortization of software development costs is
provided on a product-by-product basis over the estimated economic life of the software, generally
two years, using the straight-line method and is recorded within Depreciation. Amortization of
capitalized computer software development costs begins when the products are available for general
release to customers. Periodic reviews are performed to ensure that unamortized capitalized
software development costs remain recoverable from future revenue. Capitalized software costs, net
of accumulated amortization, were $0.1 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Amortization expense was $0.6 million, $0.9 million, and $1.6 million in 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively. In December 2005 the Company decided to discontinue the sale of internally
created software to customers, the effects of which were immaterial.



Intangible assets

. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their
expected useful lives. Intellectual property and databases are amortized over 18 months, while
customer relationships are amortized over five years. Noncompete agreements are amortized over two
to five years while trademarks are amortized over nine to twelve years. The acquisition of META
resulted in the recording of $25.6 million of intangibles assets, which was composed of $14.4
million of intellectual property, $7.7 million of customer relationships, and $3.5 million of
customer relationships.

Goodwill

. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the
estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired. Under SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
impairment, at least annually, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be an operating
segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management.
Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value,
goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit’s carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units were
estimated using discounted cash flows, market multiples, and other valuation techniques.

The acquisition of META resulted in the recording of $181.2 million of goodwill (see Note 2 —
Acquisition of META). The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the Company’s segments as

In 2004, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $2.7 million in the Consulting segment
related to certain operations in



South America that were closed and for the exit from other non-core operations.

Impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets

. The Company reviews long-lived assets and
intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable. Such evaluation
may be based on a number of factors including current and projected operating results and cash
flows, changes in management’s strategic direction as well as other economic and market variables.
The Company’s policy regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill is to
evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Should events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying value might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows, an
impairment loss would be recognized. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on the
difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate
reflecting the Company’s average cost of funds and the carrying value of the asset (see Note 4 —
Other Charges).

Foreign currency translation

. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss), net within the Stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of a subsidiary are included in results of operations within Other income
(expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Currency transaction gains
(losses), net were $(2.8) million during 2005, $(3.9) million during 2004, and $0.5 million during
2003. The $(3.9) million currency transaction loss in 2004 included a foreign currency charge of
$(3.1) million related to the closing of certain operations in South America.

From time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative
financial instruments to offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. These contracts have a short maturity and are reflected at fair value with unrealized and
realized gains and losses recorded in Other income (expense). During 2005, the net gain (loss) from
these contracts was immaterial. At December 31, 2005, the Company had eleven foreign currency
forward contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of approximately $53.0 million. All of
these contracts expired in January 2006.

Income taxes

. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the
book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. The provision for
income taxes is the sum of the amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by
applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income for that year and the net changes
during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We credit additional paid-in capital for
realized tax benefits arising from stock transactions with employees. The tax benefit on a
nonqualified stock option is equal to the tax effect of the difference between the market price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price.

Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. amounted to approximately $30.0 million
as of December 31, 2005. These earnings have been and will continue to be permanently reinvested.
Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. The
Company did repatriate approximately $52.0 million of foreign earnings in 2005 in order to take
advantage of the beneficial provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). Pursuant
to the AJCA, a tax charge of $5.0 million was included in tax expense for 2004 and a tax benefit of
$3.6 million was included in tax expense for 2005. The net charge of $1.4 million is the Company’s
best estimate of the tax cost related to the dividend repatriation.

Fair value of financial instruments

. The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash
equivalents, fees receivable, accounts payable, and accruals which are short-term in nature. The
carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair value. Investments in
publicly traded equity securities are valued based on quoted market prices. Investments in equity
securities that are not publicly traded are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value,
which approximates fair market value.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $246.7 million of borrowings outstanding. The carrying amount
of these borrowings approximates fair value as the rate of interest on the term loan and revolver
approximates current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable maturities.
In December 2005 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to
the floating base interest rate on the term loan (see Note 6 — Debt). The interest rate swap had a
negative fair value of approximately $0.7 million at December 31, 2005.

Concentrations of credit risk

.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable equity securities and
fees receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to fees receivable are limited due to
the large number of clients comprising the client base and their dispersion across many different
industries and geographic regions.

Use of estimates

. The Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and disclosures, if any, of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Such estimates are required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America in the Company’s preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used



when accounting for such items as allowance for doubtful accounts, investments, depreciation,
amortization, income taxes and certain accrued liabilities.

Accounting for stock-based compensation

. The Company has several stock-based compensation plans.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”) in accounting for our employee stock options and purchase rights and apply
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“SFAS No. 123”) for disclosure purposes only. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method is used to
account for stock-based employee compensation plans. The SFAS No. 123 disclosures include pro forma
net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method of accounting had been used. If
compensation for employee options had been determined based on SFAS No. 123, our pro forma net
(loss) income, and pro forma (loss) income per share would have been as follows (in thousands,
except per share data):

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed its offer to buy back certain vested and
outstanding employee stock options for cash (See Note 8 — Equity and Stock Programs). As a result
of the buy back, approximately $26.2 million of additional pro forma employee stock compensation
expense is included in 2005. The expense results from the reversal of pro forma deferred tax assets
that had been established in prior periods which will not be realized for pro forma purposes
because the options were tendered and cancelled. The pro forma expense had no impact on the
Company’s reported tax expense, recorded deferred tax assets, or actual cash income tax payments.

The fair value of the Company’s stock plans used to compute pro forma net (loss) income and diluted
(loss) income per share disclosures is the estimated fair value at grant date using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were utilized for
stock options granted or modified:

were $2.73, $4.20, and $3.10, respectively.

Recently issued accounting standards

.

On June 1, 2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections

(“SFAS No. 154”), which will require entities that voluntarily make a change
in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods’ financial
statements, unless such application would be impracticable. SFAS No. 154 supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

(“APB 20”), which previously required that most
voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period’s net
income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 also makes a
distinction between “retrospective application” of an accounting principle and the “restatement” of
financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. Another significant change in practice
under SFAS No. 154 will be that if an entity changes its



method of depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived, nonfinancial assets, the change
must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. Under APB 20, such a change would have
been reported as a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to accounting changes and
error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005.

In December 2004 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). This statement replaces SFAS No. 123 and APB
25 and will require the recognition of expense for share-based payments, to include the value of
stock options and other equity awards granted to employees. The revised statement was originally
effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. On April 21,
2005 the SEC issued a standard that amends the date of compliance with SFAS No. 123R (“the SEC
amendment”). Under the SEC amendment, SFAS No. 123R must be adopted beginning with the first
interim or annual reporting period of the registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after June
15, 2005. Gartner adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006, under the prospective method of
adoption.

2—ACQUISITION OF META

On April 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of META for a purchase price of
approximately $168.3 million, excluding transaction costs of approximately $8.1 million. Pursuant
to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of META common stock outstanding at the effective
time of the merger was converted into the right to receive $10.00 in cash. The Company funded the
purchase of META with $67.0 million borrowed under its revolving credit facility and existing cash.

META was an information technology and research firm. The acquisition is intended to accelerate
revenue growth in Gartner’s core research business by increasing sales coverage through the
addition of sales people from META with knowledge of the marketplace and existing client
relationships, increasing the Company’s presence in targeted international markets and providing
greater coverage in several key industries. The acquisition is also intended to achieve cost
synergies in general and administrative expenses.

The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination. The consolidated financial
statements include the results of META from the date of acquisition. The purchase price was
allocated to the net assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the
acquisition date, based on a third party valuation. Any excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, was
allocated to goodwill. A final determination of the purchase price allocation will be made within
one year of the acquisition date.

The following table represents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired
and liabilities assumed (dollars in thousands):

At December 31, 2005, $154.6 million, $20.7 million, and $5.9 million of goodwill were recorded in
the Research, Consulting, and Events segments, respectively, as a result of the META acquisition.
Of the total $181.2 million recorded in goodwill related to META at December 31, 2005, none is
expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
reduced recorded goodwill from the META acquisition by $4.0 million, to $181.2 million from $185.2
million at September 30, 2005. The reduction was due to the recording of a reduction of $3.1
million in accrued facility and other liabilities and a reduction in deferred revenues of $0.9
million. At December 31, 2005, the Company believes that it may still record changes to the
purchase price allocation related to deferred revenues and the recording of liabilities related to
META integration activities under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-3 (see the table below).

Intangible assets recorded on the META acquisition are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated remaining lives. Customer relationships are amortized over five years.
Content represents research that is part of the intellectual property of META and is amortized over
18 months. META databases are used to generate consulting services to specific customers and are
amortized over 18 months.

The preliminary purchase price allocation includes an estimate of the fair value of the cost to
fulfill the deferred revenue obligation assumed from META. The estimated fair value of the deferred
revenue obligation was determined by estimating the costs to provide the services plus a normal
profit margin, and did not include any costs associated with selling efforts. As a result, in
allocating the purchase price, the Company has recorded adjustments to reduce the carrying value of
META’s March 31, 2005 deferred revenue balance by approximately $12.6 million.

In connection with the META acquisition, the Company commenced integration activities that resulted
in the recording of liabilities in purchase accounting under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 95-3,
“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Combination” (“EITF 95-3”), for
involuntary terminations and lease and contract terminations. The liability for involuntary
termination benefits covers 276 employees and through December 31, 2005, almost all of these
employees have been terminated. The Company expects to pay the remaining balance for severance and
benefits by March 31, 2006. The majority of the remaining liabilities for contract terminations
and exit costs should be paid by June 30, 2006, while the lease liabilities will be paid over their
respective contract periods through 2012.

The following table summarizes the initial obligations recorded and activity through December 31,
2005 (dollars in thousands) under EITF 95-3:

(1) During 2005, the Company recorded $2.6 million of additional accruals related to META
obligations under EITF 95-3. The effect of these additional accruals is to increase the amount of
recorded goodwill from the META acquisition.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company booked an additional accrual against goodwill of
approximately $0.1 million related to the identification of an additional tax contingency. During
the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded an additional accrual against goodwill of
approximately $0.4 million related to a contract settlement of a META equipment lease obligation.
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded accruals of approximately $2.1 million
against goodwill for additional severance, the termination of two META contracts, and for various
tax contingencies. The Company recorded $0.7 million of severance related to the identification of
additional benefits that will be paid to severed META employees. In addition, the Company recorded
a $0.4 million accrual related to the termination of a META sales agent relationship, and a $0.5
million accrual was for the termination of an existing agreement with a former



META employee. Under an existing agreement with META, the former employee was entitled to annual
payments for the years 2004 through 2008, which included a percentage of certain META consulting
revenues. In the second quarter of 2005, Gartner negotiated the termination of this agreement,
effective as of April 1, 2005, by agreeing to engage the former employee on an independent
contractor basis through December 31, 2008 and by buying out his right to receive a percentage of
revenues for a lump-sum payment. The tax contingencies accrual of approximately $0.5 million
reflected the Company’s best estimate at that time of taxes due on various META obligations.

(2) During 2005, the Company recorded various adjustments to the estimated META liabilities booked
as of April 1, 2005 that reduced the obligation by $4.1 million. These adjustments were recorded as
more information became available regarding the obligations, permitting the Company to make a
better estimate of the amount of their ultimate settlement, or the obligations were actually
settled in cash for amounts that were different than estimated at the time of the acquisition. The
adjustment of these liabilities resulted in a reduction to the goodwill recorded on the META
acquisition.

Among these adjustments was a fourth quarter 2005 adjustment to reduce accrued lease terminations
by $2.3 million due to higher rental revenue related to faster subleasing of the leases than
originally projected. In addition, the Company reduced accrued severance by approximately $0.5
million based on revised estimates on the amount that would be paid, and reversed a $0.1 million
contract termination accrual after determining that the Company did not have any liability. During
the second quarter of 2005 an adjustment was recorded to reverse a $0.7 million accrual for the
termination of a sales agent relationship that the Company believed would be settled for a lesser
amount.

The following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma financial information for the acquisition
and the related financing as if the acquisition of META had been consummated on January 1, 2005 and
2004 under the purchase method of accounting (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not necessarily represent what would
have occurred if the acquisition had taken place on the dates presented and is not representative
of the Company’s future consolidated results. The future combined Company results will not reflect
the historical combined Company results of both entities. Future research revenues are expected to
be lower on a combined Company basis as a result of expected customer overlap, and future
consulting revenues are expected to be lower on a combined Company basis as a result of exiting
certain practices. In addition, the future general and administrative expenses are expected to be
lower on a combined company basis as a result of the expected cost synergies. The net financial
impact of these matters has not been reflected in the pro forma information. Achievement of any of
the expected cost savings and synergies is subject to risks and uncertainties and no assurance can
be given that such cost savings or synergies will be achieved.

The pro forma information does not include all liabilities that may result from the operation of
META’s business in conjunction with that of Gartner’s following the acquisition and all
adjustments in respect of possible settlements of outstanding liabilities (other than those already
included in the historical financial statements of either company), as these are not presently
estimable. Therefore, the actual amounts ultimately recorded may differ materially from the
information presented in the accompanying pro forma information.

The Company recognizes revenue associated with the fulfillment of the acquired META contracts,
consistent with the Company’s standard revenue recognition methodology, ratably over the contract
term, which is typically twelve months, or upon the completion of the related event. All direct
costs associated with the fulfillment of the acquired META contracts are being expensed over the
period in which the related revenues are recognized. The pro forma information reflects the
Company’s current estimate of the costs required to fulfill the deferred obligation related to the
acquired META contracts.

3—INVESTMENTS

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other
investments had a cost basis and a fair value of $0.3 million which is included in Prepaid expenses
and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million related to this investment. Investments in equity
securities were $7.0 million at December 31, 2004, which is included in Other assets.



During 2005, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $5.1 million and $0.2 million during the
first and second quarters, respectively, primarily related to writedowns of its investment in SI
II, which the Company had decided to sell in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company recorded the
writedown in the first quarter of 2005 to reduce the investment to its estimated net realizable
value after receiving preliminary indications of interest to acquire the investment for less than
its recorded value. The Company took the additional writedown in the second quarter of 2005 based
on a preliminary sale agreement for which the proceeds were less than the recorded value. The
impairment losses are recorded in (Loss) gain from investments, net in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. On August 2, 2005, the Company sold its investment in SI II for approximately $1.3
million, with no resulting gain or loss recorded on the sale since the investment was already at
net realizable value. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company sold an investment in common
stock it had acquired in the META acquisition for $0.7 million, and recorded a loss of $0.5
million, which is recorded in (Loss) gain from investments, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company made the decision to liquidate its equity investments in
SI Venture Associates (“SI I”) and to sell the Company’s interest in SII. SI I and SI II were
venture capital funds engaged in making investments in early to mid-stage IT-based or
Internet-enabled companies, of which the Company owned 100% of SI I and 22% of SI II at December
31, 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million related to
the liquidation of SI I, to include $0.8 million for the writedown of the investment and $0.7
million in related shutdown charges. No charges were recorded on SI II in the fourth quarter of
2004 related to the planned sale since management believed that the carrying value of the
investment approximated its net realizable value. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company
recorded a non-cash charge of $2.2 million related to the transfer of an investment to SI II, as
well as a decrease in the Company’s ownership percentage in SI II of seven hundred basis points.
The carrying value of the Company’s investments held by SI I and SI II were zero and $6.7 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2004. The investment in SI II was not presented separately on the
balance sheet as a held for sale asset as the amount was not material.

During 2003, the Company received proceeds of approximately $5.5 million, recorded as a gain on
investments, on insurance proceeds received associated with a negotiated settlement of a claim
arising from the sale of GartnerLearning in 1998. Also during 2003, the Company recorded an
impairment loss of $0.9 million on a minority-owned investment that was not publicly traded.

4—OTHER CHARGES

During 2005, the Company recorded Other charges of $29.2 million, which included $10.7 million
related to workforce reductions, $6.0 million for an option buyback, $8.2 million primarily due to
a reduction in office space, and approximately $4.3 million of other charges.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $1.5 million for costs
associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits for 27 employees. In
addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005 the Company reversed approximately $0.7 million of
previously accrued severance benefits because the amounts paid were less than accrued. During the
third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded other charges of $6.0 million related to its completion
of a one time offer to buy back certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash (See Note 8
— Equity and Stock Programs). During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded other
charges of $8.2 million. Included in the second quarter charge was $8.2 million of costs primarily
related to the reduction of office space in San Jose, California, by consolidating employees from
two buildings into one. The Company also recorded a charge of $0.6 million associated with certain
stock combination expenses, which was offset by a reversal of $0.9 million of accrued severance and
other charges that the company determined would not be paid. During the first quarter of 2005, the
Company recorded other charges of $14.3 million. Included in the charge was $10.6 million for costs
associated with employee termination severance payments and related benefits. The workforce
reduction was a continuation of the plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2004 which resulted in
the termination of 123 employees during the three months ended March 31, 2005. In addition, during
the first quarter of 2005 the Company also recorded other charges of approximately $3.7 million,
primarily related to a restructuring of the Company’s international operations.

During 2004, the Company recorded Other charges of $35.8 million. Included in this amount was $29.7
million related to severance and benefits for 203 employees, including costs of $7.7 million
related to the departure of our President and COO and our Chairman and CEO. Of the 203 employees,
132 were severed as part of the action plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2003. During 2004
the Company also revised its estimate of previously recorded costs and losses associated with
excess facilities and recorded $2.3 million of additional provisions. The revised estimate was due
to a decline in market lease rates for expected subleases, as well as a reduction in estimated
periods of subleases. The Company also recorded charges in 2004 of $1.9 million related to the
restructuring of certain internal systems, and $1.8 million for charges related to the exit from
certain international and other non-core operations.

In 2003, the Company recorded Other charges of $29.7 million. Of these charges, $20.0 million was
associated with workforce reductions totaling 222 people. In addition, the Company recorded $9.7
million of charges for additional estimated costs and losses associated with excess facilities.

The excess facilities liability as of December 31, 2005 of $20.6 million in the table above does
not include approximately $3.7 million of accrued excess facilities liability as of December 31,
2005 related to interest accreted on the lease liabilities. The interest accreted is charged to
interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the
$20.6 million of excess facilities liability at
December 31, 2005, approximately $14.6 million is
classified in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company expects about $2.7 million of the $3.6 million of workforce reduction costs to be paid
by June 30, 2006, while the majority of the rest will be paid by year-end 2006. The $0.6 million of
asset impairments and other should be paid by June 30, 2006. The Company intends to fund these
payments from existing cash. Costs for excess facilities will be paid as the leases expire, through
2011.

6—DEBT

The Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) on June
29, 2005 that provides for a $325.0 million, unsecured five-year facility with a bank group led by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, consisting of a $200.0 million term loan and a
$125.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to
$175.0 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was $196.7 million outstanding on the term loan and
$50.0 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility.

The Credit Agreement requires the term loan to be repaid in 19 quarterly installments, with the
final payment due on June 29, 2010. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to
$15.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and
reborrowed until June 29, 2010, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The loans bear
interest, at the Company’s option, among several alternatives, and the Company has elected to use
LIBOR plus a margin; the margin consists of a spread between 1.00% and 1.50%, depending on the
Company’s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended. The Company has elected to
use a three-month LIBOR rate for the term loan and a one-month LIBOR rate for the revolver.

The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants, including, among others,
financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and
a minimum annualized contract value ratio and covenants limiting Gartner’s ability to incur
indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, be acquired, dispose of assets, pay dividends,
repurchase stock, make capital expenditures and make investments. Gartner’s obligations under the
credit facility are guaranteed by Gartner’s U.S. subsidiaries. It also contains events of default
that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of
representations and warranties, violation of covenants, cross defaults to certain other
indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, and events constituting a
change of control. The occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of
interest by 2.0% and could result in the acceleration of Gartner’s obligations under the Credit
Agreement and an obligation of any or all of the guarantors to pay the full amount of Gartner’s
obligations under the Credit Agreement.

On February 10, 2006, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment
modified the definition of consolidated fixed charges to allow Gartner to exclude up to $30.0
million spent on share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2005 and full year 2006. The
amendment also increased the letter of credit facility to $15.0 million and now provides for
letters of credit denominated in foreign currencies.

In December 2005 the Company repaid $3.3 million of the term loan in accordance with the Credit
Agreement terms. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $45.6 million borrowing
capacity under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, the interest rates on the
term loan and revolver were 6.03% and 5.89%, respectively, which consist of a three-month LIBOR
base rate and one-month LIBOR base rate, respectively, plus a margin of 1.50% on each.

In December 2005 the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the base
interest rate risk on the term loan. The effect of the swap is to convert the floating base rate
on the term loan to a fixed rate. Under the swap terms, the Company will pay a 4.885% fixed rate
and in return will receive a three-month LIBOR rate. The three-month LIBOR rate received on the
swap will match the base rate paid on the term loan since both use three-month LIBOR. The swap had
an initial notional value of $200.0 million which will decline as payments are made on the term
loan so that the amount outstanding under the term loan and the notional amount of the swap will
always be equal. The swap had a notional amount of $196.7 million at December 31, 2005, which was
the same as the outstanding amount of the term loan.

The Company accounts for the swap as a cash flow hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”). SFAS No. 133 requires all
derivatives, whether designated as hedges or not, to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. Since the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value
of the swap will be recorded in other comprehensive income as long as the swap continues to
effectively hedge the base interest rate risk on the term loan. Any ineffective portion of changes
in the fair value of the hedge will be recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2005, there was no
ineffective portion of the hedge as defined under SFAS No. 133. The interest rate swap had a
negative fair value of $0.7 million at December 31, 2005, which is recorded in other comprehensive
income.

The Company issues letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had outstanding letters of credit of $4.9 million.



7—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases various facilities, furniture and computer equipment under operating lease
arrangements expiring between 2006 and 2025. Future minimum annual payments under non-cancelable
operating lease agreements at December 31, 2005 are as follows (in thousands):

Rental expense for operating leases was $25.0 million in 2005, $25.2 million in 2004, and $25.5
million for 2003. The Company also has commitments for office services, such as printing, copying,
shipping and mail services, which expire in 2006. The minimum obligation under these agreements is
approximately $0.3 million in the aggregate.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed the field work portion of an audit of the
Company’s federal income tax returns for tax years ended September 30, 1999, through 2002. In
October 2005, the Company received an Examination Report indicating proposed changes that primarily
relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation
of payments under a cost sharing arrangement between Gartner Inc. and one of its foreign
subsidiaries. Gartner disagrees with the proposed adjustments relating to valuation and the cost
sharing arrangement and intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable IRS and
judicial procedures, as appropriate. However, if the IRS were to ultimately prevail on the issues,
it could result in additional taxable income for the years under examination of approximately
$130.7 million and an additional federal cash tax liability of approximately $41.0 million. The
Company recorded a provision in prior periods based on its estimate of the amount for which the
claim will be settled, and no additional amount was booked in the current period. Although the
final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain, the Company believes the ultimate
disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, cash flows, or results of operations. The IRS has commenced an examination of tax years 2003 and 2004. There have been
no significant developments to date.

On December 23, 2003, Gartner was sued in an action entitled

Expert Choice, Inc. v. Gartner,
Inc.

, Docket No. 3:03cv02234, United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.
The plaintiff, Expert Choice, Inc., seeks unspecified amount of damages for claims relating to
royalties for the development, licensing, marketing, sale and distribution of certain computer
software and methodologies. The case is currently in the discovery phase. Subsequently, in January
2004, an arbitration demand was filed against Decision Drivers, Inc., one of the Company’s
subsidiaries, and against Gartner, Inc., by Expert Choice. The arbitration demand described the
claim as being in excess of $10.0 million, but did not provide further detail. On February 22,
2006, the Company was informed of an offer from Expert Choice’s counsel to settle the matter for
$35.0 million. The Company immediately rejected Expert Choice’s settlement offer since the Company
believes that is has meritorious defenses against the claims and the Company intends to continue to
vigorously defend the case.

In addition to the matters discussed above, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in
excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a
material effect on our financial position or results of operations when resolved in a future
period.

The Company has various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party with respect
to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in
the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless
against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets
sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights. It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the
conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material. As of December 31,
2005, we did not have any indemnification agreements that would require material payments.

8—EQUITY AND STOCK PROGRAMS

Capital stock

. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be
voted by stockholders. At the Company’s Annual Meeting on June 29, 2005, the Company’s
stockholders approved the combination of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock into a single class of common stock and the elimination of the classification of the
Company’s Board of Directors. Each share of outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock was reclassified into a share of a single class of common stock. Accordingly, certain share
amounts disclosed herein have been restated to reflect the stock combination. The combination had
no impact on the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock and did not increase the total
number of authorized shares of



common stock. A Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State on July 6, 2005 to effectuate these changes. The new common stock retains the Class A Common
Stock’s ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange (IT) and the Class B Common Stock was delisted
from the New York Stock Exchange after the effective date.

The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock. While subject to periodic
review, the current policy of the Board of Directors is to retain all earnings primarily to provide
funds for continued growth. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2005,
contains a negative covenant, which may limit our ability to pay dividends. In addition, our
Amended and Restated Security Holders Agreement with Silver Lake Partners, L.P. requires us to
obtain Silver Lake’s consent prior to declaring or paying dividends.

$100 million share repurchase program.

In October 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
a $100.0 million common share repurchase program. Repurchases under the program will be made from
time-to-time through open market purchases and/or block trades. The Company intends to fund the
repurchases from cash flow from operations but may also borrow under the Company’s existing credit
facility. Repurchases are subject to the availability of our common stock, prevailing market
conditions, the trading price of the Company’s common stock, and our financial performance. During
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 837,800 shares of its common stock under this
program for a total purchase price of $11.1 million, of which $9.6 million was paid in December
2005 and $1.5 million was paid in early January 2006 when the related share purchase transactions
settled.

Stock option buy back.

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed its one-time offer
to buy back certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash, which resulted in the tender and
cancellation of 6,383,445 options. In conjunction with the buyback, the Company recorded a charge
of approximately $6.0 million, including transaction and related costs. The charge is recorded in
Other charges, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Under the offer, option holders were given the opportunity to elect to tender their eligible
options in exchange for a cash payment equal to the value of the outstanding options, as calculated
based on the Black-Scholes valuation model. The offer was made to all current and certain former
employees, except current executive officers and directors, who held options to purchase our common
stock with a strike price greater than $12.94. The accounting for the buyback is governed by APB
25. Under APB 25, the cash consideration paid for redeemed stock options is treated as compensation
expense, which is a charge to earnings. In addition to the expense, APB 25 also requires that those
outstanding options which the Company offered to redeem and which were not tendered are subject to
variable accounting treatment from the day of the offer onward, requiring the Company to take a
potential charge each quarter to the extent the in-the-money value of those options increased as
measured on the last day of the quarter. The Company recorded
immaterial charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 related to the
revaluation of these options. Variable accounting treatment triggered by the option buy back ceased
on January 1, 2006, the date the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R.

Long term incentive plan.

At the Company’s Annual Meeting on June 29, 2005, the Company’s
stockholders approved certain amendments to Gartner’s 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan (“the Plan”),
including an 11 million share increase in the number of shares available under the Plan, the
addition of restricted stock units as an award available for grant under the Plan, and the
extension of the term of the Plan until April 19, 2015, unless sooner terminated by the Company’s
Board of Directors.



Tender Offer.

In the third quarter of 2004 the Company completed a Dutch auction tender offer under
which it repurchased 16.8 million common shares. Additionally, the Company repurchased 9.2 million
common shares from Silver Lake Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (“Silver Lake”). The
total cost of the tender was $346.2 million including transaction costs of $3.8 million.

Terminated $200.0 million share repurchase program.

In July 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors
approved the repurchase of up to $75.0 million of common stock. The Board of Directors subsequently
increased the authorized stock repurchase program to a total authorization for repurchase of $200.0
million. During 2004, the Company repurchased 527,825 shares for a total cost of approximately $6.1
million. On a cumulative basis, the Company repurchased 13,720,397 shares of common stock for a
total cost of $133.2 million under this program. In connection with the 2004 tender offer, the
Board of Directors terminated the stock repurchase program in June 2004.

Conversion of convertible notes.

On April 17, 2000, the Company issued, in a private placement
transaction, $300.0 million of 6% convertible subordinated notes (the “convertible notes”) to
Silver Lake Partners, L.P. (“Silver Lake”) and other noteholders. The convertible notes were
scheduled to mature in April 2005 and had been accruing interest at 6% per annum. Interest had
accrued semi-annually by a corresponding increase in the face amount of the convertible notes
commencing September 15, 2000.

In October 2003, the convertible notes were converted into 49,441,122 shares of Gartner common
stock in accordance with the original terms of the notes. The determination of the number of shares
issued upon conversion was based upon a $7.45 conversion price and a convertible note of $368.3
million, consisting of the original face amount of $300 million plus accrued interest of $68.3
million. The unamortized balances of debt issue costs of $2.8 million and debt discount of $0.3
million as of the conversion date were netted against the outstanding principal and interest
balances, resulting in a $365.2 million increase to stockholders’ equity. Additionally, certain
costs directly associated with the conversion, such as regulatory filing, banking and legal fees,
totaling $0.6 million, were charged to equity.

As part of the original private placement transaction, two Silver Lake representatives were elected
to our ten-member Board of Directors. The Company also granted to Silver Lake the right to acquire
5% of any Company subsidiary that is spun off or spun out at 80% of the initial public offering
price.

9—OPTION PLANS

Stock option plans

.

The Company grants stock options to employees that allow them to purchase
shares of the Company’s common stock. These options are granted as an incentive for employees to
contribute to the Company’s long-term success. Options are also granted to members of the Board of
Directors and certain consultants. Generally, stock options are issued at their fair market value
at the date of grant. Most options vest either a) annually over a three-year service period, or b)
over a four-year vesting period, with 25% vesting at the end of the first year and the remaining
75% vesting monthly over the next three years. Options granted prior to 2005 generally expire ten
years from the grant date, whereas options granted in 2005 generally expire seven years from the
date of grant. At December 31, 2005, 10.9 million shares of common stock were authorized for grants
of options or restricted stock under the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan.

In February 2003, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2003
Plan”) which replaced its 1993 Director Stock Option Plan, 1994 Long Term Option Plan, 1996 Long
Term Stock Option Plan, 1998 Long Term Stock Option Plan and 1999 Stock Option Plan (collectively
the “Previous Plans”). Under the 2003 Plan, 9,928,000 shares of common stock were initially
available for grant. Upon approval of the 2003 Plan, no further grants or awards were allowable
under the Previous Plans. However, any outstanding options or awards under the Previous Plans
remain outstanding until the earlier of their exercise, forfeiture, or expiry date.

A summary of stock option activity under the plans and agreement through December 31, 2005 follows:

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed its offer to buy back certain vested and
outstanding stock options for cash, which resulted in the tender and cancellation of 6,383,445
options. In conjunction with the buyback, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $6.0
million, including transaction and related costs. The charge is recorded in Other charges, net in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Options for the purchase of 10.7 million, 17.8 million, and 23.1 million shares of common stock
were exercisable at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Employee stock purchase plans

. In January 1993, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase
plan, and reserved an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under that plan.
The 1993 plan expired during 2003. In March 2002, shareholders approved the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “2002 Plan”) with substantially identical terms. Eligible employees are
permitted to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an
employee’s compensation (or $21,250 in any calendar year), at a price equal to 95% of the common
stock price as reported by the NYSE at the end of each offering period. Prior to June 1, 2005,
employees could purchase common stock under this program at a price equal to 85% of the common
stock price as reported by the NYSE at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever was
lower. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, 540,083, 443,959, and 544,883 shares were issued from treasury
stock at an average purchase price of $9.22, $9.33, and $7.24 per share, respectively, from these
plans. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had 2.2 million, 2.7 million, and 3.2
million shares, respectively, available for purchase under the 2002 Plan.

Restricted stock awards

.

Beginning in 1998, the Company awarded restricted stock under the 1991
Stock Option Plan and the 1998 Long Term Stock Option Plan. The restricted stock awards generally
vest in six equal installments with the first installment vesting two years after the award and
then annually thereafter for five years. The Company did not make any awards of restricted stock
during 2003. In 2004, the Company made four restricted stock awards, and in 2005 it issued one
replacement award.

The 2004 awards included two awards of restricted stock of 33,000 shares with market values of
$11.96 and $12.78 on the date of grant, respectively, under the 2003 Plan in which the restrictions
lapse over three years. In addition, an additional award of 175,000 shares under the 2003 Plan
(this award was forfeited in 2004), and an inducement award of 500,000 shares to our CEO (discussed
below) were subject to performance-based vesting. Except for the awards with performance-based
vesting, awardees are not required to provide consideration to the Company other than rendering
service. All restricted share awards have the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends.
The employee may not sell the restricted stock that is still subject to vesting. In 1999, the
Company also granted 40,500 stock options with an exercise price of $1.00 per share that vest on
the same basis as the restricted stock awards to certain international employees. Such stock
options had a weighted-average fair market value of $22.81 per stock option on the date of grant.

In the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company announced that its CEO, Eugene A. Hall, had received an
inducement grant of 500,000 shares of restricted stock for which market value on the date of grant
was $12.05 per share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company and Mr. Hall agreed to cancel this
restricted stock award and replace it with a new award for the same amount of shares and on similar
terms. This was done for tax reasons and the number of shares of restricted stock issued to Mr.
Hall remains unchanged. By issuing a new restricted stock award under its stockholder approved 2003
Plan, the Company will be able to take a tax deduction when and if the restrictions lapse on the
restricted stock award. The Company would not have been able to take advantage of this tax
deduction on the 2004 award because the award had been made as an inducement grant, and
consequently was not issued pursuant to a stockholder approved plan. The Company and Mr. Hall have
entered into (i) a Termination of Restricted Stock Agreement to cancel the original award of
500,000 shares



of restricted stock which was made on October 15, 2004; and (ii) a Restricted Stock Agreement which
makes a new grant to him of 500,000 shares of restricted stock under the 2003 Plan.

Similar to the award that was cancelled, the restrictions on this new award lapse as to (i) 300,000
shares when the Company’s common stock trades at an average price of $20 or more for sixty (60)
consecutive trading days, (ii) 100,000 shares when the Company’s common stock trades at an average
price of $25 or more for sixty (60) consecutive trading days, and (iii) 100,000 shares when the
Company’s common stock trades at an average price of $30 or more for sixty (60) consecutive trading
days, subject to Mr. Hall’s continued employment with the Company through each such date.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, all restrictions shall lapse in full upon a change in
control.

On the date Mr. Hall’s restricted stock award was replaced it had a probability-weighted present
value of $4.4 million. The determination of the value of the award was based on the present value
of estimated discounted cash flows, which takes into consideration such factors as the historical
price and volatility of the Company’s common stock, as well as the probability that the Company’s
common stock will reach the target prices. This value is used by the Company for purposes of
calculating the pro forma net income and net income per share in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (see
Footnote 1).

The Company had a total of 530,202 and 602,236 restricted shares of common stock outstanding at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the aggregate unamortized
compensation expense for restricted stock awards and the $1 stock option grants was $6.7 million
and $7.6 million, respectively, which are included in Unearned compensation, net in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total compensation expense recognized for the restricted stock awards
and the stock options granted with an exercise price of $1.00 per share was $0.8 million, $0.9
million, and $0.9 million, in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

10—COMPUTATION OF (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of
securities that could share in earnings. When the exercise of stock options or conversion of
convertible debt is antidilutive they are excluded from the calculation.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the basic and diluted (loss) earnings per
share computations (in thousands, except per share amounts):

In October 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $100.0 million common share
repurchase program. Repurchases under the program will be made from time-to-time through open
market purchases and/or block trades. The Company intends to fund the repurchases from cash flow
from operations but may also borrow under the Company’s existing credit facility. During the fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased 837,800 shares of its common stock under this program for
a total purchase price of $11.1 million.

In the first half of 2004 the Company repurchased 527,825 common shares at an aggregate cost of
$6.1 million under its $200.0 million Stock Repurchase Program. In addition, during the third
quarter of 2004 the Company completed a tender offer in which it repurchased 16,844,508 common
shares at a purchase price of $13.30 and $12.50 per share, respectively. Additionally, the Company
also repurchased 9,228,938 shares from Silver Lake Partners and certain of its affiliates (“Silver
Lake”) at a purchase price of $13.30 per share. The total cost of the tender was $346.2 million
including transaction costs of $3.8 million. In conjunction with the tender offer, the Board of
Directors terminated the $200.0 million Stock Repurchase Program in June 2004.



The following table presents the number of options to purchase shares (in millions) of common stock
that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect would have been
antidilutive. During periods with reported income, these options were antidilutive because their
exercise prices were greater than the average market value of a share of common stock during the
period. During periods with reported loss, all options outstanding had an antidilutive effect.

For 2005, 2004, and 2003, unvested restricted stock awards were not included in the computation of

convertible notes in 2003 were not included in the EPS calculation using the “as if converted”
method because the effect would have been antidilutive.

The following table provides information on the after-tax interest expense that was not added back
to the numerator of the EPS calculation and the weighted average number of shares associated with
the convertible debt that was not included in the denominator of the EPS calculation because the

Current and long-term net deferred tax assets were $11.8 million and $56.6 million as of December
31, 2005, and $13.4 million and $43.1 million as of December 31, 2004, respectively, and are
included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

The valuation allowance relates primarily to state and local and foreign net operating losses,
capital loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits that more likely than not will expire
unutilized. The net increase in valuation allowances of approximately $25.6 million in 2005
relates primarily to establishing a valuation allowances associated with Meta pre-acquisition
assets. These assets include state and local and foreign net operation losses and domestic capital
losses. A portion of the increase also relates to a valuation allowance established for foreign tax
credits and current year capital losses. Approximately $2.3 million of the valuation allowance
will reduce additional paid-in-capital upon subsequent recognition of any related tax benefits
associated with stock options. Approximately $18.9 million of the valuation allowance will reduce
goodwill upon subsequent recognition of any related tax benefits associated with various META
deferred tax assets.

The Company has established full valuation allowances against domestic realized and unrealized
capital losses, as their utilization remains uncertain. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards of $34.4 million. $19.2 million of these capital losses
expired as of December 31, 2005. However, these losses remain subject to utilization against
potential audit adjustments associated with the current IRS exam. $3.6 million of the remaining
capital loss carryovers will expire in 2006, $3.3 million will expire in 2007, and $8.3 million
will expire during 2008 and 2009. The Company also had $84.8 million in state and local capital
loss carryforwards, of which $69.6 million expired as of December 31, 2005. Again, these losses
remain subject to state utilization depending upon adjustments associated with the current IRS
exam. Of the remaining amount, $3.6 million will expire in 2006, $3.3 million will expire in 2007,
and $8.3 million will expire during 2008 and 2009.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had a federal net operating loss carryforward of $18.8
million, the majority of which will expire in 18 years. The Company also had state and local tax
net operating loss carryforwards of $341.5 million, of which $88.7 million will expire within one
to five years, $61.8 million will expire within six to fifteen years, and $191.0 million will
expire within sixteen to twenty years. In addition, the Company had foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of $40.6 million of which $12.3 million will expire in one to eleven years and $28.3
million that can be carried forward indefinitely

As of December 31, 2005 the Company also had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $15.0 million, of
which $9.4 million will expire in 2010, and the remaining will expire in between 2011 and 2015.

In addition, the Company had federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $2.3 million,
which can be carried forward indefinitely and research and development credit carryforwards of
approximately $1.2 million which will expire between 2020 and 2025.

The higher effective tax rate in 2004 as compared to 2003 is primarily attributable to incurring
non-deductible restructuring charges and tax costs from repatriating foreign earnings. These
increases were offset in part by a release of valuation allowance associated with foreign tax
credits. In 2004, we took a $5.0 million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately
$52.0 million in earnings from our non-US subsidiaries in 2005. The repatriation was expected to
qualify for a one-time reduced tax rate pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). The
charge was partially offset by a benefit of $2.5 million to release valuation allowance on foreign
tax credits that were expected to be utilized before they expired.

The increase in the effective tax rate for 2005, as compared to that of 2004, is principally due to
the fact that the Company generated less income in low tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior
year and recorded valuation allowances against capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards.
The impact of these items is offset, in part, by benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense
on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for interest costs related to tax contingencies. The
impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in
2005 as compared to 2004.

The Company also recorded charges in 2005 relating to the acquisition and integration of Meta which
are not deductible for tax purposes. The impact of these items increased tax expense by
approximately $0.7 million or 13.2%

Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. amounted to approximately $30.0 million
as of December 31, 2005. These earnings have been and will continue to be permanently reinvested.
Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. These
earnings could become subject to additional tax if they were distributed in the form of dividends
or otherwise. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that may be payable
on the foreign earnings because of the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

In March 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $52.0 million in cash from its non-US
subsidiaries in order to take advantage of the beneficial provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (AJCA). The Company had previously recorded $5.0 million of tax expense in
anticipation of the repatriation. In 2005, the Company took into account technical corrections
issued by the Treasury Department. As a result of favorable provisions contained in the technical
correction, the Company realized a tax benefit of $3.6 million to reduce the cumulative charge to
$1.4 million. Additionally, as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections, the
Company re-evaluated its ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of $2.5
million to re-establish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that more likely than not will
expire unused.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed the field work portion of an audit of the
Company’s federal income tax returns for tax years ended September 30, 1999, through 2002. In
October 2005, the Company received an Examination Report indicating proposed changes that primarily
relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation
of payments under a cost sharing arrangement between Gartner, Inc. and one of its foreign
subsidiaries. Gartner disagrees with the proposed adjustments relating to valuation and the cost
sharing arrangement and intends to vigorously dispute this matter through applicable IRS and
judicial procedures, as appropriate. However, if the IRS were to ultimately prevail on the issues,
it could result in additional taxable income for the years under examination of approximately
$130.7 million and an additional federal cash tax liability of approximately $41.0 million. The
Company recorded a provision in prior periods based on its estimate of the amount for which the
claim will be settled, and no additional amount was booked in the current period. Although the
final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain, the Company believes the ultimate
disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, cash flows, or results of operations. The IRS has commenced an examination of tax years 2003 and 2004. There have been
no significant developments to date.

12—EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Savings and investment plan.

The Company has a savings and investment plan covering substantially
all domestic employees. Company



contributions are based upon the level of employee contributions. In addition, the Company also
contributes fixed and discretionary profit sharing contributions set by the Board of Directors.
Amounts expensed in connection with the plan totaled $10.6 million, $9.5 million, and $9.3 million,
for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Deferred compensation employee stock trust.

The Company has supplemental deferred compensation
arrangements for the benefit of certain officers, managers and other key employees. These
arrangements are partially funded by life insurance contracts, which have been purchased by the
Company. The plan permits the participants to diversify their investments. The value of the assets
held, managed and invested, pursuant to the agreement was $14.1 million and $13.4 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are included in Other assets. The corresponding
deferred compensation liability of $16.6 million and $15.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, is recorded at fair market value, and is adjusted with a corresponding charge or
credit to compensation cost, to reflect the fair value of the amount owed to the employee and is
included in Other liabilities. Total compensation expense recognized for the plan was $0.2 million,
$0.3 million, and $0.3 million, for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Defined benefit pension plans.

The Company has defined-benefit pension plans in several of its
international locations covering approximately 188 individuals which are accounted for in
accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, -
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS No. 87). Benefits paid under the plans are based on
years of service and employee compensation. None of these plans have plan assets as defined under
SFAS No. 87. The Company’s policy is to account for material defined benefit plans in accordance
with SFAS No. 87.

13—SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company manages its business in three reportable segments: research, consulting and events.
Research consists primarily of subscription-based research products. Consulting consists primarily
of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services. Events consists of various
symposia, conferences and exhibitions.

The Company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross
contribution margin. Gross contribution, as presented below, is defined as operating income
excluding certain cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation,
amortization of intangibles and other charges. The accounting policies used by the reportable
segments are the same as those used by the Company.

We earn revenue from clients in many countries. Other than the United States, there is no
individual country in which revenues from external clients represent 10% or more of the Company’s
consolidated revenues. Additionally, no single client accounted for 10% or more of total revenue
and the loss of a single client, in management’s opinion, would not have a material adverse effect
on revenues.

We do not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by
segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation
of resources.

The following tables present information about the Company’s reportable segments (in thousands).
The “Other” column includes certain revenues and corporate and other expenses (primarily selling,
general and administrative) unallocated to reportable segments, expenses allocated to operations
that do not meet the segment reporting quantitative threshold, and other charges. There are no
intersegment revenues:

The Company’s consolidated revenues are generated primarily through direct sales to clients by
domestic and international sales forces and a network of independent international sales agents.
Revenues in the table below are reported based on where the sale is fulfilled; “Other
International” revenues are those attributable to all areas located outside of the United States
and Canada, as well as Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Most of our products and services are
provided on an integrated worldwide basis. Because of the integration of products and services
delivery, it is not practical to separate precisely our revenues by geographic location. Long-lived
assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets. Accordingly, the separation set forth in the
table below is based upon internal allocations, which involve certain management estimates and
judgments.
