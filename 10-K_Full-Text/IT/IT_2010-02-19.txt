BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT) is the world’s leading information
    technology research and advisory company. Since its founding in
    1979, Gartner has established a leading brand in the IT research
    marketplace. The cornerstones of our strategy are to focus on
    producing extraordinary research content, deliver innovative and
    highly differentiated product offerings, enhance our sales
    capability, provide world class client service, and improve
    operational effectiveness.

We deliver the technology-related insight necessary for our
    clients to make the right decisions, every day. From CIOs and
    senior IT leaders in corporations and government agencies, to
    business leaders in high-tech and telecom enterprises and
    professional services firms, to technology investors, to supply
    chain leaders, and to the front-line professionals in the
    technology organization, we are the indispensable partner to
    60,000 clients in 10,000 distinct organizations in over 80
    countries. We work with every client to research, analyze and
    interpret the business of IT within the context of their
    individual role.

The foundation for all Gartner products and services is our
    independent research on IT issues. The findings from this
    research are delivered through our three customer
    segments — Research, Consulting and Events:

•

Research

provides insight for CIOs, IT
    professionals, technology companies and the investment community
    through reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well
    as peer networking services and membership programs designed
    specifically for CIOs and other senior executives.

•

Consulting

consists primarily of consulting,
    measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid

one-day

analyst engagements) (“SAS”), which provide
    assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused
    on the IT industry.

•

Events

consists of various symposia, conferences
    and exhibitions focused on the IT industry.

Gartner is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A. We
    have 4,305 associates, including almost 1,200 research analysts
    and consultants. For more information regarding Gartner and our
    products and services, visit

MARKET
    OVERVIEW

Today, information technology is critical to the operational and
    financial success of all business enterprises and other
    organizations, as well as government and government agencies.
    Once a support function, IT is now viewed as a strategic
    component of growth and operating performance. Accordingly, it
    has become imperative for executives and IT professionals to
    invest in IT and manage their IT spending and purchasing
    decisions efficiently and effectively.

As the cost of IT solutions continues to rise, executives and
    technology professionals have realized the importance of making
    well-informed decisions and increasingly seek to maximize their
    returns on IT capital investments. As a result, any IT
    investment decision in an enterprise is subject to increased
    financial scrutiny, especially in the current challenging
    economic climate. In addition, today’s IT marketplace is
    dynamic and complex. Technology providers continually introduce
    new products with a wide variety of standards and features that
    are prone to shorter life cycles. Users of
    technology — a group that encompasses nearly all
    organizations — must keep abreast of new developments
    in technology to ensure that their IT systems are reliable,
    efficient and meet both their current and future needs.

Given the critical nature of technology decision making and
    spending, business enterprises, organizations, and governments
    and their agencies are increasingly turning to outside experts
    for guidance in IT procurement, implementation and operations in
    order to maximize the value of their IT investments.
    Accordingly, it is critical that CIOs and other executives and
    personnel within an IT organization obtain value-added,
    independent and objective research and analysis of the IT market
    to assist them in these IT-related decisions.

OUR
    SOLUTION

We provide high-quality, independent and objective research and
    analysis of the IT industry. Through our entire product
    portfolio, our global research team provides thought leadership
    and insight about technology acquisition and deployment to CIOs,
    executives and other technology leaders and professionals.

We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and
    leverages the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital. The
    foundation of our business model is our ability to create and
    distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as
    possible via published reports and briefings, consulting and
    advisory services, and hosting symposia, conferences and
    exhibitions.



With a base of 720 research analysts, we create timely and
    relevant technology-related research. In addition, we have 450
    experienced consultants who combine our objective, independent
    research with a practical, business perspective focused on the
    IT industry. Our events are among the world’s largest of
    their kind, gathering highly qualified audiences of CIOs, senior
    business executives, IT professionals and purchasers and
    providers of IT products and services.

PRODUCTS AND
    SERVICES

Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points
    and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our
    research, consulting and events. A critical part of our
    long-term strategy is to increase business volume with our most
    valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest
    sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering
    strategically relevant research and analysis. We also seek to
    extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client
    relationships, and augment our sales capacity and expand into
    new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase
    our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective
    pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have
    created additional revenue streams through more effective
    packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and
    services.

Our principal products and services are delivered via our
    Research, Consulting and Events segments:

•

RESEARCH.

The Gartner core global research product
    is the fundamental building block for all Gartner services and
    covers all IT markets, topics and industries. We combine our
    proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and
    academic relationships to create Gartner solutions. Our research
    agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the
    critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every
    day. Our research analysts are in regular contact with both
    technology providers and technology users, enabling them to
    identify the most pertinent topics in the IT marketplace and
    develop relevant product enhancements to meet the evolving needs
    of users of our research. Our proprietary research content,
    presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related
    tools, is delivered directly to the client’s desktop via
    our website

and/or

product-specific portals.

Our research analysts provide in-depth analysis on all aspects
    of technology, including hardware; software and systems;
    services; IT management; market data and forecasts; and vertical
    industry issues. Clients typically sign contracts that provide
    access to our research content for individual users over a
    defined period of time. The research contracts are renewed on an
    ongoing basis; despite difficult economic conditions, in 2009 we
    experienced strong research client retention, with 78% of user
    organizations renewing their contracts, as well as 87% wallet
    retention, a measure of the dollar amount of contract value we
    have retained with clients over the prior year.

Our strategy is to align our service and product offerings
    around individual roles within targeted key client groups. For
    example, Gartner Executive Programs (EXP) comprises exclusive
    membership programs designed to help CIOs, senior IT executives
    and other business executives become more effective in their
    enterprises. An EXP membership leverages the knowledge and
    expertise of Gartner in ways that are specific to the CIO’s
    needs and offers role-based offerings and member-only
    communities for peer-based collaboration. Our 3,700 EXP members
    also receive advice and counsel from an executive partner who
    understands their goals and can ensure the most effective level
    of support from Gartner.

Other programs focus on the needs of the IT end-user market and
    IT vendors with a variety of product offerings. Gartner for IT
    Leaders currently provides eight role-based research offerings
    to assist end-user IT leaders with effective decision making.
    These products align a client’s specific job-related
    challenges with appropriate Gartner analysts and insight, and
    connect IT leaders to IT peers who share common business and
    technology issues. Gartner for Enterprise IT Leaders provides a
    personalized service consisting of Gartner research,
    peer-interaction and networking to help senior leaders save time
    and money, mitigate risk and exploit new opportunities. Gartner
    for Business Leaders provides a series of role-based offerings
    to help sales, marketing, product management and professional
    services leaders successfully manage their organizations and
    better interact with Gartner analysts.

Our Industry Advisory Services address technology issues and
    topics with a focus on their impacts on specific vertical
    industries.

Our Best Practices Councils provide peer networks to senior IT
    leaders in large organizations, currently in six practice areas,
    including IT architecture and strategic planning, information
    security, emerging technology management, infrastructure
    management, enterprise applications for SAP and IT sourcing
    management.

Gartner for Technology Investors provides premium research
    focused on the strategies and behaviors of technology end users
    and providers to support the activities of institutional
    investors who invest in technology companies.

•

CONSULTING.

Gartner consultants provide fact-based
    consulting services to help our clients use and manage IT to
    enable business performance. We seek to accomplish three major
    outcomes for our clients: applying IT to drive improvements in
    business performance; creating sustainable IT efficiency that
    ensures a constant return on IT investments; and strengthening
    the



IT organization and operations to ensure high-value services to
    the client’s lines of business and to enable the client to
    adapt to business changes.

We deliver our consulting solutions by capitalizing on Gartner
    assets that are invaluable to IT decision making, including:
    (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our
    consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding
    of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our
    market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our
    client’s success; and (3) our market-leading
    benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons
    and best practices to assess and improve performance.

Gartner Consulting provides solutions aimed at IT roles and IT
    initiatives in various industries. We provide consulting
    engagements to CIO’s and IT executives, and to those
    professionals responsible for IT applications, enterprise
    architecture,

go-to-market

strategies, infrastructure and operations, programs and
    portfolio management and sourcing and vendor relationships, that
    are relevant to the role played by the client within the
    organization. We also provide targeted consulting services to
    professionals in the banking and investment services, education,
    energy and utilities, government, healthcare providers and high
    tech and telecom providers that utilize our in-depth knowledge
    of the demands of each industry. Finally, we provide actionable
    solutions for IT Cost Optimization, Technology Modernization and
    IT Sourcing Optimization initiatives.

•

EVENTS.

Gartner symposia and conferences are
    gatherings of technology’s most senior IT professionals,
    business strategists and practitioners. Symposia and conferences
    give clients live access to insights developed from our latest
    proprietary research in a concentrated way. Informative sessions
    led by Gartner analysts are augmented with technology showcases,
    peer exchange, analyst

one-on-one

meetings, workshops and keynotes by technology’s top
    leaders. Symposia and conferences, which are not limited to
    Gartner research clients, also provide participants with an
    opportunity to interact with business executives from the
    world’s leading technology companies. In 2009, we held 54
    Gartner events throughout the United States, Europe, Latin
    America and the Asia/Pacific region that attracted 30,610
    attendees.

Gartner conferences attract high-level IT and business
    professionals who seek in-depth knowledge about technology
    products and services. Gartner Symposia are large, strategic
    conferences held in various locations throughout the world for
    senior IT and business professionals. Symposia are combined with
    ITxpo, an exhibition where the latest technology products and
    solutions are demonstrated. Gartner Summits focus on specific
    topics, technologies and industries, providing IT Professionals
    with the insight, solutions and networking opportunities to
    succeed in their job role. At the present time we offer Summits
    in Applications, Business Intelligence and Information
    Management, Business Process Improvement, Enterprise
    Architecture, IT Infrastructure and Operations, Portfolio and
    Production Management, Security and Risk Management, and
    Sourcing and Vendor Relationships, among others. Finally, we
    offer targeted events for CIOs and IT executives.

BUSINESS
    DEVELOPMENTS

In December 2009, we acquired AMR Research, Inc. (“AMR
    Research”), which provides information technology research,
    consulting and events for organizations with supply chain
    management issues, thereby expanding the breadth and depth of
    our IT research coverage. Additionally, in the same month, we
    acquired Burton Group, Inc. (“Burton Group”), which
    provides a complementary portfolio of research, consulting and
    events specifically designed to meet the unique needs of
    front-line technology professionals within IT teams. The
    acquisition of Burton Group will enable us to meet the demand of
    our clients and offer a complete solution to every level and
    functional expert within the IT organization. We believe these
    companies will greatly enhance Gartner’s product and
    services offerings.

See Note 2 — Acquisitions in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    regarding these acquisitions.

COMPETITION

We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from
    our competitors are:

•

Superior IT Research Content — We believe that we
    create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research
    coverage of the IT industry. Our research analysis generates
    unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking
    and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality,
    independence and objectivity.

•

Our Leading Brand Name — For over 30 years we
    have been providing critical, trusted insight under the Gartner
    name.

•

Our Global Footprint and Established Customer Base —
    We have a global presence with clients in over 80 countries on
    six continents. Approximately 45% and 47% of our revenues for
    2009 and 2008, respectively, were derived from sales outside of
    the U.S.



•

Substantial Operating Leverage in Our Business Model —
    We have the ability to distribute our intellectual property and
    expertise across multiple platforms, including research
    publications, consulting engagements, conferences and executive
    programs, to derive incremental revenues and profitability.

•

Experienced Management Team — Our management team is
    composed of IT research veterans and experienced industry
    executives.

•

Vast Network of Analysts and Consultants — We have
    almost 1,200 analysts and consultants located around the world.
    Our analysts alone speak 47 languages and are located in
    numerous countries, enabling us to cover all aspects of IT on a
    global basis.

Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face
    competition from a significant number of independent providers
    of information products and services. We compete indirectly
    against consulting firms and other information providers,
    including electronic and print media companies. These indirect
    competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the
    future. Additionally, we face competition from free sources of
    information that are available to our clients through the
    Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in
    which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge
    and existing competitors may start to provide additional or
    complementary services. However, we believe the breadth and
    depth of our research assets position us well versus our
    competition. Increased competition may result in loss of market
    share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced
    pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures.

INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY

Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies,
    software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual
    property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright,
    trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other
    contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property
    rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership
    and the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual
    property, and we also enter into agreements with our employees
    as appropriate that protect our intellectual property.

We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the
    marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it.
    Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract
    compliance by our end users.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2009, we had 4,305 employees, of
    which 691 were located at our headquarters in Stamford,
    Connecticut; 1,945 were located elsewhere in the United States;
    and 1,669 were located outside of the United States. These
    amounts include the addition of 290 new employees as a result of
    the AMR Research and Burton Group acquisitions.

Our employees may be subject to collective bargaining agreements
    at a company or industry level in those foreign countries where
    this is part of the local labor law or practice. We have
    experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with
    our employees to be favorable.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

FACTORS THAT MAY
    AFFECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
    environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties, some
    of which are beyond our control. In addition, we and our clients
    are affected by global economic conditions. The following
    section discusses many, but not all, of these risks and
    uncertainties, but is not intended to be all-inclusive.



Risks related to our
    business

Our operating results could be negatively impacted by general
    economic conditions.

Our business is impacted by
    general economic conditions, both domestic and abroad. The
    global credit crisis and economic downturn that began in 2008
    and continued throughout 2009 could negatively and materially
    affect demand for our products and services. This downturn could
    materially and adversely affect our business, including the
    ability to maintain client retention, wallet retention and
    consulting utilization rates, achieve contract value and
    consulting backlog growth, and attract attendees and exhibitors
    to our events. Such developments could negatively impact our
    financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We face significant competition and our failure to compete
    successfully could materially adversely affect our results of
    operations and financial condition.

We face direct
    competition from a significant number of independent providers
    of information products and services, including information
    available on the Internet free of charge. We also compete
    indirectly against consulting firms and other information
    providers, including electronic and print media companies, some
    of which may have greater financial, information gathering and
    marketing resources than we do. These indirect competitors could
    also choose to compete directly with us in the future. In
    addition, limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in
    which we do business. As a result, additional new competitors
    may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide
    additional or complementary services. Additionally,
    technological advances may provide increased competition from a
    variety of sources.

While we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets
    position us well versus our competition, there can be no
    assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against
    current and future competitors and our failure to do so could
    result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products
    and services, reduced pricing and increased marketing
    expenditures. Furthermore, we may not be successful if we cannot
    compete effectively on quality of research and analysis, timely
    delivery of information, customer service, and the ability to
    offer products to meet changing market needs for information and
    analysis, or price.

We may not be able to maintain our existing products and
    services.

We operate in a rapidly evolving market, and
    our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality and
    timely research and analysis to our clients. Any failure to
    continue to provide credible and reliable information that is
    useful to our clients could have a material adverse effect on
    future business and operating results. Further, if our
    predictions prove to be wrong or are not substantiated by
    appropriate research, our reputation may suffer and demand for
    our products and services may decline. In addition, we must
    continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and
    services in a cost-effective manner. Failure to increase and
    improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely
    affect our future business and operating results.

We may not be able to enhance and develop our existing
    products and services, or introduce the new products and
    services, that are needed to remain competitive.

The
    market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly
    changing needs for information and analysis on the IT industry
    as a whole. The development of new products is a complex and
    time-consuming process. Nonetheless, to maintain our competitive
    position, we must continue to enhance and improve our products
    and services, develop or acquire new products and services,
    deliver all products and services in a timely manner, and
    appropriately position and price new products and services
    relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them. Any
    failure to achieve successful client acceptance of new products
    and services could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial position.
    Additionally, significant delays in new product or services
    releases or significant problems in creating new products or
    services could adversely affect our business, results of
    operations and financial position.

We depend on renewals of subscription-based services and
    sales of new subscription-based services for a significant
    portion of our revenue, and our failure to renew at historical
    rates or generate new sales of such services could lead to a
    decrease in our revenues.

A large portion of our
    success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our
    subscription-based research products and services and new sales
    of such products and services, both to new clients and existing
    clients. These products and services constituted 66% and 60% of
    our revenues for 2009 and 2008, respectively. Generating new
    sales of our subscription-based products and services, both to
    new and existing clients, is often a time consuming process. If
    we are unable to generate new sales, due to competition or other
    factors, our revenues will be adversely affected.

Our research subscription agreements have terms that generally
    range from twelve to thirty months. Our ability to maintain
    contract renewals is subject to numerous factors, including the
    following:

•

delivering high-quality and timely analysis and advice to our
    clients;

•

understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing
    needs of our clients; and

•

delivering products and services of the quality and timeliness
    necessary to withstand competition.



Additionally, as we implement our strategy to realign our
    business to client needs, we may shift the type and pricing of
    our products which may impact client renewal rates. While
    research client retention rate was 78% at December 31, 2009
    and 82% at December 31, 2008, there can be no guarantee
    that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals.

We depend on non-recurring consulting engagements and our
    failure to secure new engagements could lead to a decrease in
    our revenues.

Consulting segment revenues constituted
    25% of our total revenues for 2009 and 27% for 2008. These
    consulting engagements typically are project-based and
    non-recurring. Our ability to replace consulting engagements is
    subject to numerous factors, including the following:

•

delivering consistent, high-quality consulting services to our
    clients;

•

tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our
    clients; and

•

our ability to match the skills and competencies of our
    consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of
    existing or potential consulting engagements.

Any material decline in our ability to replace consulting
    arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and
    our financial condition.

The profitability and success of our conferences, symposia
    and events could be adversely affected by external factors
    beyond our control.

The global credit crisis and
    economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued throughout
    2009 severely impacted travel budgets of all organizations,
    which may continue to negatively impact our business. The market
    for desirable dates and locations for conferences, symposia and
    events is highly competitive. If we cannot secure desirable
    dates and locations for our conferences, symposia and events
    their profitability could suffer, and our financial condition
    and results of operations may be adversely affected. In
    addition, because our events are scheduled in advance and held
    at specific locations, the success of these events can be
    affected by circumstances outside of our control, such as labor
    strikes, transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions,
    economic slowdowns, terrorist attacks, weather, natural
    disasters and other world events impacting the global economy,
    the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the
    success of the event.

Our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and
    may be terminated.

We derive revenues from contracts
    with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and
    their respective agencies, as well as foreign governments and
    their agencies. At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    approximately $182.0 million and $192.0 million,
    respectively, of our Research contract value and Consulting
    backlog was attributable to governments. We believe
    substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at
    December 31, 2009 will be filled in 2010. Our
    U.S. government contracts are subject to the approval of
    appropriations by the U.S. Congress to fund the agencies
    contracting for our services, and our contracts at the state and
    local levels are subject to various government authorizations
    and funding mechanisms. In general, most if not all of these
    contracts may be terminated at any time without cause
    (“termination for convenience”). Should appropriations
    for the governments and agencies that contract with us be
    curtailed, or should government contracts be terminated for
    convenience, we may experience a significant loss of revenue.

We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel
    which could jeopardize the quality of our products and
    services.

Our success depends heavily upon the quality
    of our senior management, research analysts, consultants, sales
    and other key personnel. We face competition for the limited
    pool of these qualified professionals from, among others,
    technology companies, market research firms, consulting firms,
    financial services companies and electronic and print media
    companies, some of which have a greater ability to attract and
    compensate these professionals. Some of the personnel that we
    attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could
    impede our short-term recruitment efforts. Any failure to retain
    key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel
    as required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth
    in our business, could adversely affect the quality of our
    products and services, as well as future business and operating
    results.

We may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand
    name.

We believe that our “Gartner” brand,
    including our independence, is critical to our efforts to
    attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand
    recognition will increase as competition increases. We may
    expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the
    Gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget,
    hire additional marketing and public relations personnel, expend
    additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase
    expenditures to create and maintain client brand loyalty. If we
    fail to effectively promote and maintain the Gartner brand, or
    incur excessive expenses in doing so, our future business and
    operating results could be adversely impacted.

Our international operations expose us to a variety of
    operational risks which could negatively impact our future
    revenue and growth.

We have clients in over 80
    countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from
    international sales. Our operating results are subject to the
    risks inherent in international business activities, including
    general political and economic conditions in each country,
    changes in market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade
    barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign



operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with
    numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between
    U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, and the difficulty of
    enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and
    protecting intellectual property rights in international
    jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on local distributors or
    sales agents in some international locations. If any of these
    arrangements are terminated by our agent or us, we may not be
    able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a
    timely basis, or clients of the local distributor or sales agent
    may not want to continue to do business with us or our new agent.

Our international operations expose us to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates.

Approximately 45% and 47% of
    our revenues for 2009 and 2008, respectively, were derived from
    sales outside of the U.S. Revenues earned outside the
    U.S. are typically transacted in local currencies, which
    may fluctuate significantly against the dollar. While we may use
    forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to
    mitigate foreign currency risk, our revenues and results of
    operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign
    currency fluctuations.

Catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt
    our business.

A disruption or failure of our systems or
    operations in the event of a major weather event, cyber-attack,
    terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays
    in completing sales, providing services, or performing other
    mission-critical functions. Our corporate headquarters is
    located approximately 30 miles from New York City, and we
    have an operations center located in Ft. Myers, Florida, in
    a hurricane-prone area. We also operate in numerous
    international locations. A catastrophic event that results in
    the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or
    information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct
    normal business operations and negatively impact our operating
    results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed
    conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected
    countries, which may increase our operating costs. Additionally,
    these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and
    budget decisions of our clients.

We may experience outages and disruptions of our online
    services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations
    infrastructure.

Our increasing user traffic and
    complexity of our products and services demand more computing
    power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial
    amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade
    our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased
    traffic on our websites. However, any inefficiencies or
    operational failures could diminish the quality of our products,
    services, and user experience, resulting in damage to our
    reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers,
    and advertisers, harming our operating results and financial
    condition.

Our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial
    condition or future operating results.

At
    December 31, 2009, we had $329.0 million outstanding
    under our Credit Agreement, which provides for two amortizing
    term loans with quarterly payments and a $300.0 million
    revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility may be
    increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our
    lenders’ discretion (the “expansion feature”),
    for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million.
    However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may
    not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market
    conditions.

The affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the Credit
    Agreement could limit our future financial flexibility.
    Additionally, a failure to comply with these covenants could
    result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the
    Credit Agreement, which would materially impact our financial
    condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our
    lenders. No assurance can be given that we would be successful
    in doing so in this current financial climate, or that any
    accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms
    as favorable as those presently contained in the Credit
    Agreement.

The associated debt service costs of the borrowing arrangement
    under our Credit Agreement could impair our future operating
    results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or
    additional credit available to us, which could restrain our
    ability to expand or enhance products and services, respond to
    competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities
    requiring substantial investments of additional capital.

We may require additional cash resources which may not be
    available on favorable terms or at all.

We believe that
    our existing cash balances, projected cash flow from operations,
    and the remaining borrowing capacity we have under our revolving
    credit facility will be sufficient for our expected short-term
    and foreseeable long-term operating needs.

We may, however, require additional cash resources due to
    changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy and
    stock repurchase program, to repay indebtedness or to pursue
    future business opportunities requiring substantial investments
    of additional capital. If our existing financial resources are
    insufficient to satisfy our requirements, we may seek additional
    borrowings. Prevailing credit market conditions may negatively
    affect debt availability and cost, and, as a result, financing
    may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if
    at all. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness
    would result in increased debt service obligations and could
    require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that
    would further restrict our operations.

If we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual
    property rights our competitive position may be
    harmed.

We rely on a combination of copyright,
    trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other
    contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property
    rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property
    rights, unauthorized third parties may obtain and



use technology or other information that we regard as
    proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not survive a
    legal challenge to their validity or provide significant
    protection for us. The laws of certain countries do not protect
    our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the
    United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our
    intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying
    or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
    Our employees are subject to non-compete agreements. When the
    non-competition period expires, former employees may compete
    against us. If a former employee chooses to compete against us
    prior to the expiration of the non-competition period, we seek
    to enforce these non-compete provisions but there is no
    assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.

We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions
    and strategic investments, which could involve substantial
    risks.

We have made and may continue to make
    acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that
    offer complementary products and services. The risks involved in
    each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying
    more than the value we derive from the acquisition, dilution of
    the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working
    capital, increased indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed
    liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the ability to
    retain key personnel of the acquired company, the time to train
    the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired
    business, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and
    the distraction of management from our business. The realization
    of any of these risks could adversely affect our business.

We face risks related to litigation.

We are, and may
    in the future be, subject to a variety of legal actions, such as
    employment, breach of contract, intellectual property-related,
    and business torts, including claims of unfair trade practices
    and misappropriation of trade secrets. Given the nature of our
    business, we are also subject to defamation (including libel and
    slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the
    information we publish. Regardless of the merits, responding to
    any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly
    litigation and require us to enter into settlements, royalty and
    licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on
    reasonable terms. If a successful claim is made against us and
    we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms, our business,
    results of operations or financial position could be materially
    adversely affected.

We face risks related to taxation.

We operate in
    numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level
    of operations and profitability in each jurisdiction may have an
    impact upon the amount of income taxes that we recognize in any
    given year. In addition, our tax filings for various tax years
    are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions
    where we conduct business, and in the ordinary course of
    business, we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities
    from time to time.

These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes, and
    resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are
    no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the
    amounts we have recorded. Additionally, the results of an audit
    could have a material effect on our financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which
    that determination is made.

Risks related to our
    common stock

Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and
    may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or
    investors or guidance we have given, which may cause the price
    of our Common Stock to decline.

Our quarterly and
    annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result
    of many factors, including the timing of the execution of
    research contracts, the extent of completion of consulting
    engagements, the timing of symposia and other events, the amount
    of new business generated, the mix of domestic and international
    business, currency fluctuations, changes in market demand for
    our products and services, the timing of the development,
    introduction and marketing of new products and services, and
    competition in the industry. An inability to generate sufficient
    earnings and cash flow, and achieve our forecasts, may impact
    our operating and other activities. The potential fluctuations
    in our operating results could cause

period-to-period

comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may
    provide an unreliable indication of future operating results.
    Furthermore, our operating results may not meet the expectations
    of securities analysts or investors in the future or guidance we
    have given. If this occurs, the price of our stock would likely
    decline.

Our stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to
    resell shares of our Common Stock at or above the price you
    paid.

The trading prices of our Common Stock could be
    subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other
    factors, variations in operating results, developments in the
    industries in which we do business, general economic conditions,
    general market conditions, changes in the nature and composition
    of our stockholder base, changes in securities analysts’
    recommendations regarding our securities and our performance
    relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any
    quarterly period. Such volatility may adversely affect the
    market price of our Common Stock.

Future sales of our Common Stock in the public market could
    lower our stock price.

Sales of a substantial number of
    shares of Common Stock in the public market by our current
    stockholders, or the threat that substantial sales may occur,
    could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decrease
    significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional
    capital by selling stock. Furthermore, we have various equity
    incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock
    options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
    stock units and other stock-based awards. As of
    December 31, 2009, the aggregate number of shares of our
    Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards
    under these plans was approximately 11.5 million shares
    (approximately 5.8 million of which have vested). In
    addition, approximately 7.4 million shares may be issued in
    connection with future



awards under our equity incentive plans. Shares of Common Stock
    issued under these plans are freely transferable without further
    registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
    “Securities Act”), except for any shares held by
    affiliates (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the
    Securities Act). We cannot predict the size of future issuances
    of our Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances
    and sales of shares of our Common Stock will have on the market
    price of our Common Stock.

Interests of certain of our significant stockholders may
    conflict with yours.

As of December 31, 2009,
    ValueAct Capital and affiliates (“ValueAct”) owned
    approximately 21.7% of our Common Stock. To our knowledge, as of
    the date of this report, four other institutional investors each
    presently hold over 5% of our Common Stock. Additionally, a
    representative of ValueAct presently holds one seat on our Board
    of Directors.

While no stockholder or institutional investor individually
    holds a majority of our outstanding shares, these significant
    stockholders may be able, either individually or acting
    together, to exercise significant influence over matters
    requiring stockholder approval, including the election of
    directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation,
    adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of
    significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions,
    consolidations and sales or purchases of assets. In addition, in
    the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third
    party, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a
    change of control in the Company. Accordingly, the interests of
    these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or
    the interests of other stockholders, or otherwise be in the best
    interests of the Company or all stockholders.

Our anti-takeover protections may discourage or prevent a
    change of control, even if a change in control would be
    beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of our
    restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware
    law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us
    in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These
    provisions include:

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the
    terms of preferred stock;

•

advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder
    proposals at stockholder meetings; and

•

the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law.

These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control
    or change in management that might provide stockholders with a
    premium to the market price of their Common Stock.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED
    STAFF COMMENTS.

There are no unresolved written comments that were received from
    the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal
    year relating to our periodic or current reports under the
    Exchange Act.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES.

Our corporate headquarters is located in approximately
    213,000 square feet of leased office space in three
    buildings located in Stamford, Connecticut. Our Stamford
    facility accommodates research and analysis, marketing, sales,
    client support, production, corporate services, executive
    offices, and administration. The lease for the Stamford facility
    expires in October 2010. We have completed negotiations of an
    amendment and 15 year extension of this lease with the
    landlord, and expect to execute the amended lease agreement in
    the first quarter of 2010.

We also have a significant presence in Ft. Myers, Florida
    and Egham, the United Kingdom. Our Ft. Myers location
    consists of approximately 62,400 square feet of leased
    office space located in one building for which the lease expires
    in January 2013. Our Egham location has approximately
    72,000 square feet of leased office space in two buildings
    for which the leases expire in 2020 and 2025, respectively. We
    lease an additional 16 domestic and 40 international locations
    that support our research and analysis, domestic and
    international sales efforts, and other functions. The Company
    does not currently own any properties.

We continue to constantly assess our space needs as our business
    changes, but we believe that our existing facilities are
    adequate for our current needs and that additional space will be
    available as needed.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in
    the ordinary course of business. We believe that the potential
    liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued from all
    proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material
    effect on our financial position or results of operations when
    resolved in a future period.

ITEM 4.

SUBMISSION
    OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

We did not submit any matter to a vote of our stockholders
    during the fourth quarter of the year covered by this Annual
    Report.

Our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on
    June 3, 2010 at the Company’s offices in Stamford,
    Connecticut.

SHARE
    REPURCHASES

The Company has a $250.0 million authorized stock
    repurchase program that was authorized by the Board of Directors
    in February 2008. At the present time, as indicated in the table
    below, approximately $78.6 million remains available for
    share repurchases under this program.

Repurchases are primarily made from

time-to-time

through open market purchases and are subject to the
    availability of stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading
    price of the stock, the Company’s financial performance and
    cash needs, and other conditions. Repurchases may also be made
    from

time-to-time

in connection with the settlement of shared-based compensation
    awards. Repurchases may be funded from cash flow from operations
    and borrowings under the Company’s Credit Agreement. All
    repurchased shares are added to treasury stock. The open market
    purchases were made by brokers pursuant to purchase programs
    that complied with

Rules 10b5-1

and

10b-18

under the Exchange Act.

The following items impact the comparability and presentation of
    our consolidated data:

•

In December 2009 we acquired AMR Research and Burton Group. The
    results of these businesses are included beginning on the
    respective dates of acquisition (see Note 2 —
    Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). For 2009 we recorded approximately
    $2.9 million in pre-tax acquisition and integration charges
    related to these acquisitions.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company eliminated its
    previously reported “Other” revenue line. The
    “Other” revenue line primarily consisted of fees
    earned from Research reprints and other miscellaneous products.
    These revenues are now included with Research revenues (see Note
    1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies in
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

•

We sold our Vision Events business, which had been part of our
    Events segment, in early 2008 and have reported the results of
    operations of this business as a discontinued operation (see
    Note 3 — Discontinued Operations in the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements). The statement of
    operations and per share data for 2005 — 2007 have
    been restated to present the results of the Vision Events
    business as a discontinued operation.

•

We acquired META Group, Inc. on April 1, 2005, and the
    results of that business are included beginning on that date.
    For 2006 and 2005 we recorded $1.5 million and
    $15.0 million, respectively, in pre-tax integration charges
    related to this acquisition.

•

We repurchased 0.3 million, 9.7 million,
    8.4 million, 14.9 million, and 0.8 million of our
    common shares in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

•

We recorded Other charges, which includes costs for severance,
    excess facilities, litigation, and other items, on a pre-tax
    basis, of $9.1 million in 2007 and $29.2 million in
    2005.

•

We recorded pre-tax charges for loss on investments, net of
    $5.8 million in 2005.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS.

The purpose of the following Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis (“MD&A”) is to help facilitate the
    understanding of significant factors influencing the operating
    results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc.
    Additionally, the MD&A also conveys our expectations of the
    potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that
    may impact future results. You should read this discussion in
    conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and
    related notes included in this report. Historical results and
    percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of
    operating results for future periods. References to “the
    Company,” “we,” “our,” and
    “us” are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated
    subsidiaries.

The following items impact the presentation and discussion of
    results in this MD&A section:

On December 18, 2009 we acquired AMR Research, and on
    December 30, 2009 we acquired Burton Group. The financial
    results of these businesses, which were not material to our 2009
    results, have been included in our results beginning on their
    respective dates of acquisition (see Note 2 —
    Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). The operating metrics of these acquired businesses
    have been excluded from our Business Measurements presentations
    and discussions below for comparability purposes.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company reclassified certain
    amounts presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    The Company eliminated its previously reported “Other”
    revenue line. The “Other” revenue line primarily
    consisted of fees earned from Research reprints and other
    miscellaneous products, and these revenues and related expenses
    are now included in the Research segment. In addition, certain
    expenses that were formerly classified in Selling,
    general & administrative are now included in Cost of
    services and product development and are included in Research
    segment expense. Prior periods have been reclassified in order
    to be consistent with the current period presentation. (see
    Note 1 — Business Significant Accounting Policies
    and Note 16 — Segment Information in the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements).

In early 2008 we sold our Vision Events business, which had been
    part of our Events segment. As a result, the results of
    operations for this business for 2008 and earlier periods have
    been reported as a discontinued operation (see
    Note 3 — Discontinued Operations in the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements).

FORWARD-LOOKING

    conferences focused on the IT industry as a whole, as well as IT
    applicable to particular industries and particular roles within
    an organization.

BUSINESS
    MEASUREMENTS

We believe the following business measurements are important
    performance indicators for our business segments:

BUSINESS SEGMENT

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

Research

Contract value

represents the value attributable to all
    of our subscription-related research products that recognize
    revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the
    annualized value of all subscription research contracts in
    effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the
    duration of the contract.

Client retention rate

represents a measure of client
    satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific
    point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage
    basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a
    year ago, by all clients from a year ago.

Wallet retention rate

represents a measure of the amount
    of contract value we have retained with clients over a
    twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a
    percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who
    were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from
    a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign currency
    exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is
    an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or
    increased spending by retained clients, or both.

Number of executive program members

represents the number
    of paid participants in executive programs.

Consulting

Consulting backlog

represents future revenue to be
    derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic
    advisory services engagements.

Utilization rates

represent a measure of productivity of
    our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable
    headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed
    by total hours available to bill.

Billing Rate

represents earned billable revenue divided
    by total billable hours.

Average annualized revenue per billable headcount

represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an
    average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by
    multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the
    utilization percentage times the billable hours available for
    one year.

Events

Number of events

represents the total number of hosted
    events completed during the period.

Number of attendees

represents the number of people who
    attend events.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

We purchased AMR Research and Burton Group in December 2009. We
    believe each of these companies is recognized as

best-in-class

for what they do, and will expand our research market
    opportunity and accelerate our growth rate over time.

We had total revenues of $1,139.8 million in 2009, a
    decline of 11% from the prior year. Revenues decreased in all 3
    of our business segments and all of our geographic regions.
    Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total
    revenues were down about 8% in 2009. We attribute the decline in
    revenue to the global economic downturn that began in 2008.

We had income from continuing operations of $83.0 million
    in 2009, or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to income from
    continuing operations of $97.1 million, or $0.98 per diluted
    share, for 2008. The decline primarily reflects lower
    profitability in our Consulting and Events segments.

Research revenues were down 4%

year-over-year,

to $752.5 million in 2009 from $781.6 million in the
    prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Research
    revenues were down 1%

year-over-year.

Despite the

year-over-year

decline in Research revenues, gross contribution margin
    increased by 2 points, primarily due to the tight cost controls
    we have implemented and to a lesser extent, our ability to
    implement price increases for our products.

As of December 31, 2009, research contract value was
    $784.4 million, client retention was 78%, and wallet
    retention was 87%. Research contract value at December 31,
    2009 was down 6% compared to the prior year end, but adjusted
    for the impact of foreign currency, was down 1%

year-over-year.

While down

year-over-year,

the $784.4 million of contract value at December 31,
    2009 increased 6% from September 30, 2009, reflecting a
    broad-based increase with all industries, geographies, and
    client sizes showing improvement during the quarter.

Consulting revenues declined 17%

year-over-year,

to $286.8 million in 2009 from $347.4 million in 2008,
    primarily due to a decline in core consulting. Excluding the
    unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues
    declined 15%. The Consulting segment contribution margin
    declined 2 points, primarily due to lower revenue in our
    contract optimization business and fewer SAS days filled, which
    have a higher contribution margin than core consulting.
    Utilization in core consulting was 68% for 2009. Backlog was
    $90.9 million at December 31, 2009, a decline of 6%
    from December 31, 2008.

Events revenues decreased 33% in 2009 compared to the prior year
    due to discontinued events and a decline in revenue from our
    on-going events. We discontinued a number of events in 2009 in
    response to the economic downturn, travel restrictions, and
    other



factors. We held 54 events in 2009 compared to 70 in 2008, with
    a 12% decline in attendees at our 51 on-going events. The
    segment contribution margin declined by 2 points

year-over-year,

to 41%.

For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see
    Segment Results below.

During 2009 we continued our focus on enhancing shareholder
    value by reducing our outstanding debt. We repaid
    $95.3 million of our term loans during 2009, which
    represented approximately 32% of the amount outstanding. We also
    used $104.5 million in cash to acquire AMR Research and
    Burton Group.

We had $161.9 million of operating cash flow for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. Our cash and cash equivalents
    totaled $116.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and we
    had approximately $170.0 million of available borrowing
    capacity under our revolving credit facility. We believe that
    our cash position and borrowing capacity is more than adequate
    to meet our existing cash and liquidity requirements.

FLUCTUATIONS IN
    QUARTERLY RESULTS

Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash
    flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the
    timing of our SymposiumITxpo series, that normally are held
    during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount
    of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international
    business; changes in market demand for our products and
    services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the
    development, introduction and marketing of new products and
    services; competition in the industry; and other factors. The
    potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause

period-to-period

comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could
    provide an unreliable indication of future operating results.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires the application
    of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our
    significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in
    the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management
    considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an
    understanding of our financial statements because their
    application requires complex and subjective management judgments
    and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting
    policies are also described below.

The preparation of our financial statements also requires us to
    make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop
    our estimates using both current and historical experience, as
    well as other factors, including the general economic
    environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust
    such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However,
    our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and
    judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition,
    these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in
    time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ from
    actual results. On-going changes in our estimates could be
    material and would be reflected in the Company’s financial
    statements in future periods.

Our critical accounting policies are as follows:

Revenue recognition

– We recognize revenue in
    accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
    Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
    (“SAB 101”), and SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition
    (“SAB 104”). Once all required criteria for
    revenue recognition have been met, revenue by significant source
    is accounted for as follows:

•

Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for
    research products and are deferred and recognized ratably over
    the applicable contract term. Fees from research reprints are
    recognized when the reprint is shipped.

•

Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and
    time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts
    are recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues
    from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is
    delivered

and/or

services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization
    contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon
    satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.

•

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion
    of the related symposium, conference or exhibition.

The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing,
    absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to
    time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and
    non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have
    cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which have not produced
    material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the
    entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee
    receivable at the time the contract is signed with a
    corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract
    represents a legally enforceable claim.

For those government contracts that permit cancellation, we bill
    the client the full amount billable under the contract but only
    record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract.
    In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government
    contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable
    to government contracts were $65.3 million and
    $61.6 million at December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008, respectively. In addition, at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had



not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues
    relating to government contracts that permit termination of
    $8.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Uncollectible fees receivable

– The allowance
    for losses is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales
    reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a
    reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement
    of likely and probable losses and the allowance for losses is
    based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding
    receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and
    the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is
    inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These
    valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as
    more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees
    receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our
    valuation reserves to increase include changes in our
    clients’ liquidity and credit quality, other factors
    negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their
    obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our
    collection efforts.

The following table provides our total fees receivable and the
    related allowance for losses (in thousands):

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible
    assets

– The evaluation of goodwill is performed
    in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, which
    requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least
    annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In
    addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible
    assets is performed on a periodic basis.

Our annual goodwill assessment requires us to estimate the fair
    values of our reporting units based on estimates of future
    business operations and market and economic conditions in
    developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair
    value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we
    must recognize an impairment charge for a portion of the
    associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in
    our financial statements.

Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for
    impairment include the following:

•

Significant under-performance relative to historical or
    projected future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets
    or the strategy for our overall business;

•

Significant negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained
    period; and

•

Our market capitalization relative to net book value.

Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and
    assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and
    the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these
    valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting
    estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional
    information becomes known, we may change our estimates.

We completed the annual goodwill impairment testing in the
    quarter ended September 30, 2009 and concluded that the
    fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units
    substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.

Accounting for income taxes

– As we prepare our
    consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes
    in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process
    involves estimating our current tax expense together with
    assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
    treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These
    differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which
    are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a
    valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when
    future realization is in question. We consider the availability
    of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future
    taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
    strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In
    the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred
    tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount,
    an adjustment is made to reduce the valuation allowance and
    increase income in the period such determination is made.
    Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize
    all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an
    adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income
    in the period such determination is made.

Accounting for stock-based compensation

– The
    Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
    FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletins No. 107
    (“SAB No. 107”) and No. 110
    (“SAB No. 110”). The Company recognizes
    stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair
    value of the award on the date of grant,



over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures
    (see Note 10 — Stock-Based Compensation in the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the
    fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of
    certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the
    expected life of the stock compensation awards and the
    Company’s Common Stock price volatility. In addition,
    determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic
    expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee
    forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain
    performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the
    fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated
    periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but
    these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
    application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the
    Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the
    assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the
    quantity and nature of the Company’s stock-based
    compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need
    to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be
    materially different from what has been recorded in the current
    period.

Restructuring and other accruals

– We may
    record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with
    excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations,
    asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going
    actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition
    certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs
    to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease
    payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and
    severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the
    time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be
    adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates.
    In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in
    business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such
    plans were approved.

We also record accruals during the year for our various employee
    cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each
    reporting period are based on our estimates and may require
    adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are
    sometimes not known with certainty until after year end.

In December 2009 we acquired AMR Research and Burton Group. The
    operating results of these businesses are included in our
    consolidated results beginning on the respective dates of
    acquisition. The results of these businesses were not material
    to our 2009 results.

2009 VERSUS 2008

TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31,
    2009 decreased $139.3 million, or 11%, compared to the
    twelve months ended December 31, 2008. Revenues declined
    across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our
    business



segments. The impact of foreign currency had a negative impact
    on our revenues in 2009, and excluding this impact, total
    revenues in 2009 were down 8% compared to 2008. Our revenues and
    operating results were negatively impacted by global economic
    conditions in 2009.

An overview of our results by geographic region follows:

•

Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients
    decreased 8%, to $663.8 million in 2009 from
    $723.2 million in 2008.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and
    Africa (“EMEA”) decreased to $360.8 million in
    2009 from $430.4 million in 2008, a 16% decrease.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region
    decreased 8%, to $115.2 million in 2009 from
    $125.4 million in 2008.

An overview of our results by segment follows:

•

Research

revenues decreased 4% in 2009 to
    $752.5 million compared to $781.6 million in 2008, and
    comprised approximately 66% and 61% of our total revenues in
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues decreased 17% in 2009 to
    $286.8 million, compared to $347.4 million in 2008,
    and comprised approximately 25% and 27% of our total revenues in
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $100.4 million in 2009, a
    decrease of 33% from $150.1 million in 2008, and comprised
    approximately 9% and 12% of our total revenues in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled
    “Segment Results” for a further discussion of revenues
    and results by segment.

COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT decreased
    $73.8 million

year-over-year,

or 13%. The favorable impact of foreign currency translation
    reduced expense by about $19.0 million. We had lower
    conference expenses of $18.5 million primarily due to
    discontinued events. We also had reduced travel and internal
    meeting charges of $16.7 million and lower personnel costs
    of about $12.5 million, primarily due to our tight cost
    controls. The remaining $7.1 million net decrease was
    spread across a number of other expense categories. Cost of
    services and product development as a percentage of sales
    declined by 1 point, to 44% in 2009 from 45% in 2008, primarily
    due to tight expense controls across our businesses.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”)
    expense decreased by about $38.0 million in 2009, or 7%,
    compared to 2008, despite increasing our sales force. The impact
    of foreign currency translation reduced expense by about
    $18.0 million. We also had lower travel, internal meeting,
    and recruiting costs of about $19.0 million, again due to
    our tight cost controls. The remaining net reduction was spread
    across a number of other expense categories. Excluding the 60
    sales associates that joined us from AMR Research and Burton
    Group, we had 942 quota-bearing sales associates at
    December 31, 2009, a 2% increase from the prior year end.
    This additional investment in sales associates resulted in
    $9.0 million of higher payroll and benefits costs, which
    was offset by lower G&A charges.

DEPRECIATION expense decreased 2%

year-over-year

which reflects reduced capital spending during 2009. Capital
    spending decreased to $15.1 million in 2009 from
    $24.3 million in 2008, a 38% decline, which reflects the
    Company’s reduced 2009 capital expenditures.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million for both 2009
    and 2008.

ACQUISITION AND
    INTEGRATION CHARGES

was $2.9 million in 2009 and
    zero in 2008. Included is these charges are legal fees and
    consultant fees in connection with the acquisitions and
    integration of AMR Research and Burton Group, as well as
    severance costs related to redundant headcount.

OPERATING INCOME decreased 18%

year-over-year,

to $134.5 million in 2009 from $164.4 million in 2008.
    Operating income as a percentage of revenues declined 1 point

year-over-year,

primarily due to lower profitability in our Consulting and
    Events segments and the $2.9 million acquisition and
    integration charge related to AMR Research and Burton Group.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled
    “Segment Results” below for a further discussion of
    revenues and results by segment.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $16.0 million in 2009 and
    $19.3 million in 2008, a 17% decline. The 2009 period
    includes $1.1 million of expense related to the
    discontinuance of hedge accounting on an interest rate swap
    contract (See Note 7 — Debt in the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the
    $1.1 million charge, Interest expense, net would have



declined approximately 22%

year-over-year.

The

year-over-year

decline is primarily attributable to a reduction in the
    weighted-average amount of debt outstanding.

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET of $(2.9) million in 2009
    consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses. The
    $(0.4) million Other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of
    a $1.2 million gain related to the settlement of a
    litigation matter offset by net foreign currency exchange losses.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was
    $32.6 million in 2009 as compared to $47.6 million in
    2008. The effective tax rate was 28.2% in 2009 and 32.9% in
    2008. The lower effective tax rate in 2009 as compared to 2008
    is attributable to several items. The most significant of these
    items include the following: (a) the release of reserves
    for uncertain tax positions relating to the expiration of
    statutes of limitation was larger in 2009 than in 2008 while
    pretax income was lower, and (b) differences relating to
    the taxability of life insurance contracts

year-over-year.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, includes the
    results of the Company’s Vision Events business, which we
    sold in early 2008. The $6.7 million of income for 2008
    includes a net gain on sale of approximately $7.1 million
    and a $(0.4) million operating loss.

NET INCOME was $83.0 million in 2009 and
    $103.9 million in 2008, a decline of $20.9 million or
    20%. The decline was primarily driven by the reduced
    contributions by our three business segments in the 2009 period
    and to a lesser extent, the $2.9 million acquisition and
    integration charge we recorded related to AMR Research and
    Burton Group. These decreases were partially offset by lower
    SG&A charges, a lower effective income tax rate, and
    reduced interest expense. Also contributing to the

year-over-year

decline in net income was the $6.7 million net gain from
    the sale of the Company’s former Vision Events business
    recorded in the 2008 period.

Basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased
    14%

year-over-year.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased
    13%

year-over-year.

2008 VERSUS 2007

TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31,
    2008 increased $110.6 million, or 9%, compared to the
    twelve months ended December 31, 2007. Revenues increased
    across all of our geographic regions and in our Research and
    Consulting segments. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign
    currency translation, total revenues for 2008 would have
    increased 8% over 2007.

An overview of our results by geographic region follows:

•

Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients
    increased 9%, to $723.2 million in 2008 from
    $661.2 million in 2007.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in EMEA increased to
    $430.4 million in 2008 from $403.9 million in 2007, a
    7% increase.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region
    increased 21%, to $125.4 million in 2008 from
    $103.3 million in 2007.

An overview of our results by segment follows:

•

Research

revenues increased 14% in 2008 to
    $781.6 million, compared to $683.4 million in 2007,
    and comprised approximately 61% and 58% of our total revenues in
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues increased 7% in 2008 to
    $347.4 million, compared to $325.0 million in 2007,
    and comprised approximately 27% and 28% of our total revenues in
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $150.1 million in 2008, a
    decrease of 6% from $160.1 million in 2007, and comprised
    approximately 12% and 14% of our total revenues in 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A below entitled
    “Segment Results” for a further discussion of revenues
    and results by segment.

COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased
    $25.6 million

year-over-year,

or 5%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange,
    Cost of service and product development would have increased by
    about 4%.

The

year-over-year

increase was due to several factors. We had $17.0 million
    of higher salary, commissions, and other benefit costs,
    $5.7 million in additional severance and benefits charges
    related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, and
    $4.0 million in additional Events fulfillment costs. The
    impact of foreign currency translation added about
    $2.1 million of expense. Partially offsetting these higher
    charges was a decrease of approximately $3.2 million in
    lower headcount costs, primarily due to our exit from consulting
    operations in Asia-Pacific in mid-2007.



As a percentage of sales, Cost of services and product
    development was 45% and 47% in 2008 and 2007 respectively, a
    decrease of 2 points, which is due to a number of factors. These
    factors include higher revenues coupled with the inherent
    operating leverage in our Research business, improved
    productivity in core Consulting, substantially increased
    revenues in our higher margin contract optimization business in
    our Consulting segment, and a continued focus on expense
    management.

SG&A expense increased by $58.0 million in 2008, or
    13%, compared to 2007. The increase in 2008 expense was
    primarily due to higher investment in our sales organization,
    severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter
    reduction in force, and increases in other payroll and benefits
    costs. Growth in our sales organization resulted in
    approximately $38.0 million of additional payroll and
    benefits, commissions, and travel expense in 2008 when compared
    to 2007. We had 928 quota-bearing sales associates as of
    December 31, 2008, a 15% increase over December 31,
    2007. We had $2.8 million in severance and benefits charges
    related to our fourth quarter 2008 reduction in force, while
    higher payroll and related benefits costs for our other staff
    added about $13.0 million in costs. The remaining increase
    was spread across a number of other cost categories, which was
    offset to some extent by lower recruiting and stock-based
    compensation charges.

DEPRECIATION expense increased 7% in 2008, to $25.9 million
    compared to $24.3 million for the prior year. The increase
    was primarily due to a change in the mix of investment in
    capital expenditures.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million in 2008
    compared to $2.1 million in 2007. The decrease was due to
    certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2007.

OTHER CHARGES was zero in 2008 and $9.1 million in 2007.
    The $9.1 million included charges of $8.7 million
    related to the settlement of litigation and $2.7 million of
    severance costs related to the Company’s exit from
    consulting operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a
    credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility which
    the Company returned to service.

OPERATING INCOME was $164.4 million and $129.5 million
    in 2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of
    $34.9 million, or 27%. Operating income as a percentage of
    revenues was 13% in 2008 and 11% in 2007, a 2 point increase,
    which is due to a number of factors, the most significant being
    the impact from higher revenues in our Research and Consulting
    businesses. The improved operating margin also reflects our
    tight focus on expense management, and charges of
    $9.1 million in 2007 related to the settlement of
    litigation and other items.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled
    “Segment Results” below for a further discussion of
    revenues and results by segment.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $19.3 million and
    $22.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, a decrease of
    $2.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline
    in the weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt.
    The weighted-average interest rate on our debt, including the
    impact of our interest rate swaps, was 4.8% in 2008 and 6.0% in
    2007. The impact of the lower average rate was partially offset
    by an increase in the weighted-average amount of debt
    outstanding of approximately $50.0 million during 2008. In
    2008 we also had about $0.2 million of additional interest
    income, as well as a $0.2 million decrease in the
    amortization of debt issuance costs, both of which are recorded
    in Interest Expense, net.

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $(0.4) million in 2008 and
    $3.2 million in 2007. The $(0.4) million Other expense
    in 2008 primarily consisted of a $1.2 million gain related
    to the settlement of a litigation matter offset by net foreign
    currency exchange losses. The $3.2 million of Other income
    in 2007 primarily consisted of a $1.8 million gain from the
    settlement of a claim and net foreign currency exchange gains.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was
    $47.6 million in 2008 as compared to $39.8 million
    2007. The effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2008 and 36.0% in
    2007. The lower effective tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2007
    was attributable to several items. The most significant of these
    items included the following: (a) the Company generated a
    larger percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2008
    as compared to 2007, and (b) differences relating to the
    tax impact of repatriated funds in 2008 as compared to 2007.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, which
    includes the results of the Company’s Vision Events
    business, was $6.7 million and $2.9 million for 2008
    and 2007, respectively. The Company sold the Vision Events
    business, which had been part of the Company’s Events
    segment, in early 2008. The results for 2008 included a net gain
    on the sale of approximately $7.1 million and a loss from
    operations of $(0.4) million.

NET INCOME was $103.9 million and $73.6 million for
    2008 and 2007, respectively, an increase of $30.3 million,
    or 41%.

Basic earnings per share from continuing operations increased
    $0.34 per share

year-over-year.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased
    $0.33 per share

year-over-year.



SEGMENT
    RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate
    resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution
    is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of
    services and product development charges, and SG&A,
    Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, Amortization
    of intangibles, and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is
    defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues.

We acquired AMR Research on December 18, 2009 and Burton
    Group on December 30, 2009. The financial results of these
    businesses are included in the Financial Measurements beginning
    on their respective dates of acquisition. The results of these
    businesses were not material to our segment results. Business
    Measurements exclude data applicable to these businesses.

2009 VERSUS 2008

Research revenues declined 4%

year-over-year,

but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency
    translation, Research revenues were down about 1%.

In spite of lower revenues, the Research contribution margin
    increased 2 points

year-over-year.

The improved margin was primarily driven by the tight cost
    controls we have implemented, which resulted in lower costs
    concentrated in personnel, travel, and internal meetings, and
    our ability to implement price increases for our products.

Contract value decreased 6% when comparing December 31,
    2009 to December 31, 2008, but excluding the impact of
    foreign currency translation, contract value was down 1%

year-over-year.

While down

year-over-year,

contract value increased $42.0 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2009, or 6%, one of our highest ever quarterly
    increases, with growth across all industries, geographies, and
    client sizes. We believe the increase reflects both improved
    sales effectiveness as well as an improving economic environment.

2008 VERSUS 2007

Revenue in our Research business was up 14% in 2008, to
    $781.6 million. We had growth across our entire product
    portfolio in 2008. Foreign currency translation impact was not
    significant.

Research gross contribution increased to $495.4 million in
    2008 from $419.6 million in 2007, an 18% increase, while
    the contribution margin increased 2 points, to 63% from 61%. The

year-over-year

contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger
    revenue performance coupled with the operating leverage inherent
    in our Research business, along with tight expense management.

Contract value was $834.3 million as of December 31,
    2008, up 11% from $752.5 million at December 31, 2007.
    Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency
    translation, contract value was up approximately 8%.

2009 VERSUS 2008

Consulting revenues declined 17% when comparing 2009 with 2008,
    with the majority of the decline in core consulting, and to a
    lesser extent, in our SAS and contract optimization businesses.
    The decline in core consulting was driven by lower headcount,
    utilization, and billing rates. The decline in revenue in our
    contract optimization business reflects a large contract
    received at the end of 2008 which was not repeated in 2009. SAS
    revenues declined due to approximately 17% fewer fulfilled SAS
    days. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency,
    overall Consulting revenues were down about 15%.

The 2 point decline in the Consulting contribution margin
    reflects lower revenue in our SAS and contract optimization
    businesses, which have higher margins than core consulting. To a
    lesser extent, the decline also reflects lower utilization and
    billing rates in core consulting.

We ended 2009 with 442 billable consultants, a decline of 11%
    from the prior year end as we tightly managed resources to match
    demand. The decline reflects normal attrition as well as the
    termination of approximately 30 consultants in January 2009 to
    better align our delivery resources with lower backlog.

Consulting backlog declined 6%

year-over-year

but increased 7% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2009 to
    $90.9 million, as demand for our consulting services was
    solid in the U.S. while demand in Europe lagged.

2008 VERSUS 2007

Consulting revenues increased

year-over-year

by $22.4 million, or 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of
    foreign currency translation, revenues for 2008 were up about
    6%. The revenue increase was due to strength in both the core
    consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong
    results in our contract optimization business. Contributing to
    the

year-over-year

revenue increase in our contract optimization business was the
    completion of one large contract in the fourth quarter of 2008
    which resulted in approximately $11.0 million of revenue.

Consulting gross contribution increased by $13.1 million
    while the gross contribution margin improved by 2 points. These
    improvements were driven by improved utilization on higher
    headcount and higher billing rates, and higher revenues in our
    contract optimization business, which has a higher margin than
    our core consulting business.

Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be
    recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, was
    $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, compared to
    $121.4 million at December 31, 2007, as bookings
    slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weaker economic
    environment.

2009 VERSUS 2008

Events revenue was down $49.6 million, or 33% in 2009 due
    to the impact of discontinued events and a decline in revenue
    from our on-going events. We held 54 events in 2009, a decline
    of 16 events compared to the prior year. The 54 events held in
    2009 consisted of 51 on-going events and 3 new events. The
    number of attendees at our 51 on-going events was down 12% while
    the number of exhibitors was down 31%. Excluding the unfavorable
    impact of foreign currency, Events revenues were down 32%

year-over-year.

Approximately $24.0 million of the revenue decrease was due
    to 19 discontinued events, including our Spring Symposium, which
    was a significant event in prior years. We discontinued these
    events in 2009 in response to the difficult operating
    environment, with tight travel restrictions and budget cuts at
    many companies due to the weak economy. We also had a
    $30.0 million decline in revenue from our 51 on-going
    events. These declines were slightly offset by approximately
    $4.0 million in higher revenue from new event launches and
    other miscellaneous events revenues. The Events contribution
    margin was down 2 points

year-over-year

primarily due to lower average attendee and exhibitor revenue at
    our 51 on-going events.

While the number of attendees was down significantly

year-over-year,

this trend began to show improvement in the fourth quarter of
    2009 with attendance at our on-going events up 2%. We also began
    to see improvement in exhibitor participation. We believe these
    trends reflect a loosening of corporate travel budgets, resumed
    growth in marketing spend by technology companies, and our
    continuing efforts to increase client retention by enhancing the
    value and experience that our clients derive from our events.

2008 VERSUS 2007

Events revenues decreased 6%

year-over-year,

or $10.0 million, reflecting lower revenues from both
    attendees and exhibitors. Excluding the favorable impact of
    foreign currency translation, events revenues were down
    approximately 7%

year-over-year.

We held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 events in 2007, with
    overall attendance down about 6%, to 41,352 in 2008 from 44,216
    in 2007.

The 70 events held in 2008 included 59 on-going events and 11
    new events. During 2008, the number of exhibitors at our
    on-going events declined by approximately 13%, while attendance
    was 38,961 as compared to 42,554 attendees in 2007, an 8%
    decrease. Average revenue at these on-going events declined
    slightly for attendees but increased slightly for exhibitors.
    Revenues from the 11 new events we held in 2008 was only
    slightly higher than the events we discontinued. The majority of
    the

year-over-year

revenue shortfall occurred in our fourth quarter, as travel
    restrictions, cuts in marketing budgets, and other expense
    controls at many companies took effect in response to the credit
    crisis and weakening global economy.

Events gross contribution was $65.0 million in 2008
    compared to $81.9 million for 2007, while the

year-over-year

gross contribution margin declined by 8 points, to 43% from 51%.
    The decrease in the gross contribution margin was primarily due
    to lower revenues, higher fulfillment costs, the impact of lower
    margin new events, and severance charges related to our
    reduction in force.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from
    our on-going operating activities. As of December 31, 2009,
    we had $116.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and
    $170.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our
    revolving credit facility (not including the $100.0 million
    expansion feature). Our cash and cash equivalents are held in
    numerous locations throughout the world, with approximately 60%
    held outside the United States as of December 31, 2009.



We repaid $95.3 million of our term loans in 2009, thus
    reducing the amount of term loans outstanding by about 32%. We
    paid $104.5 million in cash in December 2009 and
    $13.1 million in January 2010 for the acquisitions of AMR
    Research and Burton Group.

We believe that we have adequate liquidity and that the cash we
    expect to earn from our on-going operating activities, our
    existing cash balances, and the borrowing capacity we have under
    our revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our
    expected short-term and foreseeable long-term operating needs.

The following table summarizes the Company’s changes in
    cash and cash equivalents for the three years ending

2009 VERSUS 2008

Operating

Our operating cash flow decreased by 12% in 2009, or
    $22.4 million. We had a decline of approximately
    $23.0 million in cash from our core operations, along with
    $14.5 million more in cash taxes paid and $8.0 million
    in higher severance payments due to the workforce reduction
    completed in early January 2009. Partially offsetting the
    declines were $14.8 million in lower interest payments on
    our debt, bonus payments, and payments on our excess facilities,
    and an $8.3 million improvement in working capital. The
    improved working capital primarily reflects improved cash
    collection on receivables.

Investing

We used an additional $103.2 million of cash in our
    investing activities in 2009 due to the $104.5 million of
    cash used for the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group.
    We had $15.1 million of capital expenditures in 2009, a
    decline of 38% compared to the $24.3 million of capital
    expenditures in 2008. The decline reflects the Company’s
    tight focus on reducing costs. We also realized
    $7.8 million of cash proceeds in 2008 from the sale of our
    Vision Events business.

Financing

Cash used in financing activities declined by
    $46.1 million, primarily due to a significant decline in
    the use of cash for stock repurchases. Cash used for stock
    repurchases declined by about $197.1 million. Offsetting
    the decline in cash used for share repurchases was an increase
    in the use of cash to repay debt of about $108.7 million
    and a decline in cash proceeds from option exercises and excess
    tax benefits from equity compensation of approximately
    $42.3 million.

2008 VERSUS 2007

Operating

Cash provided by operating activities increased
    $36.1 million, or 24%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The
    increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily
    due to substantially increased cash from our core operations and
    improvement in our working capital, which together added
    approximately $45.0 million in higher operating cash flow.
    Our working capital improved primarily due to improved
    collection of receivables. Also contributing to the improved
    cash flow was $12.0 million in lower cash payments related
    to severance, excess facilities, and settlement of litigation,
    and about $2.0 million less in interest paid on our debt as
    interest rates declined. The improved operating cash flow in
    2008 was somewhat offset by higher cash payments for taxes and
    bonuses of approximately $23.0 million.

Investing

Cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, compared to cash used of
    $24.1 million in 2007. We had capital expenditures of
    $24.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2008,
    which was offset by net cash proceeds from the sale of our
    Vision Events business of approximately $7.8 million. We
    had capital expenditures of $24.2 million in 2007.



Financing

Cash used in financing activities totaled $119.8 million in
    2008 compared to cash used of $93.7 million in 2007, an
    increase in cash used of $26.1 million. The increased use
    of cash was primarily due to a significantly higher use of cash
    for stock repurchases in 2008. We used an additional
    $34.0 million of cash to repurchase our shares in 2008, to
    $200.8 million in 2008 compared to $166.8 million in
    2007. Partially offsetting the additional use of cash used for
    stock repurchases was an increase of $10.2 million in cash
    proceeds from stock issued for stock plans, which rose to
    $44.7 million in 2008 compared to $34.5 million in
    2007, driven by higher option exercises.

OBLIGATIONS AND
    COMMITMENTS

At December 31, 2009, we had $329.0 million
    outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which provides for two
    amortizing term loans and a $300.0 million revolving credit
    facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to
    an additional $100.0 million at our lenders’
    discretion (the “expansion feature”), for a total
    revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. However, the
    $100.0 million expansion feature may or may not be
    available to us depending upon prevailing credit market
    conditions.

The term loans are being repaid in consecutive quarterly
    installments plus a final payment due on January 31, 2012,
    and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our
    option. The revolving loan facility may be borrowed, repaid and
    reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all
    amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 7 —
    Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial
    statements for additional information regarding the Credit
    Agreement.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-6,

Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements

,
    which requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about
    recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including
    significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and
    Level 2 fair-value measurements and information on
    purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in
    the reconciliation of Level 3 fair-value measurements. ASU

2010-6

is
    effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation
    disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning
    after December 15, 2010. We do not expect the adoption of
    ASU

2010-6

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

INTEREST RATE
    RISK

We have exposure to changes in interest rates resulting from the
    $201.0 million outstanding on our two term loans and
    $128.0 million outstanding on our revolver as of
    December 31, 2009. All of these borrowings are floating
    rate, which may be either prime-based or LIBOR-based. Interest
    rates under these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin
    currently between 0.00% and 0.75% on prime borrowings and
    between .625% and 1.75% on LIBOR-based borrowings.

As of December 31, 2009 the annualized interest rates on
    the original term loan, the 2008 term loan, and the revolver
    were 1.0%, 1.26%, and 1.0%, respectively. The rates on the
    original and 2008 term loans consisted of a three-month LIBOR
    base rate plus margins of 0.75% and 1.00%, respectively. The
    rate on the revolver consisted of a one-month LIBOR base rate
    plus a margin of 0.75%.

We have an interest rate swap contract which effectively
    converts the floating base rate on the original term loan to a
    fixed rate. As a result, our exposure to interest rate risk on
    the original term loan is capped. Including the effect of the
    interest rate swap, the annualized interest rate on the original
    term loan was 5.81% as of December 31, 2009.

The Company does not hedge the interest rate risk on the 2008
    term loan and the revolver. Accordingly, we are exposed to
    interest rate risk on this debt. A 25 basis point increase
    or decrease in interest rates would change pre-tax annual
    interest expense on the $300.0 million revolver and the
    $80.0 million outstanding on the 2008 term loan by
    approximately $1.0 million.



FOREIGN CURRENCY
    EXCHANGE RISK

We have clients in over 80 countries and as a result we conduct
    business in numerous currencies other than the U.S dollar. Among
    the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are
    the Euro, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian
    dollar, and the Canadian dollar. Our foreign currency exposure
    results in both translation risk and transaction risk:

TRANSLATION
    RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency translation risk since the
    functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally
    denominated in the local currency. Translation risk arises since
    the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign
    subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the
    exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, and these
    exchange rates fluctuate over time. These foreign currency
    translation adjustments are deferred and are recorded as a
    component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our
    operating results.

A measure of the potential impact of foreign currency
    translation on our Consolidated Balance Sheets can be determined
    through a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents.
    As of December 31, 2009, we had $116.6 million of cash
    and cash equivalents, of which approximately $70.0 million
    was denominated in foreign currencies. If foreign exchange rates
    in comparison to the U.S dollar changed by 10%, the amount of
    cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on
    December 31, 2009 would have increased or decreased by
    approximately $4.0 million.

Our foreign subsidiaries generally operate in a local functional
    currency that differs from the U.S. dollar. Revenues and
    expenses in these foreign currencies translate into higher or
    lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the
    U.S. dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against
    these other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may
    affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in
    U.S. dollars) from foreign operations. Historically, this
    impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since
    foreign currency movements in the major currencies in which we
    operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally.

TRANSACTION
    RISK

We also have foreign exchange transaction risk since we
    typically enter into transactions in the normal course of
    business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ
    from local functional currencies in which the foreign
    subsidiaries operate.

We typically enter into foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts to offset the effects of this foreign currency
    transaction risk. These contracts are normally short term in
    duration. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are
    recognized in earnings. At December 31, 2009, we had 19
    foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a total
    notional amount of $117.3 million and a net unrealized gain
    of approximately $0.7 million. All of these contracts
    matured by the end of January 2010.

CONCENTRATION OF
    CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentration of credit risk consist primarily of short-term,
    highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, and interest rate swap contracts. The
    majority of the Company’s cash equivalent investments and
    its two interest rate swap contracts are with investment grade
    commercial banks that are participants in the Company’s
    Credit Agreement. Accounts receivable balances deemed to be
    collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit
    risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion.

CONTROLS

DISCLOSURE
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management conducted an evaluation, as of December 31,
    2009, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, (as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-

15(e) and

15d-

15(e)
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
    Act”)) under the supervision and with the participation of
    our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based
    upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
    financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
    and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner
    to material Company information required to be disclosed by us
    in reports filed or submitted under the Act.



MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
    REPORTING

Gartner management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f).

Gartner’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In
    addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
    future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
    Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making
    this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Management’s assessment was reviewed with the Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors.

Based on its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting, management has concluded that, as of
    December 31, 2009, Gartner’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of management’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been
    audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered accounting firm,
    as stated in their report which is included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

in Part IV, Item 15.

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit)
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009.
    These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
    of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
    based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 19, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the
    Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit)
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, and
    our report dated February 19, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

GARTNER, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 —
    BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Business.

Gartner, Inc. is a global
    information technology research and advisory company founded in
    1979 with its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Gartner,
    Inc. delivers its principal products and services through three
    business segments: Research, Consulting, and Events.

Basis of presentation.

The fiscal year of
    Gartner, Inc. (the “Company”) represents the period
    from January 1 through December 31. Certain prior year
    amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
    presentation. When used in these notes, the terms
    “Company,” “we,” “us,” or
    “our” mean Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated
    subsidiaries.

On December 18, 2009, we acquired AMR Research, Inc., and
    on December 30, 2009, we acquired Burton Group, Inc. (see
    Note 2 — Acquisitions). The results of these
    businesses are included in our operating results beginning on
    their respective dates of acquisition.

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
    transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Use of estimates.

The preparation of the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions about future events. These estimates and the
    underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and
    liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and
    liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such
    estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable,
    goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, as
    well as tax accruals and other liabilities. In addition,
    estimates are used in revenue recognition, income tax expense,
    performance-based compensation charges, depreciation and
    amortization, and the allowance for losses. Management believes
    its use of estimates in the consolidated financial statements to
    be reasonable.

Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using
    historical experience and other factors, including the general
    economic environment and actions it may take in the future. We
    adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate.
    However, these estimates may involve significant uncertainties
    and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In
    addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a
    point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ
    from actual results.

The global credit crisis and economic downturn that began in
    2008, volatile foreign currency rates, cuts in travel, marketing
    and technology budgets, and other external factors have combined
    to increase the risks and uncertainty inherent in such
    estimates. These external factors may increase the risks the
    Company faces in developing estimates in particular relating to
    the collection of receivables, the achievement of the
    performance targets on performance-based compensation elements,
    and the valuation of goodwill. Changes in those estimates
    resulting from continuing weakness in the economic environment
    or other factors beyond our control could be material and would
    be reflected in the Company’s financial statements in
    future periods.

Reclassifications.

Effective January 1,
    2009, the Company has reclassified certain amounts presented in
    its Consolidated Statements of Operations, as follows:

“Other” revenues

—

The Company
    eliminated its previously reported “Other” revenue
    line. The “Other” revenue line primarily consisted of
    fees earned from Research reprints and other miscellaneous
    products, and these revenues and related expenses are now
    included in the Research segment. The Company made this change
    because the “Other” revenue has declined in magnitude,
    from approximately $10.0 million in 2007, slightly less
    than 1.0% of total revenues in that year, to about
    $8.3 million in 2008, about half a percent of total
    revenues in that year, and this trend is continuing. The revenue
    decline reflects the Company’s decision to discontinue some
    of these products.

Expense reclassifications — Certain expenses that were
    formerly classified as Selling, general &
    administrative expense are now included in Cost of services and
    product development. These reclassifications reflect changes in
    the way we service and deliver value to our Research clients and
    related changes in work responsibilities of certain departments
    and associates.

Prior periods have been reclassified in order to be consistent
    with the current period presentation. See
    Note 16 — Segment Information for additional
    information.

Codification of accounting standards.

On
    September 30, 2009, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 168,

The FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles

(the Codification). The Codification combines the
    previous U.S. GAAP hierarchy which included four levels of
    authoritative accounting literature distributed among a number
    of different sources. The Codification does not by itself create
    new accounting standards but instead reorganizes thousands of
    pages of existing U.S. GAAP accounting rules into
    approximately 90 accounting topics.



All existing accounting standard documents are superseded by the
    Codification and all other accounting literature not included in
    the Codification is now considered non-authoritative. The
    Codification explicitly recognizes the rules and interpretive
    releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) under federal securities laws as authoritative
    GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification is now the single
    source of authoritative nongovernmental accounting standards in
    the United States. As a result of the Codification, the
    references to authoritative accounting pronouncements included
    herein in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

now refer to the Codification topic section rather than a
    specific accounting rule as was past practice.

Subsequent events.

The Company has evaluated
    the potential impact of subsequent events on the consolidated
    financial statements herein through the date of filing of this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Revenues.

Revenues from research products are
    deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract
    term. The Company typically enters into annually renewable
    subscription contracts for research products. Reprint fees are
    recognized when the reprint is shipped.

The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing,
    absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to
    time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and
    non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have
    cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which have not produced
    material cancellations to date. With the exception of certain
    government contracts which permit termination and contracts with
    special billing terms, it is Company policy to record the entire
    amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at
    the time the contract is signed, which represents a legally
    enforceable claim, and a corresponding amount as deferred
    revenue. For those government contracts that permit termination,
    the Company bills the client the full amount billable under the
    contract but only records a receivable equal to the earned
    portion of the contract. In addition, the Company only records
    deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is
    received.

Deferred revenue attributable to government contracts was
    $65.3 million and $61.6 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the Company had not recognized receivables or
    deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit
    termination of $8.3 million and $12.1 million,
    respectively, which had been billed but not yet collected.

Consulting revenues, primarily derived from consulting,
    measurement and strategic advisory services (paid

one-day

analyst engagements), are principally generated from fixed fee
    or time and materials for discrete projects. Revenues for such
    projects are recognized as work is delivered

and/or

services are provided. Unbilled fees receivable associated with
    consulting engagements were $30.0 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $35.3 million at
    December 31, 2008. Revenues related to contract
    optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only
    recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their
    payment.

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion
    of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. In addition,
    the Company defers certain costs directly related to events and
    expenses these costs in the period during which the related
    symposium, conference or exhibition occurs. The Company policy
    is to defer only those costs, primarily prepaid site and
    production services costs, which are incremental and are
    directly attributable to a specific event. Other costs of
    organizing and producing our events, primarily Company personnel
    and non-event specific expenses, are expensed in the period
    incurred. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company
    assesses on an

event-by-event

basis whether expected direct costs of producing a scheduled
    event will exceed expected revenues. If such costs are expected
    to exceed revenues, the Company records the expected loss in the
    period determined.

The Company maintains an allowance for losses which is composed
    of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are
    charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or
    an increase to expense. The amount of the allowance for losses
    is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding
    receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and
    the financial health of specific clients.

Cost of services and product
    development.

Includes costs incurred in the
    creation and delivery of products and services.

Selling, general and administrative
    (“SG&A”).

SG&A expense
    includes direct and indirect selling costs and general and
    administrative costs.

Commission expense.

The Company records the
    commission obligation related to research contracts upon the
    signing of the contract and amortizes the corresponding deferred
    commission expense over the contract period in which the related
    revenues are earned. The Company records commission expense in
    SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Stock-based compensation expense.

The Company
    accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB
    ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletins No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”) and
    No. 110 (“SAB No. 110”). Stock-based
    compensation cost is based on the fair value of the award on the
    date of grant, which is expensed over the related service
    period, net of estimated forfeitures. The service period is the
    period over which the employee performs the related services,



which is normally the same as the vesting period. The Company
    records this expense in both Cost of services and product
    development and SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

During 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recognized
    $26.1 million, $20.7 million, and $24.2 million,
    respectively, of stock-based compensation expense (see
    Note 10 — Stock-Based Compensation).

Income tax expense.

The provision for income
    taxes is the sum of the amount of income tax paid or payable for
    the year as determined by applying the provisions of enacted tax
    laws to taxable income for that year and the net changes during
    the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences
    between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
    presently enacted tax rates. We credit additional paid-in
    capital for realized tax benefits arising from stock
    transactions with employees. The tax benefit on a nonqualified
    stock option is equal to the tax effect of the difference
    between the market price of Common Stock on the date of exercise
    and the exercise price.

Sales taxes.

Sales tax collected from
    customers remitted to governmental authorities is presented on a
    net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Cash and cash equivalents.

All highly liquid
    investments with original maturities of three months or less are
    classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of these
    investments approximates fair value based upon their short-term
    maturity. Investments with maturities of more than three months
    are classified as marketable securities. Interest earned on
    investments is classified in Interest income in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations.

Property, equipment and leasehold
    improvements.

The Company leases all of its
    facilities and certain equipment. These leases are all
    classified as operating leases in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
    840. The cost of these operating leases, including any
    contractual rent concessions, contractual rent increases, and
    landlord incentives, are recognized ratably over the life of the
    related lease agreement. Lease expense was $22.5 million in
    both 2009 and 2008 and $23.8 million in 2007.

Equipment, leasehold improvements, and other fixed assets owned
    by the Company are recorded at cost less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization and are depreciated using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
    straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
    lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases.
    Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization consist of the following (in

The Company also capitalizes certain development costs incurred
    to develop internal use software in accordance with FASB ASC
    Topic 350. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, capitalized
    development costs for internal use software were
    $16.1 million and $19.6 million, respectively, net of
    accumulated amortization of $20.4 million and
    $18.9 million, respectively. Amortization of capitalized
    internal software development costs, which is classified in
    Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations,
    totaled $8.3 million, $7.4 million, and
    $6.5 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

The Company had total depreciation expense of
    $25.4 million, $25.9 million, and $24.3 million

Goodwill.

Goodwill represents the excess of
    the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated
    fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net
    assets acquired. The evaluation of goodwill is performed in
    accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, which requires an annual
    assessment of potential goodwill impairment at the reporting
    unit level. A reporting unit can be an operating segment or a
    business if discrete financial information is prepared and
    reviewed by management. Under the impairment test, if a
    reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair
    value, goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the
    reporting unit’s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the
    implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting
    units is estimated using discounted cash flows, market
    multiples, and other valuation techniques.

The following table presents changes to the carrying amount of
    goodwill by reporting segment during the two years ended

Impairment of long-lived assets and intangible
    assets.

The Company reviews long-lived assets and
    intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable. Such
    evaluation may be based on a number of factors including current
    and projected operating results and cash flows, changes in
    management’s strategic direction as well as other economic
    and market variables. The Company’s policy regarding
    long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill is
    to evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining
    whether the balance can be recovered through undiscounted future
    operating cash flows. Should events or circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value might not be recoverable based on
    undiscounted future operating cash flows, an impairment loss
    would be recognized. The amount of impairment, if any, is
    measured based on the difference between projected discounted
    future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the
    Company’s average cost of funds and the carrying value of
    the asset.



Pension obligations.

The Company has
    defined-benefit pension plans in several of its international
    locations (see Note 15 — Employee Benefits).
    Benefits earned under these plans are based on years of service
    and level of employee compensation. The Company accounts for
    material defined benefit plans in accordance with the
    requirements of FASB ASC Topic 715. The Company determines the
    pension obligations and related benefit expense for these plans
    through actuarial assumptions and valuations. The Company
    recognized $2.2 million, $2.2 million, and
    $2.7 million of expense for these plans in 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively. The Company classifies pension expense in
    SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Foreign currency exposure.

All assets and
    liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into
    U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance
    sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded
    as foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of
    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net within the
    Stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. Income and expense items are translated at average
    exchange rates for the year.

Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions
    denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of
    a subsidiary are included in results of operations within Other
    income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. Net currency transaction (losses) gains were
    $(3.6) million, $(0.9) million, and $4.1 million
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
    offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates. These contracts generally have a short duration
    and are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized
    gains and losses recorded in Other income (expense). The net
    gain (loss) from these contracts was $0.7 million,
    $(0.6) million, and $(3.0) million for 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Fair value disclosures.

The Company’s
    fair value disclosures are included in Note 14 —
    Fair Value Disclosures.

Concentrations of credit risk.

Items that
    potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk
    at December 31, 2009 consist primarily of short-term,
    highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents,
    accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, and a pension
    reinsurance asset. The majority of the Company’s cash
    equivalent investments and its two interest rate swap contracts
    are with investment grade commercial banks that are participants
    in the Company’s Credit Agreement. Accounts receivable
    balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited
    concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base
    and geographic dispersion. The Company’s pension
    reinsurance asset is maintained with a large international
    insurance company that was rated investment grade as of
    December 31, 2009.

Stock repurchase programs.

The Company records
    the cost to repurchase its own shares to treasury stock. During
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded $3.7 million,
    $198.6 million, and $169.1 million, respectively, of
    stock repurchases (see

Note 9-Equity).

Shares repurchased by the Company are added to treasury shares
    and are not retired.

Recent accounting developments.

In January
    2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-6,

Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements

2—ACQUISITIONS

The Company acquired two businesses in December 2009:

AMR Research, Inc.

On December 18, 2009, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of AMR Research, Inc. (“AMR
    Research”), a privately-owned, Boston-based firm with
    170 employees, for approximately $63.0 million in
    cash. AMR is a leading authority on global supply chain and
    supporting technologies. AMR offers operations and technology
    executives of manufacturing and retail companies an integrated
    set of services, including written research, access to research
    analysts, peer networking through its forum advisory services,
    consulting and participation at its executive conferences.
    Gartner’s strategic objective in acquiring AMR is to
    leverage Gartner’s scale and worldwide distribution
    capability and sell AMR’s suite of research, consulting,
    and events offerings to Gartner’s much larger client base
    with supply chain technology concerns, as well as introduce
    AMR’s supply chain clients to Gartner’s suite of
    products. The combination is also expected to drive operational
    efficiencies and cost savings.

Burton Group, Inc.

On December 30, 2009, the Company acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Burton Group, Inc. (“Burton
    Group”), a privately-owned Utah-based firm with
    120 employees, for approximately $55.0 million in
    cash. Burton Group is a leading research and advisory services
    firm that focuses on providing practical, technically in-depth
    advice to front-line IT professionals. Gartner’s strategic
    objective in acquiring Burton Group is to expand Gartner’s
    product and service offerings and to leverage Gartner’s
    scale



and worldwide distribution capability to sell Burton
    Group’s suite of research, consulting, and events offerings
    to Gartner’s much larger client base. The combination is
    also expected to drive operational efficiencies and cost savings.

Operating Results

The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the
    operating results of these acquisitions beginning with their
    respective dates of acquisition, which was not material to the
    Company’s 2009 results. The Company recorded
    $2.9 million of pre-tax acquisition and integration charges
    related to these businesses for the year ended December 31,
    2009, which is classified in Acquisition and integration expense
    in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in these
    charges are legal fees and consultant fees in connection with
    the acquisition and integration, as well as severance costs
    related to redundant headcount.

The Company’s acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group
    were not considered material individually or in the aggregate,
    and as a result pro forma financial statements are not
    presented. However, on a pro forma basis, had the acquisitions
    of these businesses occurred on January 1, 2007, the
    Company would have recorded approximately $72.0 million,
    $79.0 million, and $67.0 million of additional
    revenues in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectfully, while the impact
    to the Company’s consolidated operating income and net
    income for those years would not have been material.

Purchase Price Allocation

Gartner utilized its existing cash on hand and availability
    under its revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions.
    The final acquisition costs are subject to certain post-closing
    and other adjustments. The acquisitions are being accounted for
    under the acquisition method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
    805,

Business Combination,

which requires the
    consideration paid to be allocated to the net assets and
    liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of
    the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the
    estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including
    identifiable intangible assets, was allocated to goodwill.

The Company considers its allocation of the respective purchase
    prices to be preliminary, particularly with respect to the
    valuation of intangibles and certain tax related items. In
    accordance with existing accounting rules, a final determination
    of the purchase price allocation must be made within one year of
    the acquisition dates. The following table represents the
    aggregate preliminary purchase price allocation to the assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed for the two acquisitions
    (dollars in thousands):

Of the total $109.0 million recorded in goodwill,
    $86.1 million, $15.3 million, and $7.6 million
    has been allocated to the Research, Consulting, and Events
    segments, respectively. The Company believes the recorded
    goodwill is supported by the anticipated revenues and synergies
    in general and administrative costs. The preliminary purchase
    price allocation includes an estimate of the fair value of the
    cost to fulfill the deferred revenue obligations which was
    determined by estimating the costs to provide the services plus
    a normal profit margin, and did not include any costs associated
    with selling efforts. The preliminary amount that is expected to
    be deductible for tax purposes is approximately
    $55.4 million.

In connection with the acquisitions, the Company has received
    contractual indemnifications from the selling shareholders for
    certain pre-acquisition liabilities of the acquired companies.
    The Company estimates these liabilities at approximately
    $6.1 million. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, the
    Company has recorded a $6.1 million receivable in Prepaid
    expenses and other current assets and a $6.1 million
    liability in Accrued liabilities, which are included in the
    purchase price allocation table above. The Company believes the
    indemnification assets are fully collectible since a portion of
    the sale proceeds have been escrowed pending resolution of the
    liabilities.



3—DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS

In early 2008 the Company sold its Vision Events business, which
    had been part of the Company’s Events segment, for
    $11.4 million in cash. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic
    205, the operating results of the Vision Events business have
    been reported separately as a discontinued operation for 2008
    and 2007. The Vision Events business generated revenues of zero
    and $20.7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and had
    an operating (loss) income of $(0.3) million and
    $2.9 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company realized net cash proceeds from the sale of
    $7.8 million and recorded a net gain on the sale of
    approximately $7.1 million after deducting direct costs to
    sell, a charge of $1.8 million of Events segment goodwill,
    and related tax charges. The gain is recorded in Income from
    discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

The goodwill charge was recorded in accordance with FASB ASC
    Topic 350, which requires an allocated portion of goodwill to be
    included in the gain or loss on disposal of a portion of a
    reporting unit. The assets and liabilities of the Vision Events
    business that were included in the sale were not material to the
    Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows.

4—OTHER
    CHARGES

The Company recorded Other charges of $0 in both 2009 and 2008
    and $9.1 million in 2007.

Other charges of $9.1 million recorded in 2007 included
    charges of $8.7 million related to a litigation settlement
    and $2.7 million related to our decision to exit consulting
    operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of
    $2.3 million related to an excess facility that was
    returned to service.

Credit Agreement

The Company has a Credit Agreement dated as of January 31,
    2007 that provides for a $300.0 million revolving credit
    facility and a five-year, $180.0 million term loan (the
    “original term loan”). On April 9, 2008, the
    Company entered into a First Amendment (the “First
    Amendment”) with the lenders to the Credit Agreement, which
    provided for a new $150.0 million term loan (the “2008
    term loan”). The revolving credit facility may be increased
    up to an additional $100.0 million at the discretion of the
    Company’s lenders (the “expansion feature”), for
    a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million.
    However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may
    not be available to the Company depending upon prevailing credit
    market conditions. To date the Company has not sought to borrow
    under the expansion feature.

The following table provides information regarding amounts
    outstanding under the Company’s Credit Agreement:

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement carry interest rates that
    are either prime-based or Libor-based. Interest rates under
    these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin between 0.00%
    and 0.75% on Prime-based borrowings and between 0.625% and 1.75%
    on Libor-based borrowings. Generally, the Company’s
    borrowings are Libor-based. The revolving loans may be borrowed,
    repaid and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time
    all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The revolver borrowing
    capacity is reduced for both amounts outstanding under the
    revolver and for letters of credit.



The original term loan will be repaid in 18 consecutive
    quarterly installments which commenced on September 30,
    2007, with the final payment due on January 31, 2012, and
    may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the
    option of the Company. The 2008 term loan is co-terminus with
    the original 2007 term loan under the Credit Agreement and will
    be repaid in 16 consecutive quarterly installments which
    commenced June 30, 2008, plus a final payment due on
    January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time without
    penalty or premium at the option of Gartner.

The Credit Agreement contains certain customary restrictive loan
    covenants, including, among others, financial covenants
    requiring a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge
    coverage ratio, and a minimum annualized contract value ratio
    and covenants limiting Gartner’s ability to incur
    indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, be acquired,
    dispose of assets, pay dividends, repurchase stock, make capital
    expenditures, and make investments. The Company was in full
    compliance with its financial covenants as of December 31,
    2009, after giving effect to the acquisitions. A failure to
    comply with these covenants in the future could result in
    acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the Credit
    Agreement, which would materially impact our financial condition
    unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders.

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

The Company has two interest rate swap contracts:

Swap designated as a hedge

The Company has an interest rate swap contract that hedges the
    base interest rate risk on its original term loan. The effect of
    the swap is to convert the floating base rate on the term loan
    to a fixed rate. Under the swap terms, the Company pays a fixed
    rate of 5.06% on the original term loan and in return receives a
    three-month LIBOR rate. The three-month LIBOR rate received on
    the swap matches the base rate paid on the term loan since the
    Company optionally selects a three-month LIBOR rate on the term
    loan. The notional amount of the interest rate swap declines
    over time and constantly matches the outstanding amount of the
    term loan. Other critical terms of the swap and the term loan
    also match.

The Company accounts for the interest rate swap on its original
    term loan as a cash flow hedge in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
    815. Since the swap is hedging the forecasted interest payments
    on the term loan and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, changes in
    the fair value of the swap are recorded in Other comprehensive
    income as long as the swap continues to be a highly effective
    hedge of the base interest rate risk on the term loan. Any
    ineffective portion of change in the fair value of the hedge is
    recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2009, there was no
    ineffective portion of the hedge. The interest rate swap had a
    negative fair value of approximately $6.6 million at
    December 31, 2009, which is recorded in Other comprehensive
    income, net of tax effect.

Swap not designated as a hedge

On September 30, 2009, the Company discontinued hedge
    accounting on an interest rate swap contract that previously
    hedged the 2008 term loan. In addition, on the same date the
    Company prepaid $40.0 million of the outstanding amount of
    the 2008 term loan.

The interest rate swap had a negative fair value of
    $3.3 million as of September 30, 2009. In accordance
    with the hedge accounting rules in FASB ASC Topic 815, the
    $3.3 million was recorded in Other comprehensive income,
    net of tax effect, as a deferred loss. However, because of the
    $40.0 million loan prepayment, the Company reclassified
    $1.1 million of the deferred loss from Other comprehensive
    income to Interest expense, net. The remaining $2.2 million
    deferred loss in Other comprehensive income as of
    September 30, 2009, will be amortized to interest expense
    through maturity of the 2008 term loan. The 2008 term loan
    matures in January 2012. For the three months ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company reclassified approximately
    $0.4 million of the deferred loss in Other comprehensive
    income to interest expense.

Letters of Credit

The Company issues letters of credit and related guarantees in
    the ordinary course of business. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had outstanding letters of credit and guarantees of
    approximately $2.5 million.

8—COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer
    equipment under operating lease arrangements expiring between
    2010 and 2026. The future minimum annual cash payments under
    non-cancelable operating lease agreements at December 31,
    2009, are as follows (in thousands):

We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in
    the ordinary course of business. We believe that the potential
    liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued from all
    proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material
    effect on our financial position or results of operations when
    resolved in a future period.

The Company has various agreements that may obligate us to
    indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters.
    Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in
    contracts arising in the normal course of business under which
    we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against
    losses arising from a breach of representations related to such
    matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain
    intellectual property rights. It is not possible to predict the
    maximum potential amount of future payments under these
    indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of the
    Company’s obligations and the unique facts of each
    particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under
    these agreements have not been material. As of December 31,
    2009, we did not have any indemnification agreements that would
    require material payments.

The Company received cash proceeds of $1.2 million in 2008
    related to the settlement of a litigation matter which was
    recorded as a gain in Other (expense) income, net in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

9—EQUITY

Capital stock.

Holders of Gartner’s
    Common Stock, par value $.0005 per share (“Common
    Stock”) are entitled to one vote per share on all matters
    to be voted by stockholders. The Company does not currently pay
    cash dividends on its Common Stock. Also, our credit arrangement
    contains a negative covenant which may limit our ability to pay
    dividends.

Share repurchase programs.

The Company has a
    $250.0 million authorized stock repurchase program, of
    which $78.6 million remained available as of
    December 31, 2009. Repurchases are made from

time-to-time

through open market purchases and are subject to the
    availability of stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading
    price of the stock, the Company’s financial performance and
    other conditions. Repurchases are also made from

time-to-time

in connection with the settlement of shared-based compensation
    awards. Repurchases may be funded from cash flow from operations
    and borrowings under the Company’s Credit Agreement.

During 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recorded
    $3.7 million, $198.6 million, and $169.1 million,
    respectively, of Common Stock repurchases. Included in the 2008
    total was $26.9 million for shares repurchased directly
    from Silver Lake Partners and affiliates (collectively,
    “Silver Lake”).

Secondary Offering.

On December 14, 2009,
    Silver Lake sold 7,960,641 shares of Common Stock in a
    secondary offering, which represented its entire remaining
    holdings in the Common Stock. The Company did not receive any of
    the proceeds from the sale of these shares. Additionally, in
    conjunction with the sale, the Amended and Restated
    Securityholders Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2002,
    between the Company and Silver Lake, pursuant to which Silver
    Lake was entitled to designate two board members and to certain
    consent rights, was terminated with the exception of certain
    indemnification rights.

10—STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

The Company grants stock-based compensation awards as an
    incentive for employees and directors to contribute to the
    Company’s long-term success. The Company’s stock
    compensation awards include stock-settled stock appreciation
    rights, restricted stock, service- and performance-based
    restricted stock units, common stock equivalents, and stock
    options. At December 31, 2009, the Company had
    approximately 7.4 million shares of Common Stock available
    for awards of stock-based compensation under its 2003 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, which includes 4.0 million additional
    shares approved by stockholders at the Company’s 2009
    Annual Meeting of Stockholders.



The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by
    SAB No. 107 and SAB No. 110. Stock-based
    compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on
    the date of grant, which is recognized over the related service
    period, net of estimated forfeitures. The service period is the
    period over which the related service is performed, which is
    generally the same as the vesting period.

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the
    fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of
    certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the
    expected life of the stock compensation awards and the
    Company’s Common Stock price volatility. In addition,
    determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic
    expense requires management to estimate the amount of employee
    forfeitures and the likelihood of the achievement of certain
    performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the
    fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated
    periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but
    these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
    application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the
    Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the
    assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the
    quantity and nature of the Company’s stock-based
    compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need
    to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be
    materially different from what has been recorded in the current
    period.

The Company recognized the following amounts of stock-based
    compensation expense (in millions) for the years ended
    December 31:

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had $41.5 million
    of total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost, which is
    expected to be recognized as stock-based compensation expense
    over the remaining weighted-average service period of
    approximately 2 years. Currently, the Company issues
    treasury shares upon the exercise, release or settlement of
    stock-based compensation awards.

Stock-Based Compensation Awards

The following disclosures provide information regarding the
    Company’s stock-based compensation awards, all of which are
    classified as equity awards:

Stock
    Appreciation Rights

Stock-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are
    settled in common shares and are similar to options as they
    permit the holder to participate in the appreciation of the
    Common Stock. SARs may be settled in Common Stock by the
    employee once the applicable vesting criteria have been met.
    When SARs are exercised, the number of shares of Common Stock
    issued is calculated as follows: (1) the total proceeds
    from the SARs exercise (calculated as the closing price of
    Common Stock on the date of exercise less the exercise price of
    the SARs, multiplied by the number of SARs exercised) is divided
    by (2) the closing price of Common Stock on the exercise
    date. The Company will withhold a portion of the Common Stock
    issued upon exercise to satisfy minimum statutory tax
    withholding requirements. SARs recipients do not have any of the
    rights of a Gartner stockholder, including voting rights and the
    right to receive dividends and distributions, until after actual
    shares of Common Stock are issued in respect of the award, which
    is subject to the prior satisfaction of the vesting and other
    criteria relating to such grants. At the present time, SARs are
    awarded only to the Company’s executive officers.

The Company determines the fair value of SARs on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The SARs
    vest ratably over a four-year service period and expire seven
    years from the grant date. Total compensation expense for SARs
    was $4.4 million, $3.2 million, and $2.4 million
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Common Stock
    Equivalents

Restricted stock awards give the awardee the right to vote and
    to receive dividends and distributions on these shares; however,
    the awardee may not sell the restricted shares until all
    restrictions on the release of the shares have lapsed and the
    shares are released.

Restricted stock units (RSUs) give the awardee the right to
    receive Common Stock when the vesting conditions are met and the
    restrictions lapse, and each RSU that vests entitles the awardee
    to one common share. RSU awardees do not have any of the rights
    of a Gartner stockholder, including voting rights and the right
    to receive dividends and distributions, until after the common
    shares are released.

Common stock equivalents (CSEs) are convertible into Common
    Stock, and each CSE entitles the holder to one common share.
    Certain members of our Board of Directors receive
    directors’ fees payable in CSEs unless they opt for cash
    payment. Generally, the CSEs are converted when service as a
    director terminates unless the director has elected accelerated
    release.

The fair value of restricted stock, RSUs, and CSEs is determined
    on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Common
    Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on that date.
    The fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation
    expense as follows: (i) outstanding restricted stock awards
    vest based on the achievement of a market condition and are
    expensed on a straight-line basis over approximately three
    years; (ii) service-based RSUs vest ratably over four years
    and are expensed on a straight-line basis over four years;
    (iii) performance-based RSUs are subject to both
    performance and service conditions, vest ratably over four
    years, and are expensed on an accelerated basis; and
    (iv) CSEs vest immediately and are recorded as expense on
    the date of grant.

Stock
    Options

Historically the Company granted stock options to employees that
    allowed them to purchase shares of Common Stock at a certain
    price. The Company has not made significant stock option grants
    since 2005. All outstanding options are fully vested and there
    is no remaining unamortized cost. The Company received
    approximately $12.2 million in cash from option exercises
    in the year ended December 31, 2009.

Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP
    Plan”) under which eligible employees are permitted to
    purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions, which may not
    exceed 10% of an employee’s compensation (or $23,750 in any
    calendar year), at a price equal to 95% of the Common Stock
    price as reported by the New York Stock Exchange at the end of
    each offering period.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had 1.6 million
    shares of Common Stock available for purchase under the ESPP
    Plan. The ESPP Plan is considered non-compensatory and as a
    result the Company does not record compensation expense related
    to employee share purchases. The Company received
    $2.7 million in cash from share purchases under the ESPP
    Plan in the year ended December 31, 2009.



11—COMPUTATION
    OF EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by
    dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of
    Common Stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects
    the potential dilution of securities that could share in
    earnings. When the impact of common share equivalents is
    antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the basic
    and diluted earnings per share computations (in thousands,
    except per share amounts):

Basic and diluted earnings per share include income from
    discontinued operations of $0.07 per share and $0.03 per share
    for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The following table presents the number of common share
    equivalents that were not included in the computation of diluted
    EPS in the table above because the effect would have been
    antidilutive. During periods with reported income, these common
    share equivalents were antidilutive because their exercise price
    was greater than the average market value of a share of Common
    Stock during the period. During periods with reported loss, all
    common share equivalents would have an antidilutive effect.

Current net deferred tax assets and current net deferred tax
    liabilities were $19.0 million and $1.2 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and $15.7 million and
    $2.8 million as of December 31, 2008, respectively,
    and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets
    and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. Long-term net deferred tax assets and long-term
    net deferred tax liabilities were $29.5 million and
    $0.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    $46.4 million and $1.2 million as of December 31,
    2008, respectively, and are included in Other assets and Other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The valuation allowances in 2009 and 2008 relate primarily to

non-U.S. net

operating losses, domestic capital loss carryforwards, and
    domestic foreign tax credits that more likely than not will
    expire unutilized. The net decrease in the valuation allowance
    of $5.2 million in 2009 relates primarily to the following
    items: (a) the release of approximately $1.9 million
    of the valuation allowance for changes in both actual and
    anticipated utilization of foreign tax credits and (b) the
    release of approximately $3.2 million of the valuation
    allowance on federal and state capital loss carryovers.

The Company has established a full valuation allowance against
    domestic realized and unrealized capital losses, as the future
    utilization of these losses is uncertain. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company had U.S. federal
    capital loss carryforwards of $15.5 million, of which
    $13.4 million expire in 2011 and $2.1 million expire
    in 2012 and 2013. The Company also had $15.5 million in
    state and local capital loss carryforwards that expire over a
    similar period of time.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had federal net
    operating loss carryforwards of $1.8 million expiring in
    2028 and 2029. The utilization of these net operating losses is
    subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.
    The Company believes that the losses will be fully utilized
    prior to their expiration. As of December 31, 2009, the
    Company also has state and local tax net operating loss
    carryforwards of $161.2 million, of which $3.5 million
    expires within one to five years, $98.0 million expires
    within six to fifteen years, and $59.7 million expires
    within sixteen to twenty years. In addition, the Company had

non-U.S. net

operating loss carryforwards of $30.5 million, of which
    $4.7 million expires over the next 20 years and
    $25.8 million that can be carried forward indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2009 the Company also had foreign tax
    credit carryforwards of $12.1 million, all of which expire
    in 2018.

The Company adopted new accounting principles on accounting for
    uncertain tax positions on January 1, 2007. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31 2008, the Company had
    gross unrecognized tax benefits of $13.8 million and
    $16.3 million, respectively. The reduction is primarily
    attributable to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation
    in the third quarter of 2009. It is reasonably possible that the
    gross unrecognized tax benefits will be decreased by
    $0.3 million within the next 12 months due primarily
    to anticipated settlements.



The Company classifies uncertain tax positions not expected to
    be settled within one year as long term liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company
    had Other Liabilities of $13.5 million and
    $14.2 million, respectively, related to long term uncertain
    tax positions.

The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in its income tax provision. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the Company
    had $2.8 million and $3.6 million of accrued interest and
    penalties respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits.
    These amounts are in addition to the gross unrecognized tax
    benefits noted above. The total amount of interest and penalties
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
    years ending December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
    ($0.5) million and $1.4 million, respectively.

In 2009 the Company repatriated approximately $52.0 million
    from its foreign subsidiaries. The cost of the repatriation was
    offset with the utilization of foreign tax credits.

The number of years with open statutes of limitation varies
    depending on the tax jurisdiction. Generally, the Company’s
    statutes are open for tax years ended December 31, 2006 and
    forward. Major taxing jurisdictions include the
    U.S. (federal and state), the United Kingdom, Italy,
    Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, and Ireland.

The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) commenced an
    audit of the Company’s 2007 tax year early in 2009. The
    audit is ongoing and the IRS has not proposed any adjustments at
    this time. The Company believes that it has recorded reserves
    sufficient to cover exposures related to such review. However,
    the resolution of such matters involves uncertainties and there
    are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed
    the amounts recorded. The results of the audit could have a
    material effect on the Company’s financial position,
    results of operations, or cash flows in period or periods for
    which that determination is made.

Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the
    U.S. amounted to approximately $1.6 million as of
    December 31, 2009. The Company intends to reinvest such
    earnings in

non-U.S. operations.

However, the Company may repatriate a portion of these earnings
    to the extent that it does not incur an additional U.S. tax
    liability. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and
    state income taxes has been provided thereon.

13—DERIVATIVES
    AND HEDGING

The Company typically enters into a limited number of derivative
    contracts to offset the potentially negative effects of interest
    rate and foreign exchange movements. The Company accounts for
    its outstanding derivative contracts in accordance with FASB ASC
    Topic 815, which requires all derivatives, whether designated as
    hedges or not, to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.

At December 31, 2009, the Company’s derivative
    counterparties were all large investment grade financial
    institutions. The Company did not have any collateral
    arrangements with its derivative counterparties, and none of the
    derivative contracts contained credit-risk related contingent
    features.

14—FAIR
    VALUE DISCLOSURES

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, fees receivable from customers, accounts payable,
    and accruals which are normally short-term in nature. The
    Company believes the carrying amounts of these financial
    instruments reasonably approximates their fair value.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $329.0 million
    of outstanding floating rate debt which is carried at amortized
    cost. The Company believes the carrying amount of the debt
    reasonably approximates its fair value as the rate of interest
    on the term loans and revolver are floating rate which reflect
    current market rates of interest for similar instruments with
    comparable maturities.

FASB ASC Topic 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value
    and a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs
    used in the valuation of an asset or liability. Classification
    within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
    that is significant to the resulting fair value measurement. The
    valuation hierarchy contains three levels:

•

Level 1—Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market
    prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2—Valuation inputs are quoted prices for
    identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
    quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets and other observable inputs directly or
    indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured.

•

Level 3—Valuation inputs are unobservable and
    significant to the fair value measurement.

15—EMPLOYEE
    BENEFITS

Savings and investment plan.

The Company has
    a savings and investment plan covering substantially all
    domestic employees. Company contributions are based upon the
    level of employee contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of the
    employee’s eligible



salary, subject to an annual maximum. For 2009, the maximum
    match was $6,600. In addition, the Company also contributes at
    least 1% of an employee’s base compensation, subject to an
    IRS annual limitation of $2,450 for 2009. Amounts expensed in
    connection with the plan totaled $13.0 million,
    $12.5 million, and $11.8 million, for 2009, 2008, and
    2007, respectively.

Deferred compensation arrangement.

The
    Company has a supplemental deferred compensation arrangement for
    the benefit of certain highly compensated officers, managers and
    other key employees which is structured as a rabbi trust. We
    classify the plan’s investment assets in Other assets on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets at current fair value, and the
    value of the assets was $20.2 million and
    $13.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The corresponding deferred compensation liability
    of $23.0 million and $16.5 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is recorded at
    fair market value, and is adjusted with a corresponding charge
    or credit to compensation cost to reflect the fair value of the
    amount owed to the employees and is included in Other
    liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total
    compensation expense (benefit) for the arrangement was
    $0.1 million, $(0.4) million, and $0.3 million,
    for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Defined benefit pension plans.

The Company
    has defined-benefit pension plans in several of its
    international locations. Benefits earned under these plans are
    based on years of service and level of employee compensation.
    The Company accounts for material defined benefit plans in
    accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC Topics 715 and 960.

16—SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

The Company manages its business in three reportable segments:
    Research, Consulting and Events. Research consists primarily of
    subscription-based research products, access to research
    inquiry, as well as peer networking services and membership
    programs.

Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement
    engagements, and strategic advisory services. Events consists of
    various symposia, conferences and exhibitions.

The Company evaluates reportable segment performance and
    allocates resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross
    contribution, as presented in the table below, is defined as
    operating income excluding certain cost of services and product
    development and SGA expenses, depreciation, acquisition and
    integration charges, amortization of intangibles and Other
    charges. Certain bonus and fringe benefit costs included in
    consolidated Cost of services and product development are not
    allocated to segment expense. The accounting policies used by
    the reportable segments are the same as those used by the
    Company. There are no intersegment revenues.

We earn revenue from clients in many countries. Other than the
    United States, there is no individual country in which revenues
    from external clients represent 10% or more of the
    Company’s consolidated revenues. Additionally, no single
    client accounted for 10% or more of total revenue and the loss
    of a single client, in management’s opinion, would not have
    a material adverse effect on revenues.

We do not identify or allocate assets, including capital
    expenditures, by operating segment. Accordingly, assets are not
    being reported by segment because the information is not
    available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of
    performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources.

On January 1, 2009 the Company eliminated the previously
    reported “Other” revenue line. The “Other”
    revenue line primarily consisted of fees earned from Research
    reprints and other miscellaneous products, and these revenues
    and related expenses are now being included in the Research
    segment. In addition, certain expenses that were formerly
    classified as Selling, general & administrative
    expense are now reported in Cost of sales and product
    development and are included in the Research segment. Prior
    periods presented below have been reclassified in order to be
    consistent with the current period presentation. For 2008 these
    actions increased Research segment revenue by $8.3 million,
    increased Research segment expense by $20.6 million, and
    decreased Research segment gross contribution by
    $12.3 million. For 2007, these actions increased Research
    segment revenue by $10.0 million, increased Research
    segment expense by $19.4 million, and decreased Research
    segment gross contribution by $9.4 million.

The Company’s consolidated revenues are generated primarily
    through direct sales to clients by domestic and international
    sales forces and a network of independent international sales
    agents. Revenues in the table below are reported based on where
    the sale is fulfilled; “Other International” revenues
    are those attributable to all areas located outside of the
    United States, Canada, and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa).
    Most of our products and services are provided on an integrated
    worldwide basis. Because of the integration of products and
    services delivery, it is not practical to separate precisely our
    revenues by geographic location. Long-lived assets exclude
    goodwill and other intangible assets. Accordingly, the
    separation set forth in the table below is based upon internal
    allocations, which involve certain management estimates and
    judgments.
