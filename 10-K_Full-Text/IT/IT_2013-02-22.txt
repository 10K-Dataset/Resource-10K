PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Gartner, Inc. (“Gartner”) (NYSE:
IT) is the world’s leading information technology research and advisory company. We deliver the technology-related insight
necessary for our clients to make the right decisions, every day. From CIOs and senior IT leaders in corporations and government
agencies, to business leaders in high-tech and telecom enterprises and professional services firms, to supply chain professionals
and technology investors, we are the valuable partner to clients in over 13,300 distinct organizations. We work with clients to
research, analyze and interpret the business of IT within the context of their individual roles. Founded in 1979, Gartner is headquartered
in Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A., and as of December 31, 2012, we had 5,468 associates, including 1,405 research analysts and consultants,
and clients in 85 countries.

The foundation for all Gartner products
and services is our independent research on IT and supply chain issues. The findings from this research are delivered through our
three business segments — Research, Consulting and Events:

•

Research

provides objective insight on critical and timely technology and supply chain initiatives for CIOs, other IT professionals, supply chain leaders, technology companies and the investment community through reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions about their IT and supply chain investments.

•

Consulting

provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site, day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance, efficiency, and quality.

•

Events

provide IT, supply chain and business professionals the opportunity to attend various symposia, conferences and exhibitions to learn, contribute and network with their peers. From our flagship event Symposium/ITxpo, to summits focused on specific technologies and industries, to experimental workshop-style seminars, our events distill the latest Gartner research into applicable insight and advice.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Technological innovations today are changing
how businesses and organizations work and what they do at an increasingly rapid pace. Today, everyone is living and working in
the midst of a technological revolution. Major technological forces - including social media, mobile, cloud and information –
are driving change on a scale not seen before in every organization around the world, from business enterprises of every size,
to governments and government agencies, as well as other organizations. This technology revolution is likely to remain vibrant
for decades to come.

Information technology (IT) is critical
to supporting increased productivity, service improvement and revenue growth. IT and the supply chain are viewed today as strategic
components of growth and operating performance. As the costs of IT solutions continue to rise, IT executives and professionals
have realized the importance of making well-informed decisions and increasingly seek to maximize their returns on IT capital investments.
As a result, any IT investment decision in an enterprise is subject to increased financial scrutiny, especially in the current
challenging economic climate. In addition, today’s IT marketplace is dynamic and complex. Technology providers continually
introduce new products with a wide variety of standards and features that are prone to shorter life cycles. Users of technology
— a group that encompasses nearly all organizations — must keep abreast of new developments in technology to ensure
that their IT systems are reliable, efficient, and meet both their current and future needs.

Given the strategic and critical nature
of technology decision-making and spending, business enterprises, governments and their agencies, and other organizations turn
to Gartner for guidance in order to make the right decisions to maximize the value of their IT investments.

OUR SOLUTION

We provide IT decision makers with the
insight they need to understand where - and how – to successfully use IT and the supply chain to achieve their objectives.
We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital. The foundation
of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published
reports and briefings, consulting and advisory services, and our events, including Gartner Symposium/ITxpo.

Our 902 analysts located around the world
create timely, high-quality, independent and objective research and fact-based analysis on all aspects of the IT industry. Through
our robust product portfolio, our global research team provides thought leadership and


technology insights that CIOs, supply chain
professionals, executives and other technology practitioners need to make the right decisions, every day. In addition to our analysts,
we have 503 experienced consultants who combine our objective, independent research with a practical business perspective focused
on the IT industry. Finally, our events are the largest of their kind, gathering highly qualified audiences of CIOs, other senior
business executives and IT professionals, supply chain leaders, and purchasers and providers of technology and supply chain products
and services.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Our diversified business model provides
multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting services and events.
A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships
with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and advice. We
also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity, and expand into new
markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of
our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning
and cross-selling of our products and services.

Our principal products and services are
delivered via our Research, Consulting and Events segments:

•

RESEARCH.

Gartner delivers independent, objective IT research and insight primarily through a subscription-based, digital media service. Gartner Research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner services and covers all technology-related markets, topics and industries, as well as supply chain topics. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner solutions that address each role within an IT organization. Our Research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. Our Research analysts are in regular contact with both technology providers and technology users, enabling them to identify the most pertinent topics in the IT marketplace and develop relevant product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. They provide in-depth analysis on all aspects of technology, including hardware; software and systems; services; IT management; market data and forecasts; and vertical-industry issues. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s desktop via our website and/or product-specific portals. Clients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content for individual users over a defined period of time, which is typically one year.

•

CONSULTING.

Gartner Consulting deepens relationships with our Research clients by
    extending the reach of our research through custom consulting engagements. Gartner Consulting brings together our unique research
    insight,     benchmarking     data, problem-solving methodologies and hands-on experience to improve the return on a
    client’s IT     investment. Our     consultants provide fact-based consulting services to help clients use and manage
    IT to optimize business     performance.

Consulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our client’s success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance.

Gartner Consulting provides solutions to CIOs and other IT executives, and to those professionals responsible for IT applications, enterprise architecture, go-to-market strategies, infrastructure and operations, programs and portfolio management, and sourcing and vendor relationships. Consulting also provides targeted consulting services to professionals in specific industries. Finally, we provide actionable solutions for IT cost optimization, technology modernization and IT sourcing optimization initiatives.

•

EVENTS.

Gartner Symposium/ITxpo events and Gartner Summit events are gatherings of technology’s most senior IT professionals, business strategists and practitioners. Gartner Events offers current, relevant and actionable technology sessions led by Gartner analysts to clients and non-clients. These sessions are augmented with technology showcases, peer exchanges, analyst one-on-one meetings, workshops and keynotes by technology’s top leaders. They also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with business executives from the world’s leading technology companies.

Gartner Events attract high-level IT and business professionals who seek in-depth knowledge about technology products and services. Gartner Symposium/ITxpo events are large, strategic conferences held in various locations throughout the world for CIOs and other senior IT and business professionals. Gartner Summit events focus on specific topics, technologies and industries, providing IT professionals with the insight, solutions and networking opportunities to succeed in their job role. Finally, we offer targeted events for CIOs and IT executives, such as CIO Leadership Forum.


COMPETITION

We believe that the principal factors that
differentiate us from our competitors are the following:

•

Superior IT research content — We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage of the IT industry. Our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.

•

Our leading brand name — We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for over 30 years.

•

Our global footprint and established customer base — We have a global presence with clients in 85 countries on six continents. For both 2012 and 2011, 46% of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the U.S.

•

Experienced management team — Our management team is composed of IT research veterans and experienced industry executives.

•

Substantial operating leverage in our business model — We have the ability to distribute our intellectual property and  expertise across multiple platforms, including research publications, consulting engagements, conferences and executive programs, to derive incremental revenues and profitability.

•

Vast network of analysts and consultants — As of December 31, 2012, we had 1,405 research analysts and consultants located around the world. Our analysts collectively speak 47 languages and are located in 26 countries, enabling us to cover all aspects of IT on a global basis.

Notwithstanding these differentiating factors,
we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly
against consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors
could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that
are available to our clients through the Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a
result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. However,
we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition. Increased competition may result
in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased sales and marketing expenditures.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success has resulted in part from proprietary
methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent,
copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property
rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership and the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property,
and we also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these
agreements if necessary.

We recognize the value of our intellectual
property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract
compliance by our end users.

EMPLOYEES

We had 5,468 employees as of December 31,
2012, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year end as we continued to invest for future growth. We have 976 employees located
at our headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and a nearby office in Trumbull, Connecticut; 2,198 employees located elsewhere in
the United States; and 2,294 employees located outside of the United States. Our employees may be subject to collective bargaining
agreements at a company or industry level in those foreign countries where this is part of the local labor law or practice. We
have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be favorable.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

We operate in a highly competitive and
rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition,
we and our clients are affected by global economic conditions. The following sections discuss many, but not all, of the risks and
uncertainties that may affect our future performance, but is not intended to be all-inclusive. Any of the risks described below
could have a material adverse impact on our

business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows,
and could

therefore have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally risks not currently known
to us or that we now deem immaterial may

also harm us and negatively affect your investment.

Risks related to our business

Our operating results could be negatively
impacted by global economic

conditions.

Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and trends, in the U.S
and abroad. Among these conditions are government deficit spending in the U.S. and other countries, ongoing uncertainty in global
trade, difficulties related to the refinancing of sovereign debt, and currency stability. In addition, there continues to be risks
related to one or more Euro-Zone countries discontinuing the use of the Euro as their currency. These conditions could negatively
and materially affect future demand for our products and services. Such difficulties could include the ability to maintain client
retention, wallet retention and consulting utilization rates, achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth, attract attendees
and exhibitors to our events or obtain new clients. Such developments could negatively impact our financial condition, results
of operations, and cash flows.

We face significant competition and
our failure to compete successfully could

materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services, including information
available on the Internet free of charge. We also compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers,
including electronic and print media companies, some of which may have greater financial, information gathering and marketing resources
than we do. These indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, limited barriers
to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors
may start to provide additional or complementary services. Additionally, technological advances may provide increased competition
from a variety of sources.

There can be no assurance that we will
be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market
share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures. Furthermore, we may
not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and analysis, timely delivery of information, customer
service, and the ability to offer products to meet changing market needs for information and analysis, or price.

We may not be able to maintain our existing
products and services.

We operate in a rapidly evolving market, and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high quality
and timely research and analysis to our clients. Any failure to continue to provide credible and reliable information that is useful
to our clients could have a material adverse effect on future business and operating results. Further, if our predictions prove
to be wrong or are not substantiated by appropriate research, our reputation may suffer and demand for our products and services
may decline. In addition, we must continue to improve our methods for delivering our products and services in a cost-effective
manner. Failure to increase and improve our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating
results.

We may not be able to enhance and develop
our existing products and services,

or introduce the new products and services that are needed to remain

competitive.

The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information and analysis on the IT
industry as a whole. The development of new products is a complex and time-consuming process. Nonetheless, to maintain our competitive
position, we must continue to anticipate the needs of our client organizations, enhance and improve our products and services,
develop or acquire new products and services, deliver all products and services in a timely manner, and appropriately position
and price new products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them. Any failure to achieve successful
client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position. Additionally, significant delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new
products or services could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.

We depend on renewals of subscription-based
services and sales of new

subscription-based services for a significant portion of our revenue, and our

failure to
renew at historical rates or generate new sales of such services

could lead to a decrease in our revenues.

A large portion
of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our subscription-based research products and services and new sales
of such products and services, both to new clients and existing clients. These products and services constituted 70% and 69% of
our revenues for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Generating new sales of our subscription-based products and services, both to new
and existing clients, is often a time consuming process. If we are unable to generate new sales, due to competition or other factors,
our revenues will be adversely affected.


Our research subscription agreements are
generally for twelve months. Our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors, including the following:

•

delivering high-quality and timely analysis and advice to our clients;

•

understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients; and

•

delivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition.

Additionally, as we continue to adjust
our products and service offerings to meet our clients’ continuing needs, we may shift the type and pricing of our products
which may impact client renewal rates. While our research client retention rate was 83% at December 31, 2012 and 82% at December
31, 2011, there can be no guarantee that we will continue to maintain this rate of client renewals.

We depend on non-recurring consulting
engagements and our failure to secure new

engagements could lead to a decrease in our revenues.

Consulting segment revenues
constituted 19% of our total revenues for 2012 and 21% for 2011. Consulting engagements typically are project-based and non-recurring.
Our ability to replace consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors, including the following:

•

delivering consistent, high-quality consulting services to our clients;

•

tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients; and

•

our ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements.

Any material decline in our ability to
replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact on our revenues and our financial condition.

The profitability and success of our
conferences, symposia and events could be

adversely affected by external factors beyond our control.

The market for
desirable dates and locations for conferences, symposia and events is highly competitive. If we cannot secure desirable dates and
locations for our conferences, symposia and events their profitability could suffer, and our financial condition and results of
operations may be adversely affected. In addition, because our events are scheduled in advance and held at specific locations,
the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our control, such as labor strikes, transportation shutdowns
and travel restrictions, economic slowdowns, terrorist attacks, weather, natural disasters, and other occurrences impacting the
global, regional, or national economy, the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event and as the
global economy recovers, our ability to procure space for our events and keep associated costs down could become more challenging.

Our sales to governments are subject
to appropriations and may be terminated.

We derive significant revenues from contracts with the U.S. government and its respective
agencies, numerous state and local governments and their respective agencies, and foreign governments and their agencies. At December
31, 2012 and 2011, approximately $255.0 million and $225.0 million, respectively, of our Research contract value and Consulting
backlog was attributable to governments. We believe substantially all of the amount attributable to governments at December 31,
2012 will be filled in 2013. Our U.S. government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations by the U.S. Congress to
fund the agencies contracting for our services, and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government
authorizations and funding approvals and mechanisms. In general, most if not all of these contracts may be terminated at any time
without cause (“termination for convenience”). Additionally, many state governments, their agencies, and municipalities
across the United States are under severe financial strain and are considering significant budget cuts. Should appropriations for
the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed, or should government contracts be terminated for convenience,
we may experience a significant loss of segment and consolidated revenues.

We may not be able to attract and retain
qualified personnel which could

jeopardize the quality of our products and services.

Our success depends heavily upon
the quality of our senior management, research analysts, consultants, sales and other key personnel. We face competition for the
limited pool of these qualified professionals from, among others, technology companies, market research firms, consulting firms,
financial services companies and electronic and print media companies, some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate
these professionals. Some of the personnel that we attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could impede our
short-term recruitment efforts. Any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required
to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business, could adversely affect the quality of our products and services,
as well as future business and operating results.

We may not be able to maintain the equity
in our brand name.

We believe that our “Gartner” brand, including our independence, is critical to our efforts
to attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition increases. We may expand
our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the Gartner brand and may need to increase our marketing budget, hire additional
marketing and public relations personnel, and expend additional sums to protect our brand and otherwise increase


expenditures to create and maintain client
brand loyalty. If we fail to effectively promote and maintain the Gartner brand, or incur excessive expenses in doing so, our future
business and operating results could be adversely impacted.

Our international operations expose
us to a variety of operational risks which

could negatively impact our future revenue and growth.

We have clients in
85 countries and a substantial amount of our revenues are earned outside of the U.S. Our operating results are subject to the risks
inherent in international business activities, including general political and economic conditions in each country, changes in
market demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations, changes
in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates
and laws, and the difficulty of enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property
rights in international jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on local distributors or sales agents in some international locations.
If any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us, we may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms
or on a timely basis, or clients of the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our
new agent.

Our international operations expose
us to volatility in foreign currency

exchange rates.

Revenues earned outside the U.S. are typically transacted in local
currencies, which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent
to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign
currency fluctuations.

Natural disasters or geo-political events
may disrupt our business.

A major weather event, terrorist attack, earthquake, flood, volcanic activity, or other catastrophic
disaster could significantly disrupt our operations. Such events could cause delays in initiating or completing sales, impede delivery
of our products and services to our clients, disrupt other critical client-facing and business processes, or dislocate our critical
internal functions and personnel. Our corporate headquarters is located approximately 30 miles from New York City, and we have
an operations center located in Ft. Myers, Florida, a hurricane-prone area. We also operate in numerous international locations,
and we have offices in a number of major cities across the globe. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict
pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries and regions, which may negatively impact our sales and increase
our operating costs. Additionally, these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget decisions of our clients.
Such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition
and operating results.

Internet and critical internal computer
system failures, cyber-attacks, or compromises of our systems or security could damage our reputation and harm our business.

A significant portion of our business is conducted over the Internet and we rely heavily on computer systems. A cyber-attack, widespread
Internet failure, or disruption of our critical information technology systems through viruses or other events could cause delays
in initiating or completing sales, impede delivery of our products and services to our clients, disrupt other critical client-facing
or business processes, or dislocate our critical internal functions. Such events could significantly harm our ability to conduct
normal business operations and negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.

We take steps generally acknowledged as
standard for the industry to secure our management information systems, including our computer systems, intranet, proprietary websites,
email and other telecommunications and data networks, and we carefully scrutinize the security of outsourced website and service
providers prior to retaining their services. However, the security measures implemented by us or by our outside service providers
may not be effective and our systems (and those of our outside service providers) may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and
interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, cyber-attacks,
computer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. Our reputation, brand, financial condition and/or operating results could
be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or other technology-related catastrophe, our operations are
disrupted or shutdown; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; we incur costs or are required to pay
fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we are required to dedicate significant
resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs
as a result of these occurrences.

We may experience outages and disruptions
of our online services if we fail to

maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.

Our increasing user traffic and
complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial
amounts to maintain data centers and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic
on our websites. However, any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products, services, and
user experience, resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, potentially
harming our financial condition and operating results.


Our outstanding debt obligation
could impact our financial condition or future operating results.

We have a credit arrangement that provides for a
five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility (the “2010 Credit Agreement”). The credit arrangement contains an
expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving facility may be increased, at our option and under certain conditions,
by up to an additional $150.0 million in the aggregate which may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing
credit market conditions. At both December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had a total of $200.0 million outstanding under the
2010 Credit Agreement.

The affirmative, negative and financial
covenants of the 2010 Credit Agreement could limit our future financial flexibility. Additionally, a failure to comply with these
covenants could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the arrangement, which would materially impact our financial
condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders. No assurance can be given that we would be successful in
doing so in this current financial climate, or that any accommodations that we were able to negotiate would be on terms as favorable
as those presently contained in the credit arrangement. The associated debt service costs of this credit arrangement could impair
our future operating results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or additional credit available to us, which could
restrain our ability to expand or enhance products and services, respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities
requiring substantial investments of additional capital.

We may require additional cash resources
which may not be available on

favorable terms or at all.

We believe that our existing cash balances, projected cash
flow from operations, and the borrowing capacity we have under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our plans
for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.

However, we may require additional cash
resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program, to repay indebtedness
or to pursue future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital. If our existing financial resources
are insufficient to satisfy our requirements, we may seek additional borrowings. Prevailing credit market conditions may negatively
affect debt availability and cost, and, as a result, financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if
at all. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require
us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations.

If we are unable to enforce and protect
our intellectual property rights our

competitive position may be harmed.

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark,
trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite
our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information
that we regard as proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide
significant protection for us. The laws of certain countries, particularly in emerging markets, do not protect our proprietary
rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property
against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Our employees are subject
to non-compete agreements. When the non-competition period expires, former employees may compete against us. If a former employee
chooses to compete against us prior to the expiration of the non-competition period, we seek to enforce these non-compete provisions
but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts. Additionally, there can be no assurance that another party
will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights.

We have grown, and may continue to grow,
through acquisitions and strategic

investments, which could involve substantial risks.

We have made and may continue
to make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses that offer complementary products and services. The risks involved
in each acquisition or investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition, dilution
of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital, increased indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed
liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company, the inability to integrate
the business of the acquired company, the time to train the sales force to market and sell the products of the acquired business,
the potential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our business. The realization of any of
these risks could adversely affect our business. Additionally, we face competition in identifying acquisition targets and consummating
acquisitions.

We face risks related to litigation.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to a variety of legal actions, such as employment, breach of contract, intellectual
property-related, and business torts, including claims of unfair trade practices and misappropriation of trade secrets. Given the
nature of our business, we are also subject to defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to
the information we publish. Regardless of the merits, responding to any such claim could be time consuming, result in costly litigation
and require us to enter into settlements, royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable
terms. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms, our business, results of operations
or financial position could be materially adversely affected.


We face risks related to taxation.

We
operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions. Changes to the tax laws as well as the level of operations and profitability
in each jurisdiction may have an unfavorable impact upon the amount of taxes that we recognize in any given year. In addition,
our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business, and
in the ordinary course of business, we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time. These audits may result
in assessments of additional taxes, and resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the
ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts we have recorded. Additionally, the results of an audit could have a material effect
on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Our corporate compliance program cannot
guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

We operate in a number of countries, and as a
result we are required to comply with numerous, and in many cases, changing international and U.S. federal, state and local laws
and regulations. As a result, we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program which includes the creation of appropriate
policies defining employee behavior that mandate adherence to laws, employee training, annual affirmations, monitoring and enforcement.
However, if any employee fails to comply with, or intentionally disregards, any of these laws or regulations, a range of liabilities
could result for the employee and for the Company, including, but not limited to, significant penalties and fines, sanctions and/or
litigation, and the expenses associated with defending and resolving any of the foregoing, any of which could have a material impact
on our business.

Risks related to our Common Stock

Our operating results may fluctuate
from period to period and may not meet the

expectations of securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given,

which may cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.

Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the
future as a result of many factors, including the timing of the execution of research contracts, the extent of completion of consulting
engagements, the timing of symposia and other events, the amount of new business generated, the mix of domestic and international
business, currency fluctuations, changes in market demand for our products and services, the timing of the development, introduction
and marketing of new products and services, and competition in the industry. An inability to generate sufficient earnings and cash
flow, and achieve our forecasts, may impact our operating and other activities. The potential fluctuations in our operating results
could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of
future operating results. Furthermore, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors
in the future or guidance we have given. If this occurs, the price of our stock would likely decline.

Our stock price may be impacted by factors
outside of our control and you may

not be able to resell shares of our Common Stock at or above the price you

paid.

The trading prices of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to, among other factors, developments
in the industries in which we do business, general economic conditions, general market conditions, changes in the nature and composition
of our stockholder base, changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our securities and our performance relative
to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly period, as well as other factors outside of our control. These factors
may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.

Future sales of our Common Stock in
the public market could lower our stock

price.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock in the public
market by our current stockholders, or the threat that substantial sales may occur, could cause the market price of our Common
Stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling stock. Furthermore, we have
various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units and other stock-based awards which have the effect of adding shares of Common Stock into the public market.

As of December 31, 2012, the
aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was
approximately 4.8 million shares (approximately 1.2 million of which have vested). In addition, approximately 6.4 million
shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans. Shares of Common Stock issued under
these plans are freely transferable without further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), except for any shares held by affiliates (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act). We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Common Stock or the effect, if any, that future
issuances and sales of shares of our Common Stock will have on the market price of our Common Stock.

Interests of certain of our significant
stockholders may conflict with yours

. To our knowledge, as of December 31, 2012, and based upon publicly-available SEC filings,
four institutional investors each presently hold over 5% of our Common Stock. While no stockholder or institutional investor individually
holds a majority of our outstanding shares, these significant stockholders may be able, either individually or acting together,
to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of
our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans and approval of significant transactions such as mergers,
acquisitions, consolidations and sales or purchases of assets. In addition, in the event of a proposed acquisition of the Company
by a third party, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in us. Accordingly, the interests of
these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, or otherwise be in the best
interests of us or all stockholders.


Our anti-takeover protections may discourage
or prevent a change of control,

even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of our
restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us
in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions include:

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock;

•

advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings; and

•

the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law.

These provisions could discourage or prevent
a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their Common
Stock.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

The Company has no unresolved written comments
that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports
under the Exchange Act.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

We lease 29 domestic and 49 international
offices and we have a significant presence in Stamford, Connecticut; Ft. Myers, Florida; and Egham, the United Kingdom. The Company
does not own any properties.

Our corporate headquarters is located in
approximately 213,000 square feet of leased office space in three buildings located in Stamford. This facility also accommodates
research and analysis, marketing, sales, client support, production, corporate services, and administration. In 2010, the Company
entered into an amended and restated lease agreement for the Stamford headquarters facility that provides for a term of fifteen
years. The amended lease also grants the Company three options to renew the lease at fair market value for five years each, an
option to purchase the facility at fair market value, and a $25.0 million tenant improvement allowance provided by the landlord
to renovate the three buildings comprising the facility. The renovation work commenced in 2011 and to date the renovation of two
buildings has been completed. Renovation on the third building is expected to be completed in March 2013.

Our Ft. Myers operations are located in
120,000 square feet of leased office space in one building for which the lease will expire in 2026. Our Egham location has approximately
72,000 square feet of leased office space in two buildings for which the leases expire in 2020 and 2025, respectively. Our other
domestic and international locations support our research, consulting, domestic and international sales efforts, and other functions.

We evaluate our space needs on a continuous
basis as our business changes. While our existing facilities are adequate for our current and foreseeable needs, should additional
space be necessary, we believe that it will be available at reasonable terms.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved in various legal and administrative
proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these individual matters is not predictable
at this time. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, after considering amounts already accrued and
insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in
future periods.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.

Not applicable.

The following items impact the comparability

·

In 2012 we acquired Ideas International, Inc. and recognized $2.4 million in pre-tax acquisition and integration charges (see Note 2 — Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, in 2009 we acquired AMR Research, Inc. and Burton Group, Inc., and in 2010 and 2009 we recognized $7.9 million and $2.9 million in pre-tax acquisition charges. The results of these businesses, which were not material, were included beginning on their respective acquisition dates.

·

In 2012 we repurchased 2.7 million of our common shares under our share repurchase program at a total cost of $111.3 million. We also repurchased 5.9 million, 3.9 million, 0.3 million, and 9.7 million of our common shares in 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively (see Note 7 — Stockholders’ Equity in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

·

In 2010 we refinanced our debt (see Note 5 — Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In conjunction with the refinancing, we recorded $3.7 million in incremental pre-tax charges in that year related to the termination of the previous credit arrangement.

·

In 2008 we sold our Vision Events business, which had been part of our Events segment. Accordingly, the results of operations of this business and the related gain on sale were reported as a discontinued operation.


ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The purpose of the following Management’s
Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is to help facilitate the understanding of significant factors influencing the
operating results, financial condition and cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A also conveys our expectations
of the potential impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read this discussion
in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. Historical results and percentage
relationships are not necessarily indicative of operating results for future periods. References to “the Company,”
“we,” “our,” and “us” are to Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

In 2012 we acquired Ideas International
Limited (“Ideas International”), a publicly-owned Australian corporation (see Note 2 — Acquisition in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Ideas International’s business operations have been
integrated into the Company’s Research segment, and its operating results and business measurements are included in the Company’s
consolidated and segment results beginning on the date of acquisition. The impact of the acquisition was not material.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information,
this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are any statements other
than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding
the future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,”
“expect,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” or other words of similar meaning.

Forward-looking statements are subject
to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk
Factors. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinion
only as of the date on which they were made. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to review or update these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances as they occur. Readers should review carefully any risk factors described in other
reports we filed with the SEC.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Gartner, Inc. is the world’s leading
information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises.
We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications
and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to thousands of client organizations across
the globe. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and executives from a wide variety of business enterprises,
government agencies and the investment community.

We have three business segments: Research,
Consulting and Events.

•

Research

provides objective insight on critical and timely technology and supply
chain initiatives for CIOs, other IT professionals, supply chain leaders, technology companies and the investment community through
reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services, and membership programs that enable our
clients to make better decisions about their IT and supply chain investments.

•

Consulting

provides customized solutions to unique client needs through on-site,
day-to-day support, as well as proprietary tools for measuring and improving IT performance with a focus on cost, performance,
efficiency, and quality.

•

Events

provide IT, supply chain, and business professionals the opportunity to attend
various symposia, conferences and exhibitions to learn, contribute and network with their peers. From our flagship event Symposium/ITxpo,
to Summits focused on specific technologies and industries, to experimental workshop-style Seminars, our events distill the latest
Gartner research into applicable insight and advice.

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

We believe the following business measurements
are important performance indicators for our business segments:

BUSINESS SEGMENT

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

Research

Contract value

represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related
    research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription
    research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract.


Client retention rate

represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed
    business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current
    clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago.

Wallet retention rate

represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have
    retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract
    value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier, excluding the impact
    of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending
    clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both.

Consulting

Consulting backlog

represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting,
    measurement and strategic advisory services engagements.

Utilization rate

represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization
    rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available
    to bill.

Billing rate

represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours.

Average annualized revenue per billable headcount

represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically
    by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one
    year.

Events

Number of events

represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period.

Number of attendees

represents the total number of people who attend events.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

We have executed a consistent growth strategy
since 2005 to drive double-digit annual revenue and earnings growth. The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating
extraordinary research content, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability,
providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational
effectiveness.

We had total revenues of $1,615.8 million
in 2012, an increase of 10% over 2011 while diluted earnings per share increased by $.34 per share, to $1.73. Excluding the impact
of foreign currency, 2012 total revenues increased 12% over 2011.

Research revenues rose 12% year-over-year,
to $1,137.1 million in 2012, and the contribution margin increased 1 point, to 68%. At December 31, 2012, Research contract value
was $1,262.9 million, an increase of 14% over December 31, 2011 adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. Client retention was
83% and wallet retention was 99% at December 31, 2012.

Consulting revenues in 2012 decreased 1%
compared to 2011, while the gross contribution margin was 36%. Consultant utilization was 67% for 2012 compared to 65% in 2011,
and we had 503 billable consultants at December 31, 2012 compared to 481 at year-end 2011. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year,
to $102.7 million at December 31, 2012.

Events revenues increased 17% year-over-year,
to $173.8 million, while the segment contribution margin was 46%. We held 62 events in 2012 compared to 60 in 2011, with an increase
in overall attendance of 8%, to 46,307.

For a more detailed discussion of our results,
see the Segment Results section below.

Cash flow from our operating activities
increased 9% in 2012 compared to 2011, to $279.8 million. We continued to focus on maximizing shareholder value in 2012, and we
repurchased 2.7 million of our common shares outstanding during the year. We ended 2012 with almost $300.0 million in cash and
cash equivalents. In addition to our record year-end cash balance, as of year-end 2012 we also had almost $347.0 million of borrowing
capacity on our $400.0 million revolving credit facility. We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated
needs.

The Company’s 2010
Credit Agreement expires in December 2015. The Company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of
favorable market conditions.


FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS

Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating
income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally
held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between
domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates;
the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; general
economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause
period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating
results and cash flows.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements
requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described
in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to
an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and
estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below.

The preparation of our financial statements
also requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical
experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust
such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments
and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as
such these estimates may ultimately differ from actual results. On-going changes in our estimates could be material and would be
reflected in the Company’s financial statements in future periods.

Our critical accounting policies are as follows:

Revenue recognition

— Revenue is recognized in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (“SAB 101”), and
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (“SAB 104”). Revenue is only recognized once all required
criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:

•

Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products and are deferred
and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees from research reprints are recognized when the reprint is shipped.

•

Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements.
Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements
are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent
in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.

•

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference
or exhibition.

The majority of research contracts are
billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable
and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record
the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding
amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.

Uncollectible fees receivable

—
We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against
earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance
for losses is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions
and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation
reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes
available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and
credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the
effectiveness of our collection efforts.

The following table provides our total
fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands):

Goodwill and other intangible assets

— The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC) Topic 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable
intangible assets may also be performed on a periodic basis should events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. If we
determine that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its related carrying amount, we must recognize
an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review are the
following:

•

Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business;

•

Significant negative industry or general economic trends;

•

Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and

•

Our market capitalization relative to net book value.

The annual assessment of the recoverability
of recorded goodwill can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two. Both methods require
the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the
precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. In 2012, we completed the required annual goodwill
impairment test utilizing a qualitative approach. Based on this assessment, the Company believes the fair values of the Company’s
reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts. See Note 1 — Business and Significant
Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.

Accounting for income taxes

—
As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate.
This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are
included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future
realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable
income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event
we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment
is made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine
that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance
is charged against income in the period such determination is made.

Accounting for stock-based compensation

— The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”) and No. 110 (“SAB No. 110”). The Company recognizes
stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service
period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 8 — Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding stock-based compensation).

Determining the appropriate fair value
model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions,
including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company’s Common Stock price volatility. In addition,
determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures
and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation
awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the
assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company’s stock-based compensation
awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different
from what has been recorded in the current period.

Restructuring and other accruals

— We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations,
asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain
businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments,
sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions
are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these
actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved.

We also record accruals during the year
for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates
and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until after
year end.

2012 VERSUS 2011

TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2012 increased $147.2 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Total
revenues increased 12% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased by double-digits in both our
Research and Events segments but declined slightly in Consulting. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions,
with a double-digit increase in Research revenues in every region.

An overview of our revenues by geographic
region follows:

•

Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 10%, to $947.1 million in 2012
from $861.5 million in 2011.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased to $458.6 million
in 2012 from $437.2 million in 2011, a 5% increase.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased to $210.1 million in
2012 from $169.9 million in 2011, a 24% increase.


An overview
of our revenues by segment follows:

•

Research

revenues increased 12% in 2012, to $1,137.1 million compared to $1,012.1 million
in 2011, and comprised 70% and 69% of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues decreased 1% in 2012, to $304.9 million compared to $308.0 million in
2011, and comprised 19% and 21% of our total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

•

Events

revenues increased 17% in 2012, to $173.8 million compared to $148.5 million in 2011,
and comprised 11% of total revenues in 2012 and 10% in 2011.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A
below entitled “Segment Results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.

COST OF SERVICES AND
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (“COS”) expense increased 8% in 2012, or $50.3 million, to $659.1 million compared to $608.8
million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount as we
continued to invest to support the growth in our business, and to a lesser extent, merit salary increases. We also had higher
conference costs and related travel expenses due to an increase in the number of events, as well as additional attendees and
exhibitors at our events. These additional costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. COS as a
percentage of revenues was 41% for both periods.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”)
expense increased by $65.1 million in 2012, or 11%, to $678.8 million compared to $613.7 million in 2011. The increase was primarily
due to higher payroll and related benefits costs, which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. The higher payroll
and benefit cost was primarily driven by our investment in additional headcount, and to a lesser extent, higher sales commissions
and merit salary increases. The increased headcount includes additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,417
at December 31, 2012, a 12% increase over the prior year-end.

DEPRECIATION expense
decreased slightly year-over-year due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated which was only partially offset by the
additional depreciation related to asset additions. Capital expenditures increased to $44.3 million in 2012 from $42.0
million in 2011, which includes $17.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, of expenditures for the renovation of our
Stamford headquarters facility. Up to $25.0 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord, and as of
December 31, 2012, $22.0 million had been reimbursed.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES decreased year-over-year
due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized, which was only partially offset by the additional amortization from the intangible
assets recorded from the Ideas International acquisition in mid-2012.

ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was
$2.4 million in 2012 and zero in 2011. These charges related to the acquisition of Ideas International and included legal, consulting,
severance, and other costs.

OPERATING INCOME increased $31.6 million
year-over-year, or 15%, to $245.7 million in 2012 from $214.1 million in 2011. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was
15% for both periods. Although both Research and Events had higher segment contributions in 2012, these increases were partially
offset by a lower contribution in Consulting, as well as higher SG&A expenses, as discussed above.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET declined by 11% in
2012 when compared to 2011. The decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding, which declined to $207.0
million in 2012 from $220.0 million in 2011, as well as lower amortization of capitalized debt refinancing costs.

OTHER EXPENSE, NET was $1.3 million in
2012 and $1.9 million in 2011. These expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

was
$69.7 million in 2012 compared to $65.3 million in 2011 and the effective tax rate was 29.6% for 2012 compared to 32.3% for 2011.
The lower effective tax rate in 2012 was primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits in 2012 resulting from the settlement
of tax audits, as well as benefits recorded in 2012 relating to the recognition of certain state tax credits.

During 2012, the Company closed the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of its 2007 federal income tax return. The resolution of the audit did not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company.

In 2011 the IRS commenced an audit of the
Company’s federal income tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. The IRS has proposed adjustments for both 2008 and
2009 and the Company expects to settle the audit in early 2013. Although the audit has not been fully resolved, the Company believes
that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results
of operations.


The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012
(the “Tax Act”) was enacted in January of 2013 and contains beneficial tax provisions for the Company which apply retroactively
to 2012. However, since the Tax Act was passed in 2013, approximately $1.5 million of tax benefits relating to its retroactive
application will be recorded by the Company in the first quarter of 2013.

NET INCOME was $165.9 million in
2012 and $136.9 million in 2011, an increase of $29.0 million, or 21%, primarily due to a higher operating income, which
was partially offset by $4.4 million in higher income tax charges. Although the year-over-year effective tax rate declined,
pre-tax income increased substantially, resulting in the higher dollar amount of tax charges. Both basic and diluted earnings
per share increased 24% year-over-year due to the higher net income and to a lesser extent a lower
number of weighted-average shares outstanding.

2011 VERSUS 2010

TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2011 increased $180.1 million, or 14%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Total revenues increased
11% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased across all of our geographic regions and in all three of our business
segments on a reported basis.

An overview of our results by geographic
region follows:

•

Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 12%, to $861.5 million in 2011
from $765.8 million in 2010.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased to $437.2 million
in 2011 from $380.8 million in 2010, a 15% increase.

•

Revenues from sales to clients in our Other International region increased 20%, to $169.9 million
in 2011 from $141.9 million in 2010.

An overview
of our results by segment follows:

•

Research

revenues increased 17% in 2011, to $1,012.1 million compared to $865.0 million
in 2010, and comprised 69% and 67% of our total revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues increased 2% in 2011, to $308.0 million compared to $302.1 million in
2010, and comprised approximately 21% and 23% of our total revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

•

Events

revenues increased 22% in 2011, to $148.5 million compared to $121.3 million in 2010,
and comprised approximately 10% of total revenues in both 2011 and 2010.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A
below entitled “Segment Results” for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.

COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
(“COS”) expense increased 10% in 2011, or $56.5 million, to $608.8 million compared to $552.2 million in 2010. Approximately
half of the increase was due to higher payroll and related benefits costs resulting from our investment in additional headcount
and merit salary increases. The rest of the increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation,
as well as incremental expenses and additional investment in the Events business. COS as a percentage of revenues improved by 2
points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher research revenues and the operating leverage inherent in our Research business.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”)
expense increased by $70.5 million in 2011, or 13%, to $613.7 million from $543.2 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due
to higher payroll and to a lesser extent, the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the unfavorable impact
of foreign exchange, SG&A expense increased 11% year-over-year. The higher payroll costs resulted from additional investment
in headcount, as well as higher sales commissions and merit salary increases. The increased headcount was primarily due to our
investment in additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased 21% compared to December 31, 2010.

DEPRECIATION expense increased slightly
year-over-year. Capital spending increased to $42.0 million in 2011 from $21.7 million in 2010. The $42.0 million of capital expenditures
in 2011 included $9.5 million of expenditures related to the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility, of which $9.0 million
was reimbursed by our landlord in 2011.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES decreased 38%
year-over-year due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2010.

ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was
zero in 2011 and $7.9 million in 2010. These charges related to the acquisitions of AMR Research and Burton Group in December 2009
and included legal, consulting, severance, and other costs.


OPERATING INCOME increased $64.8 million
year-over-year, or 43%, to $214.1 million in 2011 from $149.3 million in 2010. Operating income as a percentage of revenues improved
by 3 points year-over-year, to 15% in 2011 compared to 12% in 2010, primarily due to a significantly higher segment contribution
from the Research business and to a lesser extent, lower intangible amortization and acquisition and integration charges.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $10.0
million in 2011 compared to $15.6 million in 2010, a 36% decline. The $15.6 million of interest expense in 2010 included $3.7
million of incremental expense related to the refinancing of our debt (See Note 5 — Debt in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements). Excluding the $3.7 million incremental charge, Interest expense, net declined
approximately 15% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding, which declined to $220.0
million in 2011 from $326.0 million in 2010.

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $(1.9)
million in 2011, which primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange losses, and $0.4 million in 2010, which consisted of
a $2.4 million gain from an insurance recovery related to a prior period loss, offset by net foreign currency exchange losses.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $65.3 million
in 2011 compared to $37.8 million in 2010 and the effective tax rate was 32.3% for 2011 compared to 28.2% for 2010. The lower effective
tax rate in 2010 was primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowances relating to certain net operating losses.

NET INCOME was $136.9 million in 2011 and
$96.3 million in 2010, an increase of $40.6 million, or 42%, primarily due to a substantially higher operating income, which was
partially offset by higher income tax charges. Basic earnings per share increased 42% year-over-year while diluted earnings per
share increased 45% due to the higher net income.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment
performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income
excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration
charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of
revenues.

2012 VERSUS 2011

Research segment revenues increased 12%
in 2012 compared to 2011 but excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation, Research segment revenues increased
14%. The segment gross contribution margin increased by 1 point, driven by higher revenues and the operating leverage in this business.
Contribution margin improved in spite of a 10% increase in segment headcount as we continue to invest for future growth.

Research contract value increased 13% in
2012, to $1,262.9 million, but increased 14% year-over-year excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. We
had double-digit contract value growth across all of our Research product lines and client sizes, and almost every industry group.
The number of research client organizations we serve increased by 7% in 2012, to 13,305, and has increased 27% since 2009. We attribute
the increase in contract value and the number of client organizations we serve to our extraordinary research content, our continuing
focus on sales effectiveness, and the expansion in the number of our quota-bearing sales associates. Both client retention and
wallet retention remained strong during 2012 at 83% and 99%, respectively.


2011 VERSUS 2010

Research segment revenues increased 17%
in 2011 compared to 2010 and reached the one billion dollar level for the first time. Excluding the favorable effect of foreign
currency translation, Research segment revenues increased 14%. The segment gross contribution margin increased by 2 points, to
67%, as higher segment revenues and the operating leverage in this business resulted in a higher segment contribution. Research
contract value increased 14% in 2011, to $1,115.8 million. Foreign currency translation had an immaterial impact year-over-year
on contract value. We had double-digit contract value growth in most of our Research product lines, client sizes, and industry
groups. Client retention and wallet retention remained strong at 82% and 99%, respectively.

2012 VERSUS

Consulting revenues decreased 1% year-over-year
due to lower revenues in our contract optimization business. Contract optimization revenues, which can fluctuate from period to period,
currently represent about 10% of total Consulting segment revenues and have been declining over time as a percentage of overall segment revenue.
The decrease in contract optimization revenue was substantially offset
by higher core consulting revenues, which increased 5% year-over-year, driven by additional demand and increased headcount. Strategic
advisory (“SAS”) revenues were flat year-over-year, in accordance with our segment plan. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 1% year-over-year. The
gross contribution margin declined by 1 point due to the lower revenues in our contract optimization business, which has a higher
contribution margin than core consulting or SAS. Backlog increased 2% year-over-year, to $102.7 million at December 31, 2012.

2011 VERSUS

Consulting revenues increased
2% year-over-year primarily due to higher revenues in core consulting. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency
translation, revenues were down slightly. The gross contribution margin declined by 3 points, due to lower utilization in
core consulting and higher payroll and benefit costs resulting from merit salary increases and the full year impact in 2011
from the additional headcount we added in the fourth quarter of 2010. Backlog was down slightly year-over-year, to $100.6
million at December 31, 2011.

2012 VERSUS 2011

Events revenues increased 17% year-over-year,
or $25.3 million, but excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 20% year-over-year.
We held 62 events in 2012 compared to 60 in 2011. The 62 events held in 2012 consisted of 57 ongoing events and 5 new event launches,
with 3 events held in prior years discontinued, while the overall number of attendees and exhibitors increased 8% and 20%, respectively.
Average revenue per attendee rose 3% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 1%. Both the additional revenue and the higher
contribution margin in 2012 were primarily due to the significantly higher exhibitor volume at our ongoing events.

2011 VERSUS 2010

Events revenues increased 22% year-over-year,
or $27.1 million. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 21%. We held 60 events in
2011, which consisted of 53 ongoing events and 7 new event launches, compared to 56 events in 2010. We discontinued 3 events in
2011 that had been held in prior years. The additional revenue we earned in 2011 was attributable to significantly higher revenue
at our ongoing events, with double-digit increases in the number of attendees and exhibitors. Average revenue per attendee rose
2% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 5%. For full year 2011, gross contribution margin decreased 1 point, primarily due
to incremental expenses and additional investment in the business to strengthen the portfolio and provide a foundation for future
growth.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations primarily
through cash generated from our operating activities. For 2012, we had operating cash flow of $279.8 million, which was the
highest in the Company’s history and an increase of 9% over 2011. Our operating cash flow has been continuously
enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model as well as our focus on operational
efficiencies. Revenues in our Research segment, which increased 12% in 2012 compared to 2011, constituted 70% and 69% of our
total revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our Research contracts generally renew annually and typically are paid in
advance, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has generally resulted in strong
growth in operating cash flow each year. Our cash flow generation has also been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve
the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as the effective management of our working capital as we increase our
sales volume.

In addition to the strong increase in our
operating cash flows, we also had almost $300.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2012, which was the highest cash
balance in the Company’s history, and $347.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility
at year-end 2012. We believe that our strong operating cash flow, as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing
capacity, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs.

The Company’s 2010
Credit Agreement expires in December 2015. The Company is currently exploring refinancing options to take advantage of
favorable market conditions.

Our cash and cash equivalents are held
in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2012, approximately $167.0 million of our cash was held outside the
U.S. Approximately half of the amount of cash held overseas represents unremitted earnings of our non-U.S subsidiaries. Under U.S.
accounting rules, no provision for U.S. federal and local taxes is required for these unremitted overseas earnings if the Company
intends to reinvest such funds overseas. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings
to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S operations, and as a result we intend to reinvest
these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal
additional tax. As a result, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been recorded for these unremitted earnings.
However, should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings, we may be required
to accrue for U.S. taxes as a result, and these charges could be material and would be recorded in future periods.

2012 VERSUS 2011

Operating

Operating cash flow increased by 9%, or
$24.2 million, in 2012 compared to 2011, which was primarily due to higher net income. We also had lower cash payments for interest
on our debt and other items, as well as higher cash reimbursements related to the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility.
These increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash payments for income taxes during 2012.

Investing

Cash used for investing purposes was $54.7
million in 2012, an increase in cash used of $12.7 million compared to 2011, due to $10.3 million of cash used for the acquisition
of Ideas International and higher capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures were $44.3 million
in 2012 compared to $42.0 million in 2011, which included $17.0 million and $9.5 million, respectively, which we paid for the renovation
of our Stamford headquarters facility. Up to $25.0 million of these expenditures are reimbursable by the facility landlord, and
$13.0 million was reimbursed in 2012 and $9.0 million in 2011. The reimbursements are included in operating cash flows.

Financing

We used $114.0 million less cash in our
financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a lower number of shares repurchased. Cash used for share repurchases
was $111.3 million in 2012 compared to $212.0 million in 2011, with 2.7 million and 5.9 million of shares repurchased, respectively.
Cash used also declined due to net debt activity, as we borrowed an additional $5.0 million in 2012 compared to $20.1 million of
debt repayments in 2011.

2011 VERSUS 2010

Operating

Operating cash flow increased by 24%, or
$50.1 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to $40.6 million in higher net income and lower cash payments
for acquisition costs, severance, and other costs. We also received $9.0 million in landlord cash reimbursements for capital expenditures
on the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility. These increased cash flows were partially offset by higher cash bonus
and commission payments we paid in 2011 due to our stronger financial performance.

Investing

We used $8.1 million of additional cash
in our investing activities in 2011 compared to 2010, due to higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $42.0 million
in 2011 compared to $21.7 million in 2010. We also made $12.2 million in payments related to the acquisition of Burton Group in
early 2010, which we acquired in December 2009. The $42.0 million of capital expenditures in the 2011 period included $9.5 million
we paid for the renovation of our Stamford headquarters facility, which is fully reimbursable by the landlord. The Company received
reimbursement of $9.0 million of this amount in 2011.

Financing

We used an additional $15.0 million of
cash in our financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to additional share repurchases. During 2011, we used
$212.0 million for share repurchases, compared to $99.8 million in 2010. The increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2011
was substantially offset by lower debt repayments in 2011 compared to 2010. On a net basis, we repaid $99.8 million of debt in
2010 and we paid $4.8 million in fees related to our refinancing, compared to $20.1 million of debt repayments in 2011.


OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

At December 31, 2012, we had $200.0 million
outstanding under our 2010 Credit Agreement which provides for a five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving
credit facility. The 2010 Credit Agreement contains an expansion feature by which the term loan and revolving credit facility may
be increased, at the Company’s option and under certain conditions, by up to an additional $150.0 million in the aggregate.
The term loan will be repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments with the final payment due in December 2015, and may be prepaid
at any time without penalty or premium at the Company’s option. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and
up to $40.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until December
2015, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 5 — Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding the 2010 Credit Agreement.

Includes both the term and revolver principal amounts borrowed under the Company’s 2010 Credit Agreement, which matures in December 2015(see Note 5 — Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), as well as estimated interest payments. Amounts borrowed under the term loan arrangement have been classified in the table based on the scheduled repayment dates, while revolver borrowings are classified in the Due In 2-3 Years category since the amounts are not contractually due until December 2015. Also included is the $5.0 million the Company borrowed in December 2012 under a State of Connecticut economic development program which has a 10 year maturity and is included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category.

Interest payments on amounts outstanding under the 2010 Credit Facility are based on a floating rate. However, the Company has a $200.0 million notional interest rate swap that converts the variable interest payments on the debt to a 2.26% fixed rate on the first $200.0 million of borrowings. As a result, in order to calculate an estimate for the future interest payments, the Company has used a rate of 3.76%, which includes the swap rate of 2.26% plus a loan margin of 1.50%, for the 2010 Credit Facility.

(2)

The Company leases various facilities, furniture, autos, and computer equipment. These leases expire between 2013 and 2027 (see Note 1 — Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).

(3)

Represents the Company’s liability to participants in its supplemental deferred compensation arrangement (see Note 13 — Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Amounts payable to active employees whose payment date is unknown have been included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category since the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid.

(4)

Includes interest and penalties. In addition to the $2.2 million tax liability, $16.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities, and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table, the Company has also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $3.4 million.

(5)

Includes contractual commitments for software, building maintenance, and telecom services.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The FASB has issued new accounting rules
which have not yet become effective. These new rules are described below, together with our assessment of the potential impact
they may have on our financial statements and related disclosures in future periods:

Other Comprehensive Income Reclassifications

.
In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
No. 2013-02,

Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

. The standard requires that
public companies present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial
statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. Public companies will also have to provide this information
in both their annual and interim financial statements. The new requirements will take effect for Gartner beginning January 1, 2013
and will be applied prospectively. 	While the Company has not completed its analysis of the new standard, it believes the new
rule may result in additional disclosures and changes to the presentation of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Balance Sheet
Offsetting

. In December 2011, the

FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-11,

Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities

. The new guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are offset or have the potential
to be offset under U.S. GAAP rules. The new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information
about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments
and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. In addition, the standard requires disclosure
of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements. These disclosures are intended
to address differences in the asset and liability offsetting requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards. This new guidance will be effective for Gartner for interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013,
with retrospective application required. While the adoption of this new guidance may result in additional disclosures, we do not
expect it to have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The FASB also continues to work on a number
of significant accounting rules which may impact the Company’s accounting and disclosures in future periods. Since these
rules have not yet been issued, the effective dates and potential impact are unknown.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.

INTEREST RATE RISK

We have exposure to changes in interest
rates arising from borrowings under our 2010 Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2012, we had $150.0 million outstanding under the
term loan and $50.0 million outstanding under the revolver. Borrowings under this facility are floating rate, which may be either
prime-based or Eurodollar-based. The rate paid for these borrowings includes a base floating rate plus a margin between 0.50% and
1.25% on prime borrowings and between 1.50% and 2.25% on Eurodollar-based borrowings.

We have an interest rate swap
contract which effectively converts the floating base rate on the first $200.0 million of our borrowings to a 2.26% fixed
rate. The Company only hedges the base interest rate risk on the first $200.0 million of its outstanding borrowings.
Accordingly, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings in excess of $200.0 million. A 25 basis point increase or
decrease in interest rates could change pre-tax annual interest expense on the additional revolver borrowing capacity under
the 2010 Credit Agreement (not including the expansion feature) by approximately $0.9 million.


FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

Approximately 46% of our revenues for both
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were derived from sales outside of the U.S. As a result, we conduct business
in numerous currencies other than the U.S dollar. Among the major foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the Eurodollar,
the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar. Our foreign currency exposure results in both
translation risk and transaction risk:

TRANSLATION RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency translation
risk since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency. Translation risk
arises since the assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, and these exchange rates fluctuate over time. These foreign currency translation adjustments
are deferred and are recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not impact our operating results.

A measure of the potential impact of foreign
currency translation on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets can be determined through a sensitivity analysis of our cash
and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2012, we had almost $300.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, with approximately half
denominated in foreign currencies. If the foreign exchange rates of the major currencies in which we operate changed in comparison
to the U.S. dollar by 10%, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would have reported on December 31, 2012 would have increased
or decreased by approximately $12.0 million.

Because our foreign subsidiaries generally
operate in a local functional currency that differs from the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses in these foreign currencies translate
into higher or lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the U.S. dollar continuously weakens or strengthens against these
other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S.
dollars) from foreign operations. Historically, this impact on our consolidated earnings has not been material since foreign currency
movements in the major currencies in which we operate tend to impact our revenues and expenses fairly equally.

TRANSACTION RISK

We also have foreign exchange transaction
risk since foreign subsidiaries typically enter into transactions in the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign
currencies that differ from the local functional currency in which the foreign subsidiary operates. We may enter into foreign currency
forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of foreign currency transaction risk. These contracts are normally short term
in duration and unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized in current period earnings. At December 31, 2012, we had
68 outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a total notional amount of $76.1 million and an immaterial net unrealized
gain. All of these contracts matured by the end of January 2013.

CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments classified as cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and interest rate swap contracts. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents
and its interest rate swap contracts are with large investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the Company’s
2010 Credit Agreement. Accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit
risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Our consolidated financial statements for
2012, 2011, and 2010, together with the reports of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, are included herein
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management conducted an evaluation,
as of December 31, 2012, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a- 15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
Act”)) under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material Company information required to be
disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Act.


MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING

Gartner management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Gartner’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management’s
assessment was reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Based on its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, Gartner’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of management’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part IV, Item 15.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

There were no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed
an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries’
(the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control
— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established
in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2012, and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements.

GARTNER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 — BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Business.

Gartner, Inc. is a global
information technology research and advisory company founded in 1979 with its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Gartner delivers
its principal products and services through three business segments: Research, Consulting, and Events. When used in these notes,
the terms “Gartner,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Gartner,
Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation.

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 270 for financial information and with the applicable instructions of U.S. Securities
& Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Regulation S-X. The fiscal year of Gartner represents the twelve-month period from
January 1 through December 31. All references to 2012, 2011, and 2010 herein refer to the fiscal year unless otherwise indicated.

Principles of consolidation.

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Use of estimates.

The preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent
assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable,
goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, as well as tax accruals and other liabilities. In addition, estimates
are used in revenue recognition, income tax expense, performance-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization, and
the allowance for losses. Management believes its use of estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to be
reasonable.

Management continuously evaluates and revises
its estimates using historical experience and other factors, including the general economic environment and actions it may take
in the future. Management adjusts these estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant
uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on management’s
best judgment at a point in time. As a result, differences between our estimates and actual results could be material and would
be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future periods.

Revenues.

Revenue is recognized
in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,

Revenue Recognition

in Financial Statements (“SAB
101”), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB 104”). Revenues are only recognized
once all required criteria for recognition have been met. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations presents revenues
net of any sales or value-added taxes that we collect from customers and remit to government authorities.

The Company’s revenues by significant
source are as follows:

Research

Research revenues are derived from annual
subscription contracts for research products. These revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term.
The Company typically enters into annually renewable subscription contracts for research products. Reprint fees are recognized
when the reprint is shipped.

The majority of research contracts are
billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. Research contracts are non-cancelable
and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which historically have
not produced material cancellations. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable
at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable
claim.

Consulting

Consulting revenues, primarily derived
from consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services (paid one-day analyst engagements), are principally generated from
fixed fee or time and materials engagements. Revenues from fixed fee engagements are recognized on a proportional performance basis,
while revenues from time and material engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related
to contract optimization engagements are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related
to their payment. Unbilled fees receivable associated with consulting engagements were $34.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $29.2
million at December 31, 2011.


Events

Events revenues are deferred and recognized
upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. In addition, the Company defers certain costs directly
related to events and expenses these costs in the period during which the related symposium, conference or exhibition occurs. The
Company policy is to defer only those costs, primarily prepaid site and production services costs, which are incremental and are
directly attributable to a specific event. Other costs of organizing and producing our events, primarily Company personnel and
non-event specific expenses, are expensed in the period incurred. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company assesses on an
event-by-event basis whether expected direct costs of producing a scheduled event will exceed expected revenues. If such costs
are expected to exceed revenues, the Company records the expected loss in the period determined.

Allowance for losses.

The Company
maintains an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against
earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or as an increase to expense. The amount of the allowance for losses is based on historical
loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, our assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific
clients.

Cost of services and product development
(“COS”).

COS expense includes the direct costs incurred in the creation and delivery of our products and services.

Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”).

SG&A expense includes direct and indirect selling costs, general and administrative costs, and
charges against earnings related to uncollectible accounts.

Commission expense.

The Company
records commission obligations upon the signing of customer contracts and amortizes the deferred obligation as commission expense
over the period in which the related revenues are earned. Commission expense is included in SG&A in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

Stock-based compensation expense.

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletins No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”) and No. 110 (“SAB No. 110”). Stock-based compensation cost is based on
the fair value of the award on the date of grant, which is expensed over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
The service period is the period over which the employee performs the related services, which is normally the same as the vesting
period. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company recognized $36.4 million, $32.9 million, and $32.6 million, respectively, of stock-based
compensation expense (see Note 8 — Stock-Based Compensation), which is recorded in both COS and SG&A in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Income tax expense.

As we prepare
our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process
involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of
items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within
our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in
question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that
we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment is made to reduce
the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not
be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged
against income in the period such determination is made.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Includes
cash and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are considered cash equivalents.
The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity. Investments with maturities of
more than three months are classified as marketable securities. Interest earned is classified in Interest income in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements.

The Company leases all of its facilities and certain equipment. These leases are all classified as operating leases in accordance
with FASB ASC Topic 840. The cost of these operating leases, including any contractual rent increases, rent concessions, and landlord
incentives, are recognized ratably over the life of the related lease agreement. Lease expense was $30.3 million, $26.2 million,
and $23.5 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Equipment, leasehold improvements, and
other fixed assets owned by the Company are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Except for leasehold improvements,
these fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements
are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining
term of the related leases. The Company had total depreciation expense of $25.4 million, $25.5 million, and $25.3 million in 2012,
2011, and 2010, respectively.

The Company incurs costs to develop internal
use software used in our operations, and certain costs meeting the criteria outlined in FASB ASC Topic 350 are capitalized and
amortized over future periods. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, net capitalized development costs for internal use software were
$14.4 million and $13.6 million, respectively. Amortization of capitalized internal software development costs, which is classified
in Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, totaled $7.4 million, $7.8 million, and $7.9 million during 2012,
2011, and 2010, respectively.

Stamford headquarters lease renewal

The Company’s corporate headquarters
is located in 213,000 square feet of leased office space in three buildings in Stamford, Connecticut. The Stamford facility accommodates
research and analysis, marketing, sales, client support, production, corporate services, executive offices, and administration.
In 2010 the Company entered into a new 15 year lease agreement for this facility which provides for a reduced rental until completion
of certain renovation work. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 840, the Company accounted for the new Stamford lease as an operating
lease arrangement. The total minimum payments the Company is obligated to pay under this lease, including contractual escalation
clauses and reduced rents during the renovation period, are being expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Under this arrangement, the landlord has
provided a $25.0 million tenant improvement allowance to be used to renovate the three buildings. The renovation work began in
2011 and is expected to be completed in early 2013. The $25.0 million contractual amount due from the landlord was recorded as
a tenant improvement allowance in Other assets and as deferred rent in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As
the renovation work progresses and payments are received from the landlord, the tenant improvement receivable is relieved and leasehold
improvement assets are recorded in Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements. The leasehold improvement assets are being
amortized to Depreciation expense over their useful lives, beginning when the assets are placed in service. The amount recorded
as deferred rent is being amortized as a reduction to rent expense (SG&A) on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had
$21.0 million of remaining unamortized deferred rent resulting from the tenant improvement allowance, of which $1.5 million is
recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $19.5 million is recorded in Other liabilities on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company paid $17.0 million and $9.5 million in renovation costs for this project in 2012 and 2011,
respectively, which are classified as cash outflows in the Investing activities section of the Company’s Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows. The Company received landlord cash reimbursements for these expenditures of $13.0 million and $9.0 million in 2012
and 2011, respectively, which are classified as cash inflows in the Operating activities section of the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.

Intangible assets.

The Company has
amortizable intangible assets which are amortized against earnings using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives.
Changes in intangible assets subject to amortization during the two year period ended December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):

Goodwill.

Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net
assets acquired. The evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill is performed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, which requires
an annual assessment of potential goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill
can be based on either a qualitative or qualitative assessment or a combination of the two. Both methods utilize estimates which
in turn require judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of
the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty.

The Company conducted a qualitative assessment
of the fair value of its three reporting units as of September 30, 2012 based in part on the demonstrated historical trend of the
fair values of the Company’s reporting units substantially exceeding their carrying values and its recent financial performance.
Among the factors included in the Company’s qualitative assessment were general economic conditions and the competitive environment;
actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments.
Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, the Company believes the fair values of its reporting units continue to substantially
exceed their respective carrying values.

the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit during the two year period ended December 31, 2012 (in thousands):

(2)

The Company acquired Ideas International in mid-2012 and recorded $7.5 million of goodwill. All

above for additional information.

Impairment of long-lived and intangible
assets.

The Company reviews its long-lived and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable. Such evaluation may be based
on a number of factors including current and projected operating results and cash flows, changes in management’s strategic
direction as well as external economic and market factors. The Company’s policy regarding long-lived assets and intangible
assets other than goodwill is to evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Should events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be
recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized. The


amount of impairment, if any, is measured
based on the difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company’s
average cost of funds and the carrying value of the asset. The Company did not record any material impairment charges for long-lived
and intangible assets during 2012, 2011, or 2010.

Pension obligations.

The Company
has defined-benefit pension plans in several of its international locations (see Note 13 — Employee Benefits). Benefits earned
under these plans are generally based on years of service and level of employee compensation. The Company accounts for defined
benefit plans in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 715. The Company determines the periodic pension expense and
related liabilities for these plans through actuarial assumptions and valuations. The Company recognized $2.6 million, $2.7 million,
and $2.4 million of expense for these plans in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Company classifies pension expense in SG&A
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Debt.

The Company presents amounts
borrowed in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at amortized cost. Accrued interest on amounts borrowed is classified in Interest expense
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $205.0 million and $200.0 million of debt outstanding at December
31, 2012 and 2011. See Note 5—Debt for additional information regarding the Company’s debt.

Foreign currency exposure.

All assets
and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded
as foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net within the Stockholders’
equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Currency transaction gains or losses arising
from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary are recognized in results of operations
in Other (expense) income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net currency transaction (losses) were $(2.3)
million, $(1.3) million, and $(4.8) million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Company enters into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on these transactions. These
contracts generally have a short duration and are recorded at fair value with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded
in Other (expense) income, net. The net gain (loss) from these contracts was $0.6 million, $(1.2) million, and $2.8 million in
2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Comprehensive income.

On January
1, 2012, the Company retrospectively adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-05,

Comprehensive
Income (Topic 220-10): Presentation of Comprehensive Income,

and a related amendment. Comprehensive income includes income
and expense items from nonowner sources and consists of two separate components: net income as reported and other comprehensive
income. ASU No. 2011-05 eliminates the option to report comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders’
equity. Instead, the new rule optionally requires the presentation of net income and comprehensive income in one continuous statement,
or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The Company has presented net income, other comprehensive income and its components,
and comprehensive income in a new, separate statement called the

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income,

which
is included herein

.

While the Company’s presentation of comprehensive income has changed, there were no changes to
the components or amounts that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing accounting guidance. As
a result, the adoption of this new rule did not impact the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No.
2013-02,

Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,

which

updates ASU No. 2011-05. The standard requires that public companies present information about reclassification adjustments
from accumulated other comprehensive income in their financial statements in a single note or on the face of the financial statements.
Public companies will have to provide this information in both their annual and interim financial statements. The new requirements
will take effect for Gartner beginning January 1, 2013 and will be applied prospectively. 	While the Company has not completed
its analysis of the new standard, it believes the new rule may result in additional disclosures and changes to the presentation
of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Fair value disclosures.

The Company
has a limited number of assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date. The Company’s
fair value disclosures are included in Note 12 — Fair Value Disclosures.

Concentrations of credit risk.

Assets
that may subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments classified
as cash equivalents, accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, and a pension reinsurance asset. The majority of the Company’s
cash equivalent investments and its interest rate swap contract are with investment grade commercial banks that are participants
in the Company’s credit facility. Accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited concentration
of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion. The Company’s pension reinsurance asset (see Note
13 — Employee Benefits) is maintained with a large international insurance company that was rated investment grade as of
December 31, 2012.

Stock repurchase programs.

The Company
records the cost to repurchase its own common shares to treasury stock. During 2012, 2011 and 2010 the Company recorded $111.3
million, $212.0 million, and $99.8 million, respectively, of stock repurchases (see Note 7 — Stockholders’ Equity).
Shares repurchased by the Company are added to treasury shares and are not retired.


Recent accounting developments.

Accounting
rules that have been issued by the FASB that have not yet become effective and that may impact the Company’s consolidated
financial statements or related disclosures in future periods are described below:

Balance sheet
offsetting.

In December 2011, the

FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-11,

Disclosures about Offsetting
Assets and Liabilities

. The new guidance requires disclosures about assets and liabilities that are offset or have the potential
to be offset under U.S. GAAP rules. These disclosures are intended to address differences in the asset and liability offsetting
requirements under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The new disclosure requirements mandate that entities
disclose both gross and net information about financial instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial
position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. In addition,
the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements.
However, as of year-end 2012, the FASB is considering certain amendments to ASU No. 2011-11 which may limit the scope of the new
rules. ASU No. 2011-11 will be effective for Gartner for interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, with retrospective
application required. While the adoption of this new guidance may result in additional disclosures, we do not expect it to have
an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other comprehensive income disclosures.

Comprehensive Income

2 — ACQUISITIONS


In May 2012 the Company acquired Ideas
International Limited (“Ideas International”), a publicly-owned Australian corporation (ASX: IDE) headquartered outside
of Sydney with 40 employees. Ideas International provided intelligence on IT infrastructure configurations and pricing data to
IT professionals and vendors. The Company paid aggregate cash consideration of $18.8 million for 100% of the outstanding shares
of Ideas International. The Company’s strategic objectives in acquiring Ideas International are to leverage Gartner’s
scale and worldwide distribution capability, introduce Ideas International’s products and services to Gartner’s much
larger end user client base, and further penetrate the technology vendor market. Ideas International’s business operations
have been integrated into the Company’s Research segment.

Gartner’s financial statements include
the operating results of Ideas International beginning with the date of acquisition. These results were not material to the Company’s
2012 results. The Company recorded $2.4 million of pre-tax acquisition and integration charges for this acquisition in 2012, which
is classified in Acquisition and integration charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in these charges are
legal, consulting, and severance costs, all of which were direct and incremental charges from the acquisition. Had the Company
acquired Ideas International on January 1, 2010, the impact to the Company’s operating results for 2011 and 2010 would not
have been material, and as a result pro forma financial information for those periods has not been presented.

The acquisition was accounted for under
the acquisition method of accounting as prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 805,

Business Combinations.

The acquisition method
of accounting requires the consideration paid to be allocated to the net assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated
fair values as of the acquisition date, and any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired,
including identifiable intangible assets, must be allocated to goodwill. The Company considers its allocation of the respective
purchase price to be preliminary, particularly with respect to the valuation of certain tax related items. In accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 805, a final determination of the purchase price allocation and resulting goodwill must be made within one year of the
acquisition date. The Company anticipates that none of the recorded goodwill arising from the acquisition will be deductible for
tax purposes. All of the recorded goodwill was included in the Company’s Research segment. The Company believes the recorded
goodwill is supported by the anticipated revenues related to the acquisition.

The following table summarizes the preliminary
allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition (dollars in
thousands):

obligations was determined by estimating the costs to provide the services plus a normal profit margin, and did not include costs
associated with selling efforts.


The Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of AMR Research and Burton Group in 2009 for total net cash of $116.7 million, of which $12.2 million was paid in 2010 and
$104.5 million was paid in 2009. The Company recorded $7.9 million of acquisition and integration expenses related to these acquisitions
during 2010.

2010 Credit Agreement

The Company has a credit arrangement that
provides for a five-year, $200.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility which it entered into in December
2010 (the “2010 Credit Agreement”). The Company terminated its prior credit arrangement when it entered into the 2010
Credit Agreement and paid down the remaining amounts outstanding. The 2010 Credit Agreement contains an expansion feature by which
the term loan and revolving credit facility may be increased, at the Company’s option and under certain conditions, by up
to an additional $150.0 million in the aggregate. The term loan is being repaid in 19 consecutive quarterly installments which
commenced on March 31, 2011, plus a final payment due on December 22, 2015, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium
at the Company’s option. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $40.0 million may be used for letters
of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed until December 22, 2015, at which time all amounts borrowed
must be repaid.

Amounts borrowed under the 2010 Credit
Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (i) the greatest of: the administrative agent’s
prime rate; the average rate on overnight federal funds plus 1/2 of 1%; and the eurodollar rate (adjusted for statutory reserves)
plus 1%, in each case plus a margin equal to between 0.50% and 1.25% depending on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the
end of the four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended, or (ii) the eurodollar rate (adjusted for statutory reserves)
plus a margin equal to between 1.50% and 2.25%, depending on the Company’s leverage ratio as of the end of the four consecutive
fiscal quarters most recently ended.

The 2010 Credit Agreement contains certain
customary restrictive loan covenants, including, among others, financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum
interest expense coverage ratio, and covenants limiting the Company’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions,
be acquired, dispose of assets, pay dividends, repurchase stock, make capital expenditures, make investments and enter into certain
transactions with affiliates. The Company was in full compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2012.

In December 2010, the Company recorded
certain incremental pre-tax charges due to the termination of the prior credit arrangement. The majority of these charges would
have been recognized as expenses in 2011, but accounting rules required their accelerated recognition in 2010. These accelerated
pre-tax charges included $3.3 million for deferred losses on interest rate swap contracts that had been recorded in Other Comprehensive
Income (OCI) since the swaps had previously been designated as accounting hedges, and $0.4 million for the write-off of a portion
of capitalized debt issuance costs related to the previous debt. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, the deferral of the unrealized
losses on the swaps recorded in OCI was no longer permitted since the forecasted interest payments related to the previous debt
would not occur. Both the capitalized debt issuance write-off and the interest rate swap charge were classified in Interest expense
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Both the term and revolver loan rates consisted of a floating
Eurodollar base rate of 0.31% plus a margin of 1.5%. However, the Company has an interest rate swap contract which converts the
floating Eurodollar base rate to a 2.26% fixed base rate on the first $200.0 million of Company borrowings (see below). As a result,
the Company’s effective annual interest rate on the $200.0 million of outstanding debt under the 2010 Credit Facility as
of December 31, 2012, including the margin, was 3.76%.

(2)

The Company had $346.6 million of available borrowing capacity
on the revolver (not including the expansion feature) as of December 31, 2012.


(3)

In December 2012 the Company borrowed $5.0 million under
a previously disclosed financial assistance package provided by an economic development program through the State of Connecticut
in connection with the Company’s renovation of its Stamford headquarters facility. The loan has a 10 year maturity and bears
a 3% fixed rate of interest. Principal payments are deferred for the first five years and the loan may be repaid at any point
by the Company without penalty. The loan has a principal forgiveness provision in which up to $2.5 million of the loan may be
forgiven if the Company meets certain employment targets in the State of Connecticut during the first five years of the loan.

Interest
Rate Swap Hedge

The Company entered into a $200.0 million
notional fixed-for-floating interest rate swap contract in December 2010 which it designated as a hedge of the forecasted interest
payments on the Company’s variable rate borrowings. Under the swap terms, the Company pays a base fixed rate of 2.26% and
in return receives a Eurodollar base rate.

The Company accounts for the interest rate
swap as a cash flow hedge in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815. Since the swap is hedging forecasted interest payments, changes
in the fair value of the swap are recorded in OCI as long as the swap continues to be a highly effective hedge of the designated
interest rate risk. Any ineffective portion of change in the fair value of the hedge is recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2012,
there was no ineffective portion of the hedge. The interest rate swap had a negative fair value to the Company of $10.0 million
at December 31, 2012, which is classified in OCI, net of tax effect.

Letters of Credit

The Company had $10.1 million of letters
of credit and related guarantees outstanding at year-end 2012. The Company issues these instruments in the ordinary course of business
to facilitate transactions with customers and others.

6 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Contractual Lease Commitments.

The
Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer and office equipment under operating lease arrangements expiring between
2013 and 2027. The future minimum annual cash payments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements at December 31, 2012, are

Legal Matters.

We are involved in
various legal and administrative proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of these individual
matters is not predictable at this time. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, after considering amounts
already accrued and insurance coverage, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows in future periods.

Indemnifications.

The Company has
various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification
clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or
certain intellectual property rights. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these
indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts of each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material. As of December 31, 2012, we did not
have any indemnification agreements that could require material payments.

7 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common stock.

Holders of Gartner’s
Common Stock, par value $.0005 per share (“Common Stock”) are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted
by stockholders. The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its Common Stock. Also, our credit arrangement contains a
negative covenant which may limit our ability to pay dividends.

shares repurchased directly from ValueAct was $75.2 million.

Share repurchase program.

The Company
has a $500.0 million share repurchase program, of which $210.2 million remained available for share repurchases as of December
31, 2012. Repurchases may be made from time-to-time through open market purchases, private transactions, tender offers or other
transactions. The amount and timing of repurchases will be subject to the availability of stock, prevailing market conditions,
the trading price of the stock, the Company’s financial performance and other conditions. Repurchases may also be made from
time-to-time in connection with the settlement of the Company’s shared-based compensation awards. Repurchases may be funded
from cash flow from operations or borrowings.

The Company paid cash of $111.3 million,
$212.0 million, and $99.8 million, in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively, for common stock repurchases. The $212.0 million paid
for share repurchases in 2011 includes the cost of the shares repurchased directly from ValueAct.

8 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company grants stock-based compensation
awards as an incentive for employees and directors to contribute to the Company’s long-term success. The Company currently
awards stock-settled stock appreciation rights, service-based and performance-based restricted stock units, and common stock equivalents.
At December 31, 2012, the Company had 6.4 million shares of Common Stock available for awards of stock-based compensation under
its 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topics 505 and 718, as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 (“SAB No.
107”) and No. 110 (“SAB No. 110”). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on
the date of grant, which is then recognized as expense over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The service
period is the period over which the related service is performed, which is generally the same as the vesting period. Currently
the Company issues treasury shares upon the exercise, release or settlement of stock-based compensation awards.

Determining the appropriate fair value
model and calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions,
including the expected life of the stock-based compensation awards and the Common Stock price volatility. In addition, determining
the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the amount of employee forfeitures and the
likelihood of the achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based
compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the
future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company’s
stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock-based compensation
expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.

expense over the remaining weighted-average service period of approximately 2.2 years.

Stock-Based Compensation Awards

The following disclosures provide information
regarding the Company’s stock-based compensation awards, all of which are classified as equity awards in accordance with
FASB ASC Topic 505:

Stock Appreciation Rights

Stock-settled stock appreciation rights
(SARs) permit the holder to participate in the appreciation of the Common Stock. SARs are settled in shares of Common Stock by
the employee once the applicable vesting criteria have been met. SARs vest ratably over a four-year service period and expire seven
years from the grant date. The fair value of SARs awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over four
years. SARs have only been awarded to the Company’s executive officers.

When SARs are exercised, the number of
shares of Common Stock issued is calculated as follows: (1) the total proceeds from the SARs exercise (calculated as the closing
price of the Common Stock on the date of exercise less the exercise price of the SARs, multiplied by the number of SARs exercised)
is divided by (2) the closing price of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the exercise date. The Company
withholds a portion of the shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
SARs recipients do not have any stockholder rights until after actual shares of Common Stock are issued in respect of the award,
which is subject to the prior satisfaction of the vesting and other criteria relating to such grants.

At December 31, 2012, 1.2 million of these SARs were unvested.
The Company expects that substantially all of these unvested awards will vest in future periods.

(2)

At December 31, 2012, SARs outstanding had an intrinsic
value of $42.9 million. SARs vested and exercisable had an intrinsic value of $23.1 million.

The fair value of the SARs granted was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions for
the years ended December 31:

(1)

The dividend yield assumption is based on both the history
and expectation of the Company’s dividend payouts. Historically the Company has not paid cash dividends on its Common Stock.

(2)

The determination of expected stock price volatility was
based on both historical Common Stock prices and the implied volatility from publicly traded options in Common Stock.

(3)

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a
U.S. Treasury security with a maturity similar to the expected life of the award.

(4)

The expected life represents the Company’s weighted-average
estimate of the period of time the SARs are expected to be outstanding (that is, the period between the service inception date
and the expected exercise date). Beginning January 1, 2012, the expected life has been calculated based on the Company’s
historical exercise data. Previously, the Company determined the expected life based on a simplified calculation permitted by
SEC SAB No. 107 and SAB No. 110 since the necessary historical exercise data was not available. The change in methodology had
an insignificant impact on the calculation of the expected life.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units (RSUs) give the
awardee the right to receive shares of Common Stock when the vesting conditions are met and the restrictions lapse, and each RSU
that vests entitles the awardee to one common share. RSU awardees do not have any of the right of a Gartner stockholder, including
voting rights and the right to receive dividends and distributions, until the shares are released.

The fair value of RSUs is determined on
the date of grant based on the closing price of the Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on that date. Service-based
RSUs vest ratably over four years and are expensed on a straight-line basis over four years. Performance-based RSUs are subject
to both performance and service conditions, vest ratably over four years, and are expensed on an accelerated basis.

The following table summarizes the changes

The 0.7 million RSUs granted in 2012 consisted of 0.3 million performance-based RSUs awarded to
executives and 0.4 million service-based RSUs awarded to non-executive employees and certain board members. The 0.3 million performance-based
RSUs awarded to executive personnel represented the target amount of the RSU award for the year, which was tied to an increase
in the Company’s subscription-based Research contract value (“CV”) for 2012. The final number of performance-based
RSUs granted could range from 0% to 200% of the target amount, with the final amount dependent on the actual increase in CV for
the year as measured on December 31, 2012. The actual CV increase achieved for 2012 was 104.3% of the targeted amount, which resulted
in the grant of 0.3 million performance-based RSUs to executives.

(2)

The Company expects that substantially all of the outstanding awards at December 31, 2012 will
vest in future periods.

(3)

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the outstanding RSUs is approximately 0.9 years.

Common Stock Equivalents

Common stock equivalents (CSEs) are convertible
into Common Stock and each CSE entitles the holder to one common share. Members of our Board of Directors receive directors’
fees payable in CSEs unless they opt to receive up to 50% of the fees in cash. Generally, the CSEs have no defined term and are
converted into common shares when service as the director terminates unless the director has elected an accelerated release. The
fair value of the CSEs is determined on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Common Stock as reported by the New
York Stock Exchange on that date. CSEs vest immediately and as a result are recorded as expense on the date of grant.

$8.6 million, $16.6 million, and $20.7 million in cash from stock option exercises in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase
plan (the “ESP Plan”) under which eligible employees are permitted to purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions,
which may not exceed 10% of an employee’s compensation (or $23,750 in any calendar year), at a price equal to 95% of the
closing price of the Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange at the end of each offering period. At December 31,
2012, the Company had approximately 1.3 million shares available for purchase under the ESP Plan. The ESP Plan is considered non-compensatory
under FASB ASC Topic 718, and as a result the Company does not record stock-based compensation expense for employee share purchases.
The Company received $3.8 million, $3.4 million, and $2.8 million in cash from share purchases under the ESP Plan during 2012,
2011, and 2010, respectively.

9 — COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER
SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in earnings. When the impact of common share equivalents is
antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation
of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations (in thousands, except per share amounts) for the years ended December
31:

Current net deferred tax assets and current
net deferred tax liabilities were $32.6 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and $31.4 million and $0.6 million as
of December 31, 2011, respectively, and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long-term net deferred tax assets and long-term net deferred tax liabilities were
$22.5 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2012 and $22.8 million and zero as of December 31, 2011, respectively, and
are included in Other assets and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. It is more likely than not that the results
of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.

The valuation allowances of $1.9 million
as of December 31, 2012 and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2011, respectively, largely relates to net operating losses.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company
had state and local tax net operating loss carryforwards of $108.8 million, of which $3.3 million expire within one to five
years, $99.7 million expire within six to fifteen years, and $5.8 million expire within sixteen to twenty years. In addition, the
Company had non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $30.6 million, of which $2.1 million expire over the next 20 years and
$28.5 million can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2012 the Company also had foreign tax credit carryforwards
of $6.7 million, the majority of which expire in 2018.

In 2012 state income taxes, net of federal
tax benefit include approximately $2.6 million of benefit relating to economic development tax credits associated with the renovation
of the Company’s Stamford headquarters facility.

As of December 31, 2012 and December 31
2011, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $17.6 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily
attributable to reductions for tax positions of prior years and settlements resulting from closure of tax audits, partially offset
by additions in unrecognized tax benefits attributable to 2012. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits
will be decreased by $4.5 million within the next 12 months due to anticipated closure of audits and the expiration of certain
statutes of limitation. The unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to the utilization of certain tax attributes.

The Company classifies uncertain tax positions
not expected to be settled within one year as long term liabilities. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company
had $13.1 million and $15.4 million, respectively, related to long term uncertain tax positions included in Other Liabilities.

The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits in its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company had $4.6 million and
$4.8 million of accrued interest and penalties respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits. These amounts are in addition
to the gross unrecognized tax benefits noted above. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for years ending December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $0.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively.

Included in the balance of unrecognized
tax benefits at December 31, 2012 are potential benefits of $12.6 million that if recognized would reduce the effective tax rate
on income from continuing operations.

The number of years with open statutes
of limitation varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.  Generally, the Company’s statutes are open for tax years ended
December 31, 2007 and forward, with the exception of India which is open for tax years 2003 and forward. Major taxing jurisdictions
include the U.S. (federal and state), the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, India, and Ireland.

During 2012, the Company closed the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit of its 2007 federal income tax return. The resolution of the audit did not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations of the Company.

In 2011 the IRS commenced an audit of the
Company’s federal income tax returns for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. The IRS has proposed adjustments for both 2008 and
2009 and the Company expects to settle the audit in early 2013. Although the audit has not been fully resolved, the Company believes
that the ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results
of operations.

Earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries are generally
subject to U.S. taxation when repatriated. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings outside the U.S. except in instances
where repatriating such earnings would result in minimal additional tax. The Company currently has no plan to remit earnings which
will result in a material tax cost. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized additional tax expense that may result from the
remittance of such earnings. The accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries approximated $85.0 million as of December
31, 2012. An estimate of the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely invested is $17.0
million.

11 — DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

The Company enters into a limited number
of derivative contracts to offset the potentially negative economic effects of interest rate and foreign exchange movements. The
Company accounts for its outstanding derivative contracts in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, which requires all derivatives,
including derivatives designated as accounting hedges, to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.

The following tables provide information
regarding the Company’s outstanding derivatives contracts as of, and for, the years ended (in thousands, except for number

The swap is designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted interest payments on borrowings.
As a result, changes in the fair value of this swap are deferred and are recorded in OCI, net of tax effect (see Note 5 —
Debt for additional information).


(2)

The Company has foreign exchange transaction risk since it typically enters into transactions in
the normal course of business that are denominated in foreign currencies that differ from the local functional currency. The Company
enters into short-term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the economic effects of these foreign currency transaction
risks. These contracts are accounted for at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in Other income
(expense), net since the Company does not designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. All of the outstanding contracts
at December 31, 2012 matured by the end of February 2013.

(3)

See Note 12 — Fair Value Disclosures below for the determination of the fair value of these
instruments.

(4)

Changes in the fair value of these swaps were recognized in earnings. Both swaps matured in January
2012.

At December 31, 2012, the Company’s
derivative counterparties were all large investment grade financial institutions. The Company did not have any collateral arrangements
with its derivative counterparties, and none of the derivative contracts contained credit-risk related contingent features.

12 — FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

The Company’s financial instruments
include cash equivalents, fees receivable from customers, accounts payable, and accruals which are normally short-term in nature.
The Company believes the carrying amounts of these financial instruments reasonably approximates their fair value due to their
short-term nature. The Company’s financial instruments also includes borrowings outstanding under its 2010 Credit Agreement,
and at December 31, 2012, the Company had $200.0 million of floating rate debt outstanding under this arrangement, which is carried
at amortized cost. The Company believes the carrying amount of the outstanding borrowings reasonably approximates fair value since
the rate of interest on the borrowings reflect current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable maturities.

FASB ASC Topic 820 provides a framework
for the measurement of fair value and a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of assets
and liabilities. Classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the resulting
fair value measurement. The valuation hierarchy contains three levels. Level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such
as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable
inputs, such as internally-created valuation models. The Company does not currently utilize Level 3 valuation inputs to remeasure
any of its assets or liabilities. However, level 3 inputs may be used by the Company in its required annual impairment review of
goodwill. Information regarding the periodic assessment of the Company’s goodwill is included in Note 1 — Business
and Significant Accounting Policies.

On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted
ASU No. 2011-04,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements
in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,

which updates FASB ASC Topic 820 with new requirements. These include: (1) a prohibition on grouping
financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value, except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis
of the entity’s net exposure to the group; (2) an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all
fair value measurements (that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets);
and (3) a requirement that for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, entities disclose additional quantitative information
about unobservable inputs, a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements
and their potential impact on operating results. The Company has a limited number of assets and liabilities recorded in its Consolidated
Balance Sheets that are remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis, and the Company does not currently utilize Level 3 valuation
inputs to remeasure any of its assets or liabilities. In addition, the Company typically does not transfer assets or liabilities
between different levels of the fair value hierarchy. As a result, the adoption of ASU No. 2011-04 did not result in any changes
to the Company’s processes for determining fair values or require additional fair value disclosures.


The Company’s assets and liabilities that
are remeasured to fair value are presented in the following table (in thousands):

The Company has a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated officers,
managers and other key employees (see Note 13 — Employee Benefits). The plan’s assets consist of investments in money
market and mutual funds, and company-owned life insurance contracts.

The money market funds consist of cash equivalents
    while the mutual fund investments consist of publicly-traded and quoted equity shares. The Company considers the fair value
    of these assets to be based on Level 1 inputs, and these assets had a fair value of $8.2 million and $8.0 million as of
    December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The carrying amount of the life insurance contracts equals their cash surrender
    value, which approximates fair value. Cash surrender value represents the estimated amount that the Company would receive
    upon termination of the contract. The Company considers the life insurance contracts to be valued based on a Level 2 input,
    and these assets had a fair value of $19.6 million and $17.0 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The related
    deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at the amount needed to settle the liability, which approximates fair
    value, and is based on a Level 2 input.

(2)

The Company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge the effects of adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (see Note 11 — Derivatives and Hedging). Valuation of the foreign currency
forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets, which the Company considers a Level 2 input.

(3)

The Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the risk from interest rates on its
borrowings (see Note 11 — Derivatives and Hedging). To determine the fair value of these financial instruments, the Company
relies on mark-to-market valuations prepared by a third-party broker. Valuation is based on observable interest rates from recently
executed market transactions and other observable market data, which the Company considers Level 2 inputs. The Company independently
corroborates the reasonableness of the valuations prepared by the third-party broker through the use of an electronic quotation
service.

13 — EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Defined contribution plan.

The Company
has a savings and investment plan (the “401k Plan”) covering substantially all U.S. employees. Company contributions
are based upon the level of employee contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of the employee’s eligible salary, subject to an
annual maximum. For 2012, the maximum match was $6,800. In addition, the Company, in its discretion, may also contribute at least
1% of an employee’s base compensation, subject to an IRS annual limitation, which was $2,500 for 2012. Amounts expensed in
connection with the 401k Plan totaled $14.2 million, $15.9 million, and $14.6 million, in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Deferred compensation plan.

The Company
has a supplemental deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated officers, managers and other key employees,
which is structured as a rabbi trust. The plan’s investment assets are classified in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value. The value of these assets was $27.8 million and $25.1 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively
(see Note 12 — Fair Value Disclosures for fair value information). The corresponding deferred compensation liability of $31.3
million and $28.1 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is carried at fair value, and is adjusted with a corresponding
charge or credit to compensation cost to reflect the fair value of the amount owed to the employees which is classified in Other
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total compensation expense recognized for the plan was $0.4 million in 2012, $0.3
million in 2011, and zero in 2010.

Defined benefit pension plans.

The
Company has defined-benefit pension plans in several of its non-U.S. locations. Benefits earned under these plans are based on
years of service and level of employee compensation. The Company accounts for defined benefit plans in accordance with the requirements
of FASB ASC Topics 715 and 960.

The plan assets are held by third-party trustees and are invested in a diversified portfolio of equities, high quality government
and corporate bonds, and other investments. The assets are primarily valued based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs under the fair
value hierarchy in FASB ASC Topic 820, and the Company considers the overall portfolio of these assets to be of low-to-medium
investment risk. For the year-ended December 31, 2012, the Company contributed $6.4 million to these plans, and benefits paid
to participants was $0.7 million. While the actual return on plan assets for these plans was effectively zero in 2012, the Company
projects a future long-term rate of return on these plan assets of 3.6%, which it believes is reasonable based on the composition
of the assets and both current and projected market conditions.

In addition to the plan assets held with third-party trustees,
the Company also maintains a reinsurance asset arrangement with a large international insurance company. The reinsurance asset
is an asset of the Company whose purpose is to provide funding for benefit payments for one of the plans. At December 31, 2012,
the reinsurance asset was carried on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at its cash surrender value of $8.8 million
and is classified in Other Assets. The Company believes the cash


surrender value approximates
    fair value and is equivalent to a

Level 2 input under the FASB’s fair value framework in
    ASC Topic 820.

(2)

The Funded status — shortfall represents the amount of the projected benefit obligation that
the Company has not funded with a third-party trustee. This amount is a liability of the Company and is recorded in Other Liabilities
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(3)

The deferred actuarial loss as of December 31, 2012, is recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (“AOCI”) and will be reclassified out of AOCI and recognized as pension expense over approximately 14 years,
subject to certain limitations set forth in FASB ASC Topic 715. The impact of this amortization on the periodic pension expense
in 2013 will be immaterial. For 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately $0.2 million, $0.1 million, and $0.2 million, respectively,
of deferred actuarial pension gains were reclassified from AOCI to pension expense. The Company considers the impact of the reclassifications
for those years to be immaterial.

14 —
SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company manages its business through three
reportable segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research consists primarily of subscription-based research products, access
to research inquiry, peer networking services, and membership programs. Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement
engagements, and strategic advisory services. Events consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions.

The Company evaluates reportable segment performance
and allocates resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution, as presented in the table below, is defined as
operating income excluding certain COS and SG&A expenses, depreciation, acquisition and integration charges, and amortization
of intangibles. Certain bonus and fringe benefit costs included in consolidated COS are not allocated to segment expense. The accounting
policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the Company. There are no intersegment revenues.

The Company earns revenue from clients in many
countries. Other than the United States, there is no individual country in which revenues from external clients represent 10% or
more of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Additionally, no single client accounted for 10% or more of total revenue and
the loss of a single client, in management’s opinion, would not have a material adverse effect on revenues. The Company does
not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by reportable segment. Accordingly, assets are not being reported
by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions
in the allocation of resources.

The Company’s revenues are generated primarily
through direct sales to clients by domestic and international sales forces and a network of independent international sales agents.
Most of the Company’s products and services are provided on an integrated worldwide basis, and because of this integrated
delivery, it is not practical to precisely separate our revenues by geographic location.


Accordingly, the separation set forth
in the table below is based upon internal allocations, which involve certain management estimates and judgments. Revenues in the
table are reported based on where the sale is fulfilled; “Other International” revenues are those attributable to all
areas located outside of the United States and Canada, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa.
