PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

GENERAL

Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT) is the world’s leading information technology research and advisory
company. Gartner delivers the technology-related insight necessary for its clients to make the
right decisions, every day. From CIOs and senior IT leaders in corporations and government
agencies, to business leaders in high-tech and telecom enterprises and professional services firms,
to technology investors, Gartner is the indispensable partner to 60,000 clients in 10,000 distinct
organizations. Through the resources of Gartner Research, Gartner Consulting and Gartner Events,
Gartner works with every client to research, analyze and interpret the business of IT within the
context of their individual role. Founded in 1979, Gartner is headquartered in Stamford,
Connecticut, U.S.A. We have 4,100 associates, including over 1,100 research analysts and
consultants, and we have clients in over 80 countries. For more information, visit

www.gartner.com

. References to “the
Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” are to Gartner, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

The foundation for all Gartner products and services is our independent research on IT issues. The
findings from this research are delivered through our three customer segments — Research,
Consulting and Events:

•

Research

provides insight for CIOs, IT professionals, technology companies and the investment
community through reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well as peer networking
services and membership programs designed specifically for CIOs and other senior executives.

•

Consulting

consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory
services (paid one-day analyst engagements) (“SAS”), which provide assessments of cost,
performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT industry.

•

Events

consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry.

Since its founding in 1979, Gartner has established a leading brand in the IT research marketplace.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Information technology has become increasingly critical to the operational and financial success of
corporations and governments over the last two decades. Once a support function, IT is now viewed
as a strategic component of growth and operating performance. Accordingly, it has become imperative
for executives and IT professionals to manage their IT spending and purchasing decisions
efficiently and effectively.

As the cost of IT solutions continues to rise, executives and technology professionals have
realized the importance of making well-informed decisions and increasingly seek to maximize their
returns on IT capital investments. As a result, any IT investment decision in an enterprise is
subject to increased financial scrutiny, especially in the current challenging economic climate. In
addition, today’s IT marketplace is dynamic and complex. Technology providers continually introduce
new products with a wide variety of standards and features that are prone to shorter life cycles.
Users of technology — a group that encompasses nearly all organizations — must keep abreast of
new developments in technology to ensure that their IT systems are reliable, efficient and meet
both their current and future needs.

Given the heightened emphasis organizations are placing on technology decision making and spending,
companies and governments are increasingly turning to outside experts for guidance in IT
procurement, implementation and operations in order to maximize the value of their IT investments.
Accordingly, it is critical that CIOs and other executives obtain value-added, independent and
objective research and analysis of the IT market to assist them in these IT-related decisions.

OUR SOLUTION

We provide high-quality, independent and objective research and analysis of the IT industry.
Through our entire product portfolio, our global research team provides thought leadership and
insight about technology acquisition and deployment to CIOs, executives and other technology
leaders.



We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our
intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute
our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports and briefings,
consulting and advisory services, and hosting symposia, conferences and exhibitions.

With a
base of 650 research analysts, we create timely and relevant technology-related research. In
addition, we have 470 experienced consultants who combine our objective, independent research with
a practical, business perspective focused on the IT industry. Our events are among the world’s
largest of their kind, gathering highly qualified audiences of senior business executives, IT
professionals and purchasers and providers of IT products and services.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate
increased client spending on our research, consulting and events. A critical part of our long-term
strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships
with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically
relevant research and analysis. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client
relationships, and augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. In
addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of
our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more
effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services.

Our principal products and services are delivered via our Research, Consulting and Events segments:



Gartner Invest provides premium research focused on the needs of institutional investors who
invest in technology companies.

•

CONSULTING.

Gartner consultants provide fact-based consulting services to help our clients
use and manage IT to enable business performance. We seek to accomplish three major outcomes
for our clients: applying IT to drive improvements in business performance; creating
sustainable IT efficiency that ensures a constant return on IT investments; and strengthening
the IT organization and operations to ensure high-value services to the client’s lines of
business and to enable the client to adapt to business changes.

We utilize our benchmarking capabilities and our business solutions to drive these outcomes.
Our benchmarking capabilities are provided as information offerings. Our business solutions,
enabled by benchmarking, include IT Transformation, IT Optimization, Sourcing Optimization and
Business Enablement. We deliver our consulting solutions by capitalizing on Gartner assets that
are invaluable to IT decision making, including: (1) our research, which ensures that our
consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the
business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our client’s
success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons
and best practices to assess and improve performance.

•

EVENTS.

Gartner symposia and conferences are gatherings of technology’s most senior IT
professionals, business strategists, and practitioners. Symposia and conferences give clients
live access to insights developed from our latest proprietary research in a concentrated way.
Informative sessions led by Gartner analysts are augmented with technology showcases, peer
exchange, analyst one-on-one meetings, workshops and keynotes by technology’s top leaders.
Symposia and conferences, which are not limited to Gartner research clients, also provide
participants with an opportunity to interact with business executives from the world’s leading
technology companies. In 2008, the 70 Gartner events we held throughout the United States,
Europe, Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region attracted over 41,000 attendees.

Gartner conferences attract high-level IT and business professionals who seek in-depth knowledge
about technology products and services. Gartner Symposia are large, strategic conferences held in
various locations throughout the world for senior IT and business professionals. Symposia are
combined with ITxpo, an exhibition where the latest technology products and solutions are
demonstrated. We also offer conferences in many locations around the world on specialized topics
such as security, outsourcing, wireless technology, and the impact of IT on the public sector and
the utilities, media and financial services industries.

See Note 14 — Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained
within this Form 10-K for financial information about our geographic areas and our three business
segments: Research, Consulting and Events.

COMPETITION

We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are:

Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of
independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly against
consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print



media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future.
Additionally, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our
clients through the Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do
business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide
additional or complementary services. However, we believe the breadth and depth of our research
assets position us well versus our competition. Increased competition may result in loss of market
share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased sales and
marketing expenditures.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge
capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark,
trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our
intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership and the use
and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property, and we also enter into agreements with our
employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property.

We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify,
create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end
users.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2008, we had 4,198 employees, of which 719 were located at our headquarters in
Stamford, Connecticut; 1,747 were located elsewhere in the United
States; and 1,732 were located outside of the United States. Our employees may be subject to collective bargaining
agreements at a company or industry level in those foreign countries where this is part of the
local labor law or practice. We have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with
our employees to be favorable.

On January 8, 2009, we announced a reduction in force of 117 employees. The affected positions
were spread across various functions and geographies.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Factors That May Affect Future Performance.

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we and our clients are affected
by global economic conditions. The following section discusses many, but not all, of these risks
and uncertainties, but is not intended to be all-inclusive.

Risks related to our business

Our operating results could be negatively impacted by the current global credit crisis and the
economic downturn.

Our business is impacted by general economic conditions, both domestic and abroad. The current
global credit crisis and economic downturn may negatively and materially affect demand for our
products and services. This downturn could materially and adversely affect our business, including
the ability to maintain client retention, wallet retention and consulting utilization rates,
achieve contract value and consulting backlog growth, and attract attendees and exhibitors to our
events. Such developments could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations,
and cash flows.

We face significant competition and our failure to compete successfully could materially adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We face direct competition from a significant number of independent providers of information
products and services, including information available on the Internet free of charge. We also
compete indirectly against consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic
and print media companies, some of which may have greater financial, information gathering and
marketing resources than we do. These indirect competitors could also choose to compete directly
with us in the future. In addition, limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do
business. As a result, additional new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to
provide additional or complementary services. Additionally, technological advances may provide
increased competition from a variety of sources.

While we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our
competition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against current
and future competitors and our failure to do so could result in loss of market share, diminished
value in our products and services, reduced pricing and increased marketing expenditures.
Furthermore, we may not be successful if we cannot compete effectively on quality of research and
analysis, timely delivery of information, customer service, and the ability to offer products to
meet changing market needs for information and analysis, or price.

We may not be able to maintain our existing products and services.

We operate in a rapidly evolving market, and our success depends upon our ability to deliver high
quality and timely research and analysis to our clients. Any failure to continue to provide
credible and reliable information that is useful to our clients could have a material adverse
effect on future business and operating results. Further, if our predictions prove to be wrong or
are not substantiated by appropriate research, our reputation may suffer and demand for our
products and services may decline. In addition, we must continue to improve our methods for
delivering our products and services in a cost-effective manner. Failure to increase and improve
our electronic delivery capabilities could adversely affect our future business and operating
results.

We may not be able to enhance and develop our existing products and services, or introduce the new
products and services, that are needed to remain competitive.

The market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing needs for information
and analysis on the IT industry as a whole. The development of new products is a complex and
time-consuming process. Nonetheless, to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to
enhance and improve our products and services, develop or acquire new products and services,
deliver all products and services in a timely manner, and appropriately position and price new
products and services relative to the marketplace and our costs of producing them. Any failure to
achieve successful client acceptance of new products and services could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Additionally, significant
delays in new product or services releases or significant problems in creating new products or
services could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.



We depend on renewals of subscription-based services and sales of new subscription-based services
for a significant portion of our revenue, and our failure to renew at historical rates or generate
new sales of such services could lead to a decrease in our revenues.

A large portion of our success depends on our ability to generate renewals of our
subscription-based research products and services and new sales of such products and services, both
to new clients and existing clients. These products and services
constituted 60% and 58% of our
revenues for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Generating new sales of our subscription-based products
and services, both to new and existing clients, is often a time consuming process. If we are unable
to generate new sales, due to competition or other factors, our revenues will be adversely
affected.

Our research subscription agreements have terms that generally range from twelve to thirty months.
Our ability to maintain contract renewals is subject to numerous factors, including the following:

•

delivering high-quality and timely analysis and advice to our clients;

•

understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of our clients; and

•

delivering products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand
competition.

Additionally, as we implement our strategy to realign our business to client needs, we may shift
the type and pricing of our products which may impact client renewal rates. While research client
retention rates were 82% at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, there can be no guarantee that we will
continue to maintain this rate of client renewals.

We depend on non-recurring consulting engagements and our failure to secure new engagements could
lead to a decrease in our revenues.

Consulting
segment revenues constituted 27% of our total revenues for 2008 and
28% for 2007. These
consulting engagements typically are project-based and non-recurring. Our ability to replace
consulting engagements is subject to numerous factors, including the following:

•

delivering consistent, high-quality consulting services to our clients;

•

tailoring our consulting services to the changing needs of our clients; and

•

our ability to match the skills and competencies of our consulting staff to the skills
required for the fulfillment of existing or potential consulting engagements.

Any material decline in our ability to replace consulting arrangements could have an adverse impact
on our revenues and our financial condition.

The profitability and success of our conferences, symposia and events could be adversely affected
by external factors beyond our control.

The market for desirable dates and locations for conferences, symposia and events is highly
competitive. If we cannot secure desirable dates and locations for our conferences, symposia and
events their profitability could suffer, and our financial condition and results of operations may
be adversely affected. In addition, because our events are scheduled in advance and held at
specific locations, the success of these events can be affected by circumstances outside of our
control, such as labor strikes, transportation shutdowns and travel restrictions, economic
slowdowns, terrorist attacks, weather, natural disasters and other world events impacting the
global economy, the occurrence of any of which could negatively impact the success of the event.

Our sales to governments are subject to appropriations and may be terminated.

We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and their
respective agencies, as well as foreign governments and their agencies. At December 31, 2008 and
2007, $192.0 million and $190.0 million, respectively, of our Research contract value and
Consulting backlog was attributable to governments. Our U.S. government contracts are subject to
the approval of appropriations by the U.S. Congress to fund the agencies contracting for our
services, and our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to various government
authorizations and funding mechanisms. In general, most if not all of these contracts



may be terminated at any time without cause (‘termination for convenience”). Should appropriations
for the governments and agencies that contract with us be curtailed, or should government contracts
be terminated for convenience, we may experience a significant loss of revenue.

We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel which could jeopardize the quality of
our products and services.

Our success depends heavily upon the quality of our senior management, research analysts,
consultants, sales and other key personnel. We face competition for the limited pool of these
qualified professionals from, among others, technology companies, market research firms, consulting
firms, financial services companies and electronic and print media companies, some of which have a
greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals. Some of the personnel that we
attempt to hire are subject to non-compete agreements that could impede our short-term recruitment
efforts. Any failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as
required to support the evolving needs of clients or growth in our business, could adversely affect
the quality of our products and services, as well as future business and operating results.

We may not be able to maintain the equity in our brand name.

We believe that our “Gartner” brand, including our independence, is critical to our efforts to
attract and retain clients and that the importance of brand recognition will increase as
competition increases. We may expand our marketing activities to promote and strengthen the Gartner
brand and may need to increase our marketing budget, hire additional marketing and public relations
personnel, expend additional sums to protect the brand and otherwise increase expenditures to
create and maintain client brand loyalty. If we fail to effectively promote and maintain the
Gartner brand, or incur excessive expenses in doing so, our future business and operating results
could be adversely impacted.

Our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively
impact our future revenue and growth.

We have
clients in over 80 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international
sales. Our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international business
activities, including general political and economic conditions in each country, changes in market
demand as a result of tariffs and other trade barriers, challenges in staffing and managing foreign
operations, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with numerous foreign laws and
regulations, differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates and laws, and the difficulty of
enforcing client agreements, collecting accounts receivable and protecting intellectual property
rights in international jurisdictions. Furthermore, we rely on local distributors or sales agents
in some international locations. If any of these arrangements are terminated by our agent or us, we
may not be able to replace the arrangement on beneficial terms or on a timely basis, or clients of
the local distributor or sales agent may not want to continue to do business with us or our new
agent.

Our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Approximately 47% and 45% of our revenues for 2008 and 2007, respectively, were derived from sales
outside of the U.S. Revenues earned outside the U.S. are typically transacted in local currencies,
which may fluctuate significantly against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts
to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our revenues and results of
operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.

Catastrophic events or geo-political conditions may disrupt our business.

A disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major weather event,
cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales,
providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. Our corporate headquarters is
located approximately 30 miles from New York City, and we have an operations center located in Ft.
Myers, Florida, in a hurricane-prone area. We also operate in numerous international locations. A
catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or
information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and
negatively impact our operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed
conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our
operating costs. Additionally, these conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget
decisions of our clients.



We may experience outages and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate
operations infrastructure.

Our increasing user traffic and complexity of our products and services demand more computing
power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to maintain data centers
and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic
on our websites. However, any inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of
our products, services, and user experience, resulting in damage to our reputation and loss of
current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, harming our operating results and
financial condition.

Our outstanding debt obligations could impact our financial condition or future operating results.

At December 31, 2008, we had $416.3 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which provides
for two amortizing term loans with quarterly payments and a $300.0 million revolving credit
facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our
lenders’ discretion (the “expansion feature”), for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0
million. However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending
upon prevailing credit market conditions.

The affirmative, negative and financial covenants of the Credit Agreement could limit our future
financial flexibility. Additionally, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in
acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, which would materially impact
our financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with our lenders. No assurance
can be given that we would be successful in doing so in this current
financial climate, or that any accommodations that we were able to
negotiate would be on terms as favorable as those presently contained
in the Credit Agreement.

The associated debt service costs of the borrowing arrangement under our Credit Agreement could
impair our future operating results. The outstanding debt may limit the amount of cash or
additional credit available to us, which could restrain our ability to expand or enhance products
and services, respond to competitive pressures or pursue future business opportunities requiring
substantial investments of additional capital.

We may require additional cash resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.

We believe that our existing cash balances, projected cash flow from operations, and the remaining
borrowing capacity we have under our five-year revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our
expected short-term and foreseeable long-term operating needs.

We may, however, require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions,
implementation of our strategy and stock repurchase program, to repay indebtedness or to pursue
future business opportunities requiring substantial investments of additional capital. If our
existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements, we may seek additional
borrowings. Prevailing credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost,
and, as a result, financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at
all. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service
obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further
restrict our operations.

If we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position
may be harmed.

We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and
other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to
protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology
or other information that we regard as proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not
survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us. The laws of
certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the
United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against
unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Our
employees are subject to non-compete agreements. When the non-competition period expires, former
employees may compete against us. If a former employee chooses to compete against us prior to the
expiration of the non-competition period, we seek to enforce these non-compete provisions but there
is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts.

We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions and strategic investments, which
could involve substantial risks.

We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses
that offer complementary products and services. The risks involved in each acquisition or
investment include the possibility of paying more than the value we derive from the acquisition,
dilution of the interests of our current stockholders or decreased working capital, increased
indebtedness, the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and unknown and unforeseen risks, the
ability to retain key personnel of the acquired company, the time to train the sales force to
market and sell the products of the acquired business, the potential disruption of our ongoing
business and the distraction of management from our business. The realization of any of these risks
could adversely affect our business.



We face risks related to litigation.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to a variety of legal actions, such as employment, breach
of contract, intellectual property-related, and business torts, including claims of unfair trade
practices and misappropriation of trade secrets. Given the nature of our business, we are also
subject to defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the
information we publish. Regardless of the merits, responding to any such claim could be time
consuming, result in costly litigation and require us to enter into settlements, royalty and
licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on reasonable terms. If a successful
claim is made against us and we fail to settle the claim on reasonable terms, our business, results
of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected.

We face risks related to taxation.

We operate in numerous domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations and
profitability in each jurisdiction may have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we
recognize in any given year. In addition, our tax filings for various tax years are subject to
audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business, and in the ordinary course
of business, we may be under audit by one or more tax authorities from time to time. Recently, we
have been notified by the Internal Revenue Service that it intends to audit our 2007 tax return,
and this audit is expected to commence shortly.

These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes, and resolution of these matters
involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the
amounts we have recorded. Additionally, the results of an audit could have a material effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that
determination is made.

Risks related to our common stock

Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and may not meet the expectations of
securities analysts or investors or guidance we have given, which may cause the price of our common
stock to decline.

Our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors,
including the timing of the execution of research contracts, the extent of completion of consulting
engagements, the timing of symposia and other events, the amount of new business generated, the mix
of domestic and international business, currency fluctuations, changes in market demand for our
products and services, the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products
and services, and competition in the industry. An inability to generate sufficient earnings and
cash flow, and achieve our forecasts, may impact our operating and other activities. The potential
fluctuations in our operating results could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results
not to be meaningful and may provide an unreliable indication of future operating results.
Furthermore, our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or
investors in the future or guidance we have given. If this occurs, the price of our stock would
likely decline.

Our stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or
above the price you paid.

The trading prices of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to,
among other factors, variations in operating results, developments in the industries in which we do
business, general economic conditions, general market conditions, changes in the nature and
composition of our stockholder base, changes in securities analysts’ recommendations regarding our
securities and our performance relative to securities analysts’ expectations for any quarterly
period. Such volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by our current
stockholders, or the threat that substantial sales may occur, could cause the market price of our
common stock to decrease significantly or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital by
selling stock. Furthermore, we have various equity incentive plans that provide for awards in the
form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and
other stock-based awards. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate number of shares of our common
stock issuable pursuant to outstanding grants and awards under these plans was approximately 11.1
million shares (approximately 6.7 million of which have vested). In addition, approximately 5.8
million shares may be issued in connection with future awards under our equity incentive plans.
Shares of common stock issued under these plans are freely transferable without further
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), except for any
shares held by affiliates (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act). We cannot
predict the size of future issuances of



our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common
stock will have on the market price of our common stock.

Interests of certain of our significant stockholders may conflict with yours.

ValueAct Capital and affiliates (“ValueAct”) owned approximately 22.1% of our common stock as of
December 31, 2008, while Silver Lake Partners and affiliates (“Silver Lake”) owned approximately
12.8% on the same date. To our knowledge, three other institutional investors each presently hold over 5%
of our common stock. Additionally, representatives of Silver Lake and ValueAct in the aggregate
presently hold three seats on our Board of Directors.

While no stockholder or institutional investor individually holds a majority of our outstanding
shares, these significant stockholders may be able, either individually or acting together, to
exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election
of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, adoption or amendment of equity plans
and approval of significant transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and sales or
purchases of assets. In addition, in the event of a proposed acquisition of the company by a third
party, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change of control in the Company.
Accordingly, the interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the
interests of other stockholders, or otherwise be in the best interests of the Company or all
stockholders.

Our anti-takeover protections may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if a change in
control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it
difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of
Directors. These provisions include:

•

the ability of our Board of Directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock;

•

advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings;

•

a preferred shares rights agreement; and

•

the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law.

These provisions could discourage or prevent a change of control or change in management that might
provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

There are no unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC staff 180 days or more
before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the Exchange
Act.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Our corporate headquarters is located in approximately 213,000 square feet of leased office space
in three buildings located in Stamford, Connecticut, USA. Our Stamford facility accommodates
research and analysis, marketing, sales, client support, production, and corporate services and
administration. The lease on this facility expires in late 2010, and does provide for a renewal
option.

We also have a significant presence in the United Kingdom with approximately 72,000 square feet of
leased office space in two buildings located in Egham, UK, for which the leases expire in 2020 and
2025, respectively.

We lease an additional 19 domestic and 43 international locations that support our research and
analysis, domestic and international sales efforts, and other functions. We continue to constantly
assess our space needs as our business changes, but we believe that our existing facilities are
adequate for our current needs and that additional space will be available as needed.



ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued from all
proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations when resolved in a future period.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

We did not submit any matter to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of the year
covered by this Annual Report.

Our 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on June 4, 2009 at the Company’s offices in
Stamford, Connecticut.

DIVIDEND POLICY

We currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock. Our Credit Agreement, dated as of
January 31, 2007, contains a negative covenant which may limit our ability to pay dividends. In
addition, our Amended and Restated Security Holders Agreement with Silver Lake requires us to
obtain Silver Lake’s consent prior to declaring or paying dividends.

The equity compensation plan information set forth in Part III, Item 12 of this Form 10-K is hereby
incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 5.

SHARE REPURCHASES

The following table provides detail related to repurchases of our common stock in the fourth
quarter of 2008. All shares repurchased were added to treasury stock. All repurchases were made
pursuant to a publicly announced $250.0 million share repurchase program that was authorized by the
Board of Directors in February 2008. The open market purchases were made by brokers pursuant to
purchase programs that complied with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

The purpose of the following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is to help facilitate
the understanding of significant factors influencing the operating results, financial condition and
cash flows of Gartner, Inc. Additionally, the MD&A also conveys our expectations of the potential
impact of known trends, events or uncertainties that may impact future results. You should read
this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes
included in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily
indicative of operating results for future periods.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

In addition to historical information, this Annual Report contains forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact, including
statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the
future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as
“may,” “will,” “expect,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” ‘plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “predict,”
“potential,” “continue,” or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are subject
to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a
difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect
management’s opinion only as of the date on which they were made. Except as required by law, we
disclaim any obligation to review or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances as they occur. Readers should review carefully any risk factors described in our
reports filed with the SEC.

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our
business segments:

BUSINESS SEGMENT

BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS

Research

Contract value

represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related
research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated
as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific
point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract.

Client retention rate

represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business
relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage
basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients
from a year ago.

Wallet retention rate

represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have
retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a
percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year
earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds
client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or
increased spending by retained clients, or both.

Number of executive program members

represents the number of paid participants in
executive programs.

Consulting

Consulting backlog

represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting,
measurement and strategic advisory services engagements.

Utilization rates

represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization
rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours
billed by total hours available to bill.

Billing Rate

represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours.

Average annualized revenue per billable headcount

represents a measure of the revenue
generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by
multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the
billable hours available for one year.

Events

Number of events

represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period.

Number of attendees

represents the number of people who attend events.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

The cornerstones of our strategy are to focus on producing extraordinary research content, deliver
innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, enhance our sales capability, provide world
class client service, and improve our operational effectiveness.

We had total revenues of $1,279.1 million in 2008, up 9% over the prior year. Total revenues
increased in all of our geographic regions. We had income from continuing operations of $97.1
million in 2008, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $70.7
million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for 2007. These improved results are due to a number of
factors, including higher overall revenues in Research and Consulting, a continued focus on expense
management, the impact of a legal settlement and other charges in 2007, the favorable impact of
foreign currency, and a lower share base due to share repurchases. These positive trends offset
lower revenue and profitability in our Events segment.

In our Research business, we had strong, double-digit revenue growth in 2008, with revenues up 15%
over the prior year, to $773.2 million. Revenue growth occurred across our entire product
portfolio, with all client sizes, industry segments, and products delivering growth. Research
contract value was $834.3 million at December 31, 2008, up 11% from December 31, 2007, and a record
level for us. Our contract value growth was broad-based across all of our industry sectors.
Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues and contract value were up
14% and 8% year-over-year, respectively.



Our client retention and wallet retention rates for 2008 remained strong at 82% and 98%,
respectively, compared to 82% and 101% in the prior year. Our Executive Program membership was
3,733 at December 31, 2008, compared to 3,753 members at December 31, 2007.

Consulting revenue in 2008 was up 7% over 2007, to $347.4 million, reflecting growth in our core
consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract
optimization business. Our consultant utilization rate increased 3 points, to 72% from 69% in the
prior year, reflecting improved engagement management. Billable headcount was 499 at December 31,
2008, up from 472 at December 31, 2007. The hourly billing rate remained above $350 per hour in
2008, while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was approximately $458,000 for
2008, about 7% higher than the prior year. Consulting backlog at December 31, 2008 was $97.2
million, down from $121.4 million at December 31, 2007.

Events revenues decreased 6%, or $10.0 million, to $150.1 million in 2008 compared to $160.1
million in 2007. We held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 in 2007. The revenue decrease was due to
declines in both the number of attendees and exhibitors, as travel restrictions and other expense
controls negatively impacted our fourth quarter Events segment results. For 2009, we are currently
planning to hold 54 events.

For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see Segment Results below.

We repurchased 9.7 million of our common shares in 2008. We had $184.4 million of operating cash
flow in 2008, significantly higher than the prior year, and we ended the year with $140.9 million
in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2008, we also had $178.3 million of available
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We believe we have a strong cash position
and adequate borrowing capacity.

FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS

Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many
factors, including: the timing of our SymposiumITxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth
calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and
international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign
currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and
services; competition in the industry; and other factors. The potential fluctuations in our
operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful
and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting
policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an
understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective
judgments and the use of estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are
described below.

Revenue recognition

— We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (“SAB 101”), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
104, Revenue Recognition (“SAB 104”). Once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been
met, revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows:

•

Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products. Revenues
from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term;

•

Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material
engagements. Revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion
basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and/or
services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in
nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment.

•

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium,
conference or exhibition;

•

Other revenues consist primarily of fees from research reprints which are recognized when
the reprint is shipped.

The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a
limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable,
except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which have
not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the
contract that



is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as
deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim.

For those government contracts that permit termination, we bill the client the full amount billable
under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In
addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received.
Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $61.6 million and $57.6 million at
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007, we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to
government contracts that permit termination, of $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively.

Uncollectible fees receivable

— The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and
allowance reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction to revenues or an
increase to expense. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for
uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding
receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific
clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation
reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate
collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation
reserves to increase include changes in our clients’ liquidity and credit quality, other factors
negatively impacting our clients’ ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the
effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable,
along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands):

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets

— The evaluation of goodwill is performed in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, — “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill
amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The
evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require
management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business
operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine
that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an
impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our
financial statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we
consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following:

Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the
valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these
valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to
uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates.

Accounting for income taxes

— As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our
income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our
current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing
treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets
and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the
availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and
ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation
allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the
future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment is



made to reduce the valuation allowance and increase income in the period such determination is
made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred
tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance is charged against income in the
period such determination is made.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes” (“FIN 48”) (see Note 11 — Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and
recognition in accounting for income taxes. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, and accounting in interim periods and requires expanded
disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes.

Accounting for stock-based compensation

— On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), as interpreted by SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”). Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company is recognizing stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the
award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note
9 — Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation
awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the
expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company’s common stock price volatility. In
addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to
estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance
targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the
associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the
Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different
assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company’s stock-based compensation awards
changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense
could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.

Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals

— We record accruals for severance costs, lease
costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of
actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce
ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease
payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based
on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those
estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due to
changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved.
Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year.
Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require
adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after
year end.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In February 2008 the Company sold its Vision Events business, which had been part of its Events
segment, and has reported the results of operations of this business as a discontinued operation
(see Note 2 — Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As a
result, the results discussed below and in the “Segment Results” section for the years ended prior
to December 31, 2008 have been restated to present the results of operations of the Vision Events
business as a discontinued operation in order to be consistent with the current year presentation.

2008 VERSUS 2007

TOTAL REVENUES increased by $110.6 million, or 9%, to $1,279.1 million in 2008 from
$1,168.5 million during 2007. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation,
total revenues for 2008 would have increased 8% over 2007.

Total revenues increased in all of our geographic regions. Revenues from sales to United States and
Canadian clients increased 9%, to $723.2 million in 2008 from $661.2 million in 2007. Revenues from
sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) increased to $430.4 million in 2008
from $403.9 million in 2007, a 7% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in our Other
International region increased 21%, to $125.4 million in 2008 from $103.3 million in 2007.

An overview of our results by segment follows:

•

Research

revenues increased 15% in 2008 to $773.3 million, compared to $673.3 million in
2007, and comprised approximately 60% and 58% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.



•

Consulting

revenues increased 7% in 2008 to $347.4 million, compared to $325.0 million in
2007, and comprised approximately 27% and 28% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $150.1 million in 2008, a decrease of 6% from $160.1 million in 2007,
and comprised approximately 12% and 14% of our total revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

•

Other

revenues, consisting principally of research reprint revenues, declined to $8.3 million
in 2008 from $10.0 million in 2007.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled “Segment Results” for a further discussion of
results by segment.

COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased $24.0 million, or about 5%, when
comparing 2008 with 2007, to $554.8 million from $530.8 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact
of foreign exchange, Cost of service and product development would have increased by about 4%.

The year-over-year increase of $24.0 million was due to several factors. We had $17.0 million of
higher salary, commissions, and other benefit costs, $5.7 million in additional severance and
benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in force, and $4.0 million in additional
Events fulfillment costs. The impact of foreign currency translation added about $2.1 million of
expense. Partially offsetting these higher charges was a decrease of approximately $3.0 million in
lower headcount costs, primarily due to our exit from consulting operations in Asia-Pacific in
mid-2007, as well as lower stock-compensation charges of about $1.2 million.

As a percentage of sales, Cost of services and product development was 43% and 45% in 2008 and 2007
respectively, a decrease of 2 points, which is due to a number of factors. These factors include
higher revenues coupled with the inherent operating leverage in our Research business, improved
productivity in core Consulting, substantially increased revenues in our higher margin contract
optimization business in our Consulting segment, and a continued focus on expense management.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”) expense increased 13%, or $59.6 million, to
$532.4 million in 2008 compared to $472.7 million in 2007. The year-over-year impact of foreign
currency translation was flat.

The $59.6 million increase in SG&A expense resulted primarily from increased investment in our
sales organization, severance and benefits charges related to our fourth quarter reduction in
force, and increases in other payroll and benefits costs. Growth in our sales organization resulted
in approximately $38.0 million of additional payroll and benefits, commissions, and travel expense
in 2008 when compared to 2007. We now have 928 quota-bearing sales associates, a 15% increase over
December 31, 2007. We had $2.8 million in severance and benefits charges related to our fourth
quarter reduction in force, while higher payroll and related benefits costs for our other staff
added about $13.0 million in costs. The remaining increase was spread across a number of other
cost categories, which was offset to some extent by lower recruiting and stock-compensation
charges.

DEPRECIATION expense increased 7% in 2008, to $25.9 million compared to $24.3 million for
the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of investment in capital
expenditures.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $1.6 million in 2008 compared to $2.1 million in 2007. The
decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2007.

OTHER CHARGES was zero in 2008 and $9.1 million in 2007. The $9.1 million included charges
of $8.7 million related to the settlement of litigation and $2.7 million of severance costs related
to the Company’s exit from consulting operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of
$2.3 million related to an excess facility which the Company returned to service.

OPERATING INCOME was $164.4 million and $129.5 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, an
increase of $34.9 million, or 27%. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2008 and
11% in 2007, which is due to a number of factors, the most significant being the impact from higher
revenues in our Research and Consulting businesses. Please refer to the section of this MD&A
entitled “Segment Results” below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment. The
improved operating performance also reflects our continued focus on expense management, charges of
$9.1 million in 2007 related to the settlement of litigation and other items, and a positive impact
from foreign currency translation.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $19.3 million and $22.2 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively,
a decrease of $2.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in the weighted-average
interest rate on our outstanding debt. The weighted-average interest rate on our debt, including
the impact of our interest rate swaps, was 4.8% in 2008 and 6.0% in 2007. The impact of the lower
average rate was



partially offset by an increase in the weighted-average amount of debt outstanding of approximately
$50.0 million during 2008. In 2008 we also had about $0.2 million of additional interest income, as
well as a $0.2 million decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs, both of which are
recorded in Interest Expense, net.

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $(0.4) million in 2008 and $3.2 million in 2007. The
$(0.4) million Other expense in 2008 primarily consisted of a $1.2 million gain related to the
settlement of a litigation matter and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. The $3.2
million of Other income in 2007 primarily consisted of a $1.8 million gain from the settlement of a
claim and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES on continuing operations was $47.6 million in 2008 as compared
to $39.8 million 2007. The effective tax rate was 32.9% in 2008 and 36.0% in 2007. The lower
effective tax rate in 2008 as compared to 2007 was attributable to several items. The most
significant of these items included the following: (a) the Company generated a larger percentage of
its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2008 as compared to 2007, and (b) differences relating to
the tax impact of repatriated funds in 2008 as compared to 2007.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, which includes the results of the
Company’s Vision Events business, was $6.7 million and $2.9 million for 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The Company sold the Vision Events business, which had been part of the Company’s
Events segment, in early 2008. The results for 2008 include a net gain on the sale of approximately
$7.1 million and a loss from operations of $(0.4) million.

NET INCOME was $103.9 million and $73.6 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an
increase of $30.3 million, or 41%.

Basic earnings per share was $1.09 per share in 2008 and $0.71 per share in 2007, while diluted was
$1.05 per share in 2008 and $0.68 per share in 2007. Both basic and diluted earnings for 2008
include $0.07 per share from discontinued operations, while basic and diluted earnings for 2007
include $0.03 per share from discontinued operations.

2007 VERSUS 2006

TOTAL REVENUES increased $131.2 million, or 13%, to $1,168.5 million in 2007 from $1,037.3
million during 2006. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation, total
revenues for 2007 would have increased 9% over 2006.

•

Research

revenues increased 18% in 2007 to $673.3 million, compared to $571.2 million in
2006, and comprised approximately 58% and 55% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

•

Consulting

revenues in 2007 of $325.0 million were up 6% compared to $305.2 million in 2006,
and comprised approximately 28% and 29% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

•

Events

revenues were $160.1 million in 2007, an increase of 9% from $146.4 million in 2006,
and comprised approximately 14% of total revenues in both 2007 and 2006.

•

Other

revenues, consisting principally of research reprint revenues, declined to $10.0
million in 2007 from $14.4 million in 2006.

Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled “Segment Results” for a further discussion of
revenues by segment.

Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients
increased 9%, to $661.2 million in 2007 from $608.3 million in 2006. Revenues from sales to clients
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) increased to $403.9 million in 2007 from $337.7
million in 2006, a 20% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in the Other International region
increased 13%, to $103.3 million in 2007 from $91.3 million in 2006.

COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased $40.2 million, or 8%, when comparing
2007 with 2006, to $530.1 million from $490.6 million, respectively. Excluding the unfavorable
effects of foreign currency translation, Cost of services and product development would have
increased about 4%. The $40.2 million increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency,
which added about $17.0 million of additional expense, $18.2 million of merit salary, bonus, and
fringe increases, $6.4 million of higher event fulfillment costs driven by higher events revenue,
and additional stock-based compensation costs under SFAS No. 123(R) of about $2.5 million. These
increases were offset to some extent by lower non-sales headcount and other charges. For the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Cost of services and product development as a percentage of
revenue was 45% and 47%, respectively.



SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (“SG&A”) expense increased $59.7 million, or
14% to $472.7 million from $413.1 million when comparing 2007 to 2006. Excluding the unfavorable
effects of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense would have increased by 12% year-over-year.
The $59.7 million increase in SG&A year-over-year resulted primarily from increased investment in
our sales organization, with expenses up approximately $30.0 million, foreign currency translation,
which added about $9.1 million of expense, and additional stock-based compensation under SFAS No.
123(R) of $5.4 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had 806 sales associates, a 22% increase over
the prior year-end. While SG&A expense increased 14% year-over-year, when sales-related expenses
are excluded General and Administrative (G&A) expense was down about one percentage point
year-over-year as a percentage of revenue.

DEPRECIATION expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $24.3 million compared to
$23.4 million in 2006, driven by higher capital expenditures. We had $24.2 million and $21.1
million of capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $2.1 million in 2007 compared to $10.7 million in 2006.
The decrease was due to certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2006.

META INTEGRATION CHARGES was zero in 2007 and $1.5 million in 2006. These expenses were primarily
for severance, and for consulting, accounting, and tax services.

OTHER CHARGES was $9.1 million and zero in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $9.1 million
included charges of $8.7 million related to the settlement of litigation and $2.7 million of severance costs related to the Company’s exit from consulting operations in Asia.
Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility which the
Company returned to service.

OPERATING INCOME was $129.5 million and $98.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an
increase of $31.4 million, or 32%. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 11% in 2007 and
9% in 2006. The improved operating income primarily resulted from higher revenues in our Research
and Consulting businesses. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled “Segment Results”
below for a further discussion of revenues and results by segment.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $22.2 million and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in our interest expense was due to a higher
weighted-average amount of debt outstanding in 2007. The increased interest expense from additional
debt outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in rates and higher interest income.

OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET was $3.2 million and $(0.8) million for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 2007 includes a gain from the settlement of a claim for
$1.8 million, while the majority of the remaining net balances in both years consists
of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $39.8 million for 2007 as compared to $26.4 million in
2006. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 36.0% as compared to 32.7% for 2006. The higher effective
tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 was attributable to several items. The most significant of
these items included the following: (a) the Company generated a smaller percentage of its income in
low tax jurisdictions in 2007 as compared to 2006, and (b) differences relating to the release of
valuation allowances and changes in reserves.

INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES, which includes the results of the
Company’s Vision Events business, was $2.9 million and $3.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

NET INCOME was $73.6 million and $58.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, an
increase of $15.4 million, or 26%.

Basic earnings per share was $0.71 per share in 2007 and $0.51 per share in 2006, while diluted was
$0.68 per share in 2007 and $0.50 per share in 2006. The basic and diluted earnings for both 2007
and 2006 includes $0.03 per share from discontinued operations.

2008 SEGMENT RESULTS

We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution
margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and
product development charges, and Selling, general and administrative expenses, Depreciation, META integration charges, Amortization
of intangibles and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a
percentage of revenues.



Research

Revenue in our Research business was up 15% in 2008, to $773.3 million, from $673.3 million for
2007. We had growth across our entire product portfolio in 2008. Excluding the favorable impact of
foreign currency, revenue was up approximately 14% over the prior year.

Research gross contribution increased to $507.7 million in 2008 from $429.1 million in 2007, an 18%
increase, while the contribution margin increased 2 points, to 66% from 64%. The year-over-year
contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue performance coupled with the
operating leverage inherent in our Research business, along with tight expense management.

Contract value was $834.3 million as of December 31, 2008, up 11% from $752.5 million at December
31, 2007. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was up
approximately 8%. At December 31, 2008, our research client retention rate remained strong at 82%,
the same rate as of December 31, 2007. Wallet retention was 98% at December 31, 2008, down from
101% at December 31, 2007. Our Executive Program membership was 3,733 at December 31, 2008,
compared to 3,753 members at December 31, 2007.

Consulting

Consulting revenues were $347.4 million and $325.0 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively, an
increase of $22.4 million, or 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation,
revenues for 2008 were up about 6%. The revenue increase was due to strength in both the core
Consulting and benchmarking businesses and exceptionally strong results in our contract
optimization business. Contributing to the year-over-year revenue increase in our contract
optimization business was the completion of one large contract in the fourth quarter of 2008 which
resulted in approximately $11.0 million of revenue.

Consulting gross contribution of $141.4 million for 2008 increased 10% from the $128.2 million for
2007, while the contribution margin for 2008 increased 2 points, to 41% from 39% in the prior year.
The increase in gross contribution and the gross contribution margin was driven by improved
utilization on higher headcount and higher billing rates, and higher revenues in our contract
optimization business, which has a higher margin than our core Consulting business.

Our consultant utilization rates were 72% and 69% for 2008 and 2007, respectively, while the $366
hourly billing rate was up about 3% year-over-year. Our billable headcount was 499 at December 31,
2008 compared to 472 at December 31, 2007. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount
was approximately $458,000 for 2008, about 7% higher than the prior year. These strong metrics
reflect improved engagement management and the continuation of our focus on larger and more
profitable engagements.

Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting,
measurement and SAS, was $97.2 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $121.4 million at December
31, 2007, as bookings slowed in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the weaker economic environment.

While we ended 2008 with 499 billable consultants, the reduction in force action we took in January
2009 reduced this number by approximately 30 consultants. This action was taken in order to better
align our delivery resources with the lower backlog as we move into 2009.

Events

Events revenues decreased 6% year-over-year, or $10.0 million, to $150.1 million in 2008 compared
to $160.1 million in 2007, reflecting lower revenues from both attendees and exhibitors. Excluding
the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, events revenues were down approximately 7%
year-over-year. We held 70 events in 2008 compared to 62 events in 2007, with overall attendance
down about 6%, to 41,352 in 2008 from 44,216 in 2007.

The 70 events held in 2008 included 59 on-going events and 11 new events. During 2008, the number
of exhibitors at our on-going events declined by approximately 13%, while attendance was 38,961 as
compared to 42,554 attendees in 2007, an 8% decrease. Pricing at these on-going events declined
slightly for attendees but increased slightly for exhibitors. Revenues from the 11 new events we held in 2008 was
only slightly higher than the events we discontinued. The majority of the year-over-year revenue
shortfall occurred in our fourth quarter, as travel restrictions, cuts in marketing budgets, and
other expense controls at many companies took effect in response to the credit crisis and weakening
global economy.



Events gross contribution was $65.0 million in 2008 compared to $81.9 million for 2007, while the
year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 8 points, to 43% from 51%. The decrease in
gross contribution margin was primarily due to lower revenues, higher fulfillment costs, the
impact of lower margin new events, and severance charges related to our reduction in force.

As a result of the travel restrictions and other budget cuts at many companies and the weakening
economy, we have reduced the number of events planned in 2009 to 54, which reflects the
discontinuance of 18 events, including our two Spring Symposia, as well as the launch of only two
smaller, new events. The 18 discontinued events had approximately $21.0 million of revenue in 2008.

2007 SEGMENT RESULTS

Research

Revenue in our Research business increased $102.1 million or 18% in 2007, to $673.3 million
compared to $571.2 million for 2006. We had year-over-year growth across our entire product
portfolio and in all of our geographic regions. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency,
revenue was up about 15% year-over-year. Research gross contribution increased to $429.1 million in
2007, from $345.5 million in 2006, a 24% increase, while the contribution margin increased 4
points, to 64% from 60%. The contribution margin improved primarily due to our stronger revenue
performance.

Contract value was $752.5 million at December 31, 2007, up 18% from $640.3 million at December 31,
2006. The year-over-year increase was driven by increases in both core research and Executive
Programs, and reflects the success of our new role-based product offerings. We had contract
value growth across all of our major geographic regions and client industry segments. Adjusted for
the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was up about 14%
year-over-year.

At December 31, 2007, our research client retention rate remained strong at 82%, up from 81% at
December 31, 2006. Wallet retention was 101% at December 31, 2007, up from 96% at December 31,
2006, reflecting higher spending at retained clients. Our Executive Program membership was 3,753 at
December 31, 2007, which is up about 3% over the prior year-end.

Consulting

Consulting revenues were $325.0 million in 2007, compared to $305.2 million in 2006, an increase of
6%, or $19.8 million, despite a decline in billable headcount. Excluding the favorable impact of
foreign currency translation, revenues were up 3% year-over-year. The increased revenue was driven
by substantial improvement in our contract optimization business as well as higher utilization and
billing rates in our core consulting business. Our contract optimization business was weak in the
fourth quarter of 2006 due to changes in sales incentives, which we rectified in 2007. Billable
headcount was 472 at December 31, 2007 compared to 518 at December 31, 2006, a 9% decrease. The
reduced billable headcount primarily reflects our decision to exit our consulting business in Asia.

Consulting gross contribution of $128.2 million in 2007 increased 6% from $120.7 million in 2006,
while contribution margin decreased 1 point, to 39% in 2007 from 40% in the prior year. The
decrease in gross contribution margin year-over-year was driven by lower SAS revenue performance
and additional investment in senior level consultants.

The consultant utilization rate was 69% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The billing rate remained above $350 per hour for both 2007 and 2006. Our average
annualized revenue per billable headcount was up about 5%, to approximately $430,000 in 2007 from
$410,000 in 2006. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from
in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, increased 11%, to $121.4 million at December 31, 2007
from $109.6 million at December 31, 2006.

Events

Events revenues for 2007 increased 9%, or $13.7 million, to $160.1 million compared to $146.4
million in 2006. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up
approximately 5%. We held 62 events in 2007 and 58 in 2006. The increased revenue was primarily due
to the addition of 10 new events in 2007 and an increase in both attendee volume and ticket prices.

Attendance at events was 44,216 in 2007, about an 8% increase over 2006. Gross contribution was
$81.9 million in 2007 compared to $75.4 million in 2006, a 9% increase, while gross contribution
margin was 51% in both 2007 and 2006.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from our on-going operating activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2008, we had cash from operating activities of $184.4 million,
approximately 24% higher than the $148.3 million realized in 2007. During 2008, we used $200.8
million of our cash to repurchase our common shares.

As of December 31, 2008, we had $140.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $178.3 million of
available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility (not including a $100.0 million
expansion feature). We believe that the cash we expect to earn from our on-going operating
activities, our existing cash balances, and the borrowing capacity we have under our five-year
revolving credit facility will be sufficient for our expected
short-term and foreseeable long-term operating needs.

The following sections discuss the Company’s changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three
years ending December 31, 2008:


Cash provided by operating activities totaled $184.4 million for the year December 31, 2008,
compared to cash provided of $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a $36.1 million,
or 24% increase. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to
substantially increased cash from our core operations and improvement in our working capital, which
together added approximately $45.0 million in higher operating cash flow. Our working capital
improved primarily due to improved collection of receivables. Also contributing to the improved
cash flow was $12.0 million in lower cash payments related to severance, excess facilities, and
settlement of litigation, and about $2.0 million less in interest paid on our debt as interest
rates declined. The improved operating cash flow in 2008 was somewhat offset by higher cash
payments for taxes and bonuses of approximately $23.0 million.

Cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared
to cash used of $24.1 million in 2007. We had capital expenditures of $24.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2008, which was offset by net cash proceeds from the sale of our Vision Events
business of approximately $7.8 million. We had capital expenditures of $24.2 million in 2007.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $119.8 million in 2008 compared to cash used of $93.7
million in 2007, an increase in cash used of $26.1 million. The increased use of cash was primarily
due to a significantly higher use of cash for stock repurchases in 2008. We used an additional
$34.0 million of cash to repurchase our shares in 2008, to $200.8 million in 2008 compared to
$166.8 million in 2007. Partially offsetting the additional use of cash used for stock repurchases
was an increase of $10.2 million in cash proceeds from stock issued for stock plans, which rose to
$44.7 million in 2008 compared to $34.5 million in 2007, driven by higher option exercises.

Our cash and cash equivalents was $140.9 million as of December 31, 2008, compared to $109.9
million at December 31, 2007. The effect of exchange rate changes decreased cash and cash
equivalents by approximately $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our cash and cash
equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with
55% held outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2008.


Cash provided by operating activities totaled $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
compared to cash provided of $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of
$42.1 million, or 40%. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an
increase in cash from our core operations of approximately $39.0 million, lower cash payments for
taxes of about $21.0 million, and to a lesser extent, lower cash payments for severance and other
items of $5.0 million. Offsetting these improvements was a payment of $9.5 million related to a
legal settlement and higher cash payments for interest on our outstanding debt of about $8.0
million, and a higher reduction from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $5.6
million.

Cash used in investing activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared
to $21.8 million in 2006. The increase was due to a year-over-year increase in capital
expenditures, which increased to $24.2 million in 2007 from $21.1 million in 2006.



Cash used in financing activities increased slightly, to $93.7 million for the year ended December
31, 2007, compared to $91.5 million in 2006. On a net basis, we borrowed $24.0 million in 2007
compared to $123.0 million in 2006, a decrease of $99.0 million year-over-year. We decreased our
use of cash to repurchase shares by $103.9 million, as we repurchased $166.8 million of our common
stock in 2007 compared to $270.7 million in 2006. We received proceeds from stock issued under
stock plans of $34.5 million in 2007, compared to $46.7 million in 2006, a decrease of $12.2
million. Excess tax benefits from stock compensation increased approximately $5.6 million, to $14.8
million in 2007 compared to $9.2 million in 2006.

At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $109.9 million. The effect of exchange
rates increased cash and cash equivalents by about $11.6 million during 2007.

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

At December 31, 2008, we had $416.3 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which provides
for two amortizing term loans and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit
facility may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our lenders’ discretion (the
“expansion feature”), for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. However, the $100.0
million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market
conditions.

The term loans are being repaid in consecutive quarterly installments plus a final payment due on
January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option. The
revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all
amounts borrowed must be repaid. See Note 6 — Debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information regarding the Company’s Credit Agreement.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
No. 141R”), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and
requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non controlling interest in the
acquiree, and the goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Statement requires that
adjustments to tax benefits related to the acquiree that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition
date will be recognized in income, rather than as an adjustment of goodwill under the current
rules. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the
beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which for Gartner is the
fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $8.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and
valuation allowances related to our acquisition of META. While the possibility exists that some
portion of these items may reverse in future periods, we believe the impact to our provision and
results of operations would not be significant. Accordingly, we do not believe the adoption of the
standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statement—amendments of ARB No. 51 (“SFAS No. 160”).” SFAS No. 160 requires the accounting and
reporting of minority interests as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures
that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the
noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial
statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an
outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary.
The statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after
December 15, 2008, which will be the Company’s fiscal
year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company does not believe the adoption of the standard will have
a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Interest Rate Risk

We have exposure to changes in interest rates resulting from $296.3 million outstanding on our two
term loans and $120.0 million outstanding on our revolver, all of which are floating rate
borrowings. Our borrowings may be either prime-based or Libor-based. Interest rates under these
borrowings include a base rate plus a margin between 0.00% and 0.75% on prime borrowings and
between .625% and 1.75% on Libor borrowings.

As of December 31, 2008, the annualized interest rates on the original 2007 term loan, the 2008
term loan, and revolver were 2.46%, 2.96%, and 1.47%, respectively. The rates on the original and
new term loans consisted of a three-month LIBOR base rate plus margins of 1.00% and 1.50% on the
original term loan and 2008 term loan, respectively. The rate on the revolver consisted of a
one-month LIBOR base rate plus a margin of 1.00%.

We have two interest rate swap contracts which effectively convert the floating base rates on the
term loans to fixed rates. Including the effect of the interest rate swaps, the annualized interest
rates on the original term loan and 2008 term loan were 6.06% and 4.42%, respectively, as of
December 31, 2008.

The Company does not hedge the interest rate risk on the revolver. Accordingly, we are still
exposed to interest rate risk on the revolver. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest
rates would change pre-tax annual interest expense on the $300.0 million revolver by approximately
$0.7 million when fully utilized.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We face two risks related to foreign currency exchange: translation risk and transaction risk.

Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates
in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders’ equity section of
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay
expenses in currencies other than the United States dollar. Since the functional currencies of our
foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries, the foreign
currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and do not
impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or
lower revenues and expenses in U.S. dollars as the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens against other
currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may affect our consolidated revenues and expenses
(as expressed in U.S. dollars) from foreign operations.

We are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk since we enter into foreign currency forward
exchange contracts to offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. These instruments are typically short term and are reflected at fair value with unrealized
and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2008, we had 15 foreign
currency forward contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of $73.4 million and a net
unrealized loss of $2.5 million. All of these contracts matured in January 2009.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist
primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and interest rate swap contracts. The majority of the Company’s cash equivalent
investments and its two interest rate swap contracts are with investment grade commercial banks
that are participants in the Company’s Credit Agreement. Accounts receivable balances deemed to be
collectible from customers have limited concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer
base and geographic dispersion.

ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

Our consolidated financial statements for 2008, 2007, and 2006, together with the reports of KPMG
LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, dated February 20, 2009, are included herein in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

None.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management conducted an evaluation, as of December 31, 2008, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, (as such term is defined in Rules 13a- 15(e)
and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) under the
supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to
material Company information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the
Act.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Gartner management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Gartner’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Management’s assessment was reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded
that, as of December 31, 2008, Gartner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended
December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our
internal controls over financial reporting.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries
(Gartner, Inc. or the Company) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2008. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as established by
the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and in accordance with the auditing standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Gartner Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
February 20, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Gartner, Inc.:

We have audited Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries (Gartner, Inc. or the Company) internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Gartner Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, Gartner, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Gartner, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
(deficit) equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 20, 2009 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

GARTNER, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of presentation

. The fiscal year of Gartner, Inc. (the “Company”) represents the period from
January 1 through December 31. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. When used in these notes, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean
Gartner, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Principles of consolidation

. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated. Investments in companies in which the Company owns less than 50% but have the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for
using the equity method. All other investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.

On April 1, 2005, the Company acquired META Group, Inc. (“META”), which was a technology and
research firm. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination. The
consolidated financial statements include the results of META from the date of acquisition.

Use of
estimates

. The preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of
assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets
and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such
estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, goodwill,
intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, as well as tax
accruals and other liabilities. In addition, estimates are used in
revenue recognition, income tax expense, stock-based compensation
charges, depreciation and amortization, and the allowance for loan
losses. Management believes its use of estimates in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements to be reasonable.

Management
evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using historical
experience and other factors, to include the general economic
environment. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances
dictate. However, these estimates may involve significant
uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision.
In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a
point in time.

The
current global credit crisis and economic downturn, volatile foreign
currency rates, and cuts in travel, marketing and technology budgets
have combined to increase the risks and uncertainty inherent in such
estimates. These external factors have increased the risks the
Company’s faces as it relates in particular to estimates
regarding the collection of receivables and the valuation of goodwill.

As future
events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual
results could differ significantly from the estimates we have used.
Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing weakness in the
economic environment could be material and would be reflected in the
Company’s financial statements in future periods.

Revenues and commission expense recognition

. The Company typically enters into annually renewable
subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and
recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. The Company records the commission obligation
related to research contracts upon the signing of the contract and amortizes the corresponding
deferred commission expense over the contract period in which the related revenues are earned.

The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a
limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable,
except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses, which have
not produced material cancellations to date. With the exception of certain government contracts
which permit termination and contracts with special billing terms, it is Company policy to record
the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is
signed, which represents a legally enforceable claim, and a corresponding amount as deferred
revenue. For those government contracts that permit termination, the Company bills the client the
full amount billable under the contract but only records a receivable equal to the earned portion
of the contract. In addition, the Company only records deferred revenue on these government
contracts when cash is received.

Deferred revenue attributable to government contracts was $61.6 million and $57.6 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
had not recognized receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit
termination of $12.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively, which had been billed but not yet
collected.

Consulting revenues, primarily derived from consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services
(paid one-day analyst engagements), are principally generated from fixed fee or time and materials
for discrete projects. Revenues for such projects are recognized as work is delivered and/or
services are provided. Unbilled fees receivables associated with consulting engagements were $35.3
million at December 31, 2008, and $35.8 million at December 31, 2007. Revenues related to contract
optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all
conditions related to their payment.

Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium,
conference or exhibition. In addition, the Company defers certain costs directly related to events
and expenses these costs in the period during which the related symposium, conference or exhibition
occurs. The Company policy is to defer only those costs, primarily prepaid site and production
services costs, which are incremental and are directly attributable to a specific event. Other
costs of organizing and producing our events, primarily Company personnel and non-event specific
expenses, are expensed in the period incurred. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the



Company assesses on an event-by-event basis whether expected direct costs of producing a scheduled
event will exceed expected revenues. If such costs are expected to exceed revenues, the Company
records the expected loss in the period determined.

Other revenues consist primarily of fees from research reprints. Reprint fees are recognized when
the reprint is shipped.

Cash and cash equivalents

. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates
fair value based upon their short-term maturity. Investments with maturities of more than three
months are classified as marketable securities.

Property leases

. Costs to lease facilities, including contractual rent concessions and rent
increases, are expensed ratably over the life of the lease. This expense was $22.5 million in 2008,
$23.8 million in 2007, and $22.6 million for 2006.

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements

. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
lives of the assets or the remaining term of the related leases. Property, equipment and leasehold
improvements, less accumulated depreciation and amortization consist of the following (in
thousands):

Total depreciation expense was $25.9 million, $24.3 million, and $23.4 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, capitalized development costs for internal use software were $19.6
million and $18.6 million, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $18.9 million and $12.4
million, respectively. Amortization of capitalized internal software development costs, which is
included in Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, totaled $7.4 million, $6.5
million, and $4.6 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Intangible assets

. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their
expected useful lives. Customer relationships are amortized over five years, while noncompete
agreements are generally amortized over two to five years.

Goodwill

. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the
estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired. Under SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
impairment, at least annually, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be an operating
segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management.
Under the impairment test, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value,
goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit’s carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value of reporting units is
estimated using discounted cash flows, market multiples, and other valuation techniques.

The changes to the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting segment during 2008 and the balance at
December 31, 2008, follows (in thousands):

(1) The Company reduced Research goodwill by $0.5 million due to a META tax purchase accounting
adjustment. The adjustment relates to the utilization or anticipated utilization of net
operating losses for which a valuation was recorded at the acquisition date.

(2) The Company reduced Events segment goodwill by $1.8 million related to the sale of its
Visions Events business in February 2008 (see Note 2 — Discontinued Operations).

Impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets

. The Company reviews long-lived assets and
intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the respective asset may not be recoverable. Such evaluation
may be based on a number of factors including current and projected operating results and cash
flows, changes in management’s strategic direction as well as other economic and market variables.
The Company’s policy regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill is to
evaluate the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the balance can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Should events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying value might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future operating cash flows, an
impairment loss would be recognized. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on the
difference between projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate
reflecting the Company’s average cost of funds and the carrying value of the asset.

Pension obligations.

The Company has defined-benefit pension plans in several of its international
locations (see Note 13— Employee Benefits). Benefits earned under these plans are based on years
of service and level of employee compensation. The Company accounts for material defined benefit
plans in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, —
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” as amended (SFAS No. 87). Under SFAS No. 87, the benefit
obligation and related benefit expense is based on actuarial assumptions and valuations. The
Company had $2.2 million, $2.7 million, and $2.9 million of expense under these plans in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively.

Foreign currency translation

. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net within the Stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency of a subsidiary are included in results of operations within Other income
(expense), net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net currency transaction (losses)
gains were $(1.6) million in 2008, $1.1 million in 2007, and $(0.6) million during 2006.

We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts generally have a short maturity
and are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in Other
income (expense). During 2008, the net loss from these contracts was $(0.6) million. At December
31, 2008, the Company had 15 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a total notional
value of $73.4 million. All of these contracts expired in January 2009.



Income taxes

. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the
book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates. The provision for
income taxes is the sum of the amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by
applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to taxable income for that year and the net changes
during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We credit additional paid-in capital for
realized tax benefits arising from stock transactions with employees. The tax benefit on a
nonqualified stock option is equal to the tax effect of the difference between the market price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price.

Sales taxes.

Sales tax collected from customers remitted to governmental authorities is presented
on a net basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair value disclosures

. The Company’s fair value disclosures are included in Note 12—Fair Value
Disclosures.

Concentrations of credit risk

.

Items that potentially subject the Company to concentration of
credit risk at December 31, 2008 consist primarily of short-term, highly liquid investments
classified as cash equivalents, accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, and a pension reinsurance
asset. The majority of the Company’s cash equivalent investments and its two interest rate swap
contracts are with investment grade commercial banks that are participants in the Company’s Credit
Agreement. Accounts receivable balances deemed to be collectible from customers have limited
concentration of credit risk due to our diverse customer base and geographic dispersion. The
Company’s pension reinsurance asset is maintained with a large international insurance company that
was rated investment grade as of December 31, 2008.

Stock repurchase programs

. The Company records the cost to repurchase its own shares to treasury
stock. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded $198.6 million, $169.1 million, and $269.2
million, respectively, of stock repurchases (see Note 8—Equity). Shares repurchased by the Company
are added to treasury shares and are not retired

.

Accounting for stock-based compensation

. On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), as interpreted by
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”). Stock-based compensation cost is based on
the fair value of the award on the date of grant, which is expensed over the related service
period, net of forfeitures. The service period is the period over which the employee performs the
related services, which is normally the same as the vesting period. The Company adopted SFAS No.
123(R) under the modified prospective transition method, and consequently prior period results have
not been restated. Under this transition method, the Company’s reported stock compensation expense
includes: a) expense related to the remaining unvested portion of awards granted prior to January
1, 2006, which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123; and b) expense related to stock compensation awards granted subsequent
to January 1, 2006, which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company applied APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”) in accounting for its employee stock compensation and applied Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“SFAS 123”) for
disclosure purposes only. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method was used to account for
stock-based employee compensation plans and expense was not recorded for awards that did not have
intrinsic value.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company had $20.7 million, $24.2 million, and $16.7 million,
respectively, of stock-based compensation expense (see Note 9—Stock-Based Compensation).

Recent accounting developments.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
No. 141R”), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and
requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non controlling interest in the
acquiree, and the goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Statement requires that
adjustments to tax benefits related to the acquiree that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition
date will be recognized in income, rather than as an adjustment of goodwill under the current
rules. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the
beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which for Gartner is the
fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statement—amendments of ARB No. 51 (“SFAS No. 160”).” SFAS No. 160 requires the accounting and
reporting of minority interests as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures
that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the
noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160



applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit
organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest
in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The statement is effective as of
the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, which will be the
Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009.

2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In February 2008 the Company sold its Vision Events business, which had been part of the Company’s
Events segment, for $11.4 million in cash. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the operating results of the Vision Events business
have been reported separately as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The Vision
Events business generated revenues of zero, $20.7 million, and $23.0 million in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively, and had operating (loss) income of $(0.3) million, $2.9 million and $3.9
million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The Company realized net cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $7.8 million. The Company
recorded a net gain on the sale of approximately $7.1 million after deducting direct costs to sell,
a charge of $1.8 million of Events segment goodwill, and related tax charges. The gain is recorded
in Income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The goodwill
charge was recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which
requires an allocated portion of goodwill to be included in the gain or loss on disposal of a
portion of a reporting unit. As of December 31, 2007, the recorded assets and liabilities of the
Vision Events business consisted primarily of $3.3 million of accounts receivable and prepaid
expenses, while recorded liabilities consisted primarily of $3.4 million of deferred revenues.
These amounts were not material to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet or Cash Flow
as of December 31, 2007.


—OTHER CHARGES

The Company recorded Other charges of $0 in 2008, $9.1 million in 2007, and $0 in 2006.

Other charges of $9.1 million recorded in 2007 included charges of $8.7 million related to a
litigation settlement and $2.7 million related to our decision to exit consulting operations in
Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility.

The $8.7 million litigation settlement charge in 2007 related to a settlement agreement the Company
entered into with Expert Choice, Inc. and the Company’s insurance carriers to settle all claims,
causes of action and disputes arising out of the litigation entitled

Expert Choice, Inc. v.
Gartner, Inc., U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, Civil Docket 3:03cv02234

.

The
settlement agreement provided for full and complete mutual releases among the parties, dismissal of
the litigation and resolved all disputes between the parties. The total amount of the settlement
was $21.5 million, of which $9.5 million was paid by the Company, and an aggregate of $12.0 million
was paid by the Company’s insurers. In addition to the $8.7 million charge recorded in 2007, the
Company had previously accrued $1.0 million toward the settlement of this matter.

The Company also recorded a charge of $2.7 million in 2007 for severance and benefits costs related
to the Company’s decision to exit from consulting operations in Asia, which resulted in a reduction
of 31 consultants. In addition, the Company also recorded a credit of approximately $2.3 million to
reduce an accrual related to an excess facility, which was returned to service. The Company had
recorded the original accrual for this excess facility in 2002.

6—DEBT

Credit Agreement

The Company has a Credit Agreement dated as of January 31, 2007 that provides for a $300.0 million
revolving credit facility and a five-year, $180.0 million term loan (the “original term loan”). On
April 9, 2008, the Company entered into a First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) with the lenders
to the Credit Agreement, which provided for a new $150.0 million term loan (the “2008 term loan”).
The revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at the discretion
of the Company’s lenders (the “expansion feature”), for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0
million. However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may not be available to the Company
depending upon prevailing credit market conditions. To date the Company has not sought to borrow
under the expansion feature.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement carry interest rates that are either prime-based or
Libor-based. Interest rates under these borrowings include a base rate plus a margin between 0.00%
and 0.75% on Prime-based borrowings and between 0.625% and 1.75% on Libor-based borrowings.
Generally, the Company’s borrowings are Libor-based. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid
and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The
revolver borrowing capacity is reduced for both amounts outstanding under the revolver and for
letters of credit.

The original term loan will be repaid in 18 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced on
September 30, 2007, with the final payment due on January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time
without penalty or premium at the option of the Company. The 2008 term loan is co-terminus with
the original 2007 term loan under the Credit Agreement and will be repaid in 16 consecutive
quarterly installments which commenced June 30, 2008, plus a final payment due on January 31, 2012,
and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at the option of Gartner.

The Credit
Agreement contains certain customary restrictive loan covenants,
including, among others, financial covenants requiring a maximum
leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum
annualized contract value ratio and covenants limiting Gartner’s
ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make acquisitions, be
acquired, dispose of assets, pay dividends, repurchase stock, make
capital expenditures, and make investments.

The Company was in full compliance with its debt covenants
as of December 31, 2008. A failure to comply with these covenants in
the future could result in acceleration of all amounts outstanding
under the Credit Agreement, which would materially impact our
financial condition unless accommodations could be negotiated with
our lenders.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $416.3 million in total debt outstanding under the Credit
Agreement, which included $157.5 million outstanding under the original term loan, $138.8 million
outstanding under the 2008 term loan, and $120.0 million outstanding under the revolver. The
Company had approximately $178.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the $300.0 million
revolving credit facility (not including the expansion feature) as of December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, the annualized interest rates on the original term loan, 2008 term loan,
and revolver were 2.46%, 2.96%, and 1.47%, respectively. The rates on the original term loan and
2008 term loan consisted of a three-month LIBOR base rate plus margins of 1.00% and 1.50%,
respectively. The rate on the revolver consisted of a one-month LIBOR base rate plus a margin of
1.00%. For 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company had $22.4 million, $25.1 million, and $19.1 million,
respectively, in interest expense, which includes amounts related to debt outstanding and interest
received/paid on the interest rate swaps discussed below.

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

The Company has two interest rate swap contracts that hedge the base interest rate risk on its two
term loans. The effect of the swaps is to convert the floating base rates on the term loans to
fixed rates. Under the swap terms, the Company pays a fixed rate and in return receives a
three-month LIBOR rate. The three-month LIBOR rate received on the swaps matches the base rate paid
on the term loans since the Company optionally selects a three-month LIBOR rate on the term loans.
Both of the interest rate swaps are amortizing swaps such that the notional value of the swaps
declines over time and constantly matches the outstanding amounts of the term loans. Including the
effect of the interest rate swaps, the annualized interest rates on the original term loan and 2008
term loan were 6.06% and 4.42%, respectively, as of December 31, 2008.

The Company accounts for the swaps as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”). SFAS No. 133 requires all
derivatives, whether designated as hedges or not, to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. Since the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair values
of the swaps are recorded in Other comprehensive income as long as the swaps continue to
effectively hedge the base interest rate risk on the respective term loans. Any ineffective portion
of changes in the fair value of the hedges is recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2008, there was
no ineffective portion of the hedges as defined under SFAS No. 133. The two interest rate swaps had
a net negative fair value of approximately $14.7 million at December 31, 2008, which is recorded in
Other comprehensive income, net of tax effect.



Letters of Credit

The Company issues letters of credit and related guarantees in the ordinary course of business. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding letters of credit and guarantees of approximately
$3.8 million.

7—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer equipment under operating lease
arrangements expiring between 2009 and 2025. The future minimum annual cash payments under
non-cancelable operating lease agreements at December 31, 2008, are as follows (in thousands):

We are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We
believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued from all
proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations when resolved in a future period.

The Company has various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party with respect
to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in
the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless
against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets
sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights. It is not possible to predict the
maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the
conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement.
Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not been material. As of December 31,
2008, we did not have any indemnification agreements that would require material payments.

The Company received cash proceeds of $1.2 million in 2008 related to the settlement of a
litigation matter and $1.8 million in 2007 related to the settlement of a claim. These amounts were
recorded as gains in Other (expense) income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

8—EQUITY

Capital stock

. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be
voted by stockholders. The Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock. Also,
our credit arrangement contains a negative covenant which may limit our ability to pay dividends.
In addition, our Amended and Restated Security Holders Agreement with Silver Lake requires us to
obtain Silver Lake’s consent prior to declaring or paying dividends.

Share repurchase programs.

In February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new
program to repurchase up to $200.0 million of Gartner common stock, which the Board of Directors
supplemented in February 2008 with an additional $250.0 million authorization for share
repurchases. The new program replaced the repurchase program approved in October 2005.

Repurchases under the program are generally made from time-to-time through open market purchases.
Repurchases are subject to the availability of stock, prevailing market conditions, the trading
price of the stock, the Company’s financial performance and other conditions. Repurchases will be
funded from cash flow from operations and possible borrowings under the Company’s Credit Agreement.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company had $198.6 million, $169.1 million, and $269.2 million,
respectively, of common share repurchases. Included in these totals is $26.9 million and $200.0
million for shares repurchased directly from Silver Lake in 2008 and 2006, respectively.

Adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108

. The Company adopted SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB No. 108”) effective the beginning of the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006. SAB No. 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality
assessment. SAB No. 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement
errors based on the effects on each of the Company’s financial statements and related financial
statement disclosures.

In accordance with the requirements of SAB No. 108, the Company adjusted its opening accumulated
earnings for 2006 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity and
Comprehensive Income for the three items described below. The net impact of these
adjustments increased the Company’s opening balance of accumulated earnings for 2006 by
approximately $3.2 million and increased the opening balance of additional paid-in-capital by
approximately $7.2 million. The Company considered these adjustments to be immaterial to its
Consolidated Statements of Operations and its Consolidated Balance Sheets in prior periods.

The Company recorded an adjustment of $10.7 million related to an overstatement of current taxes
payable, resulting in an increase to opening accumulated earnings of $7.4 million and a $3.3
million increase to opening additional paid-in capital. The adjustment had no impact on tax
expense. The adjustment was due to the carryover impact of an excess payable balance from prior
years in the current taxes payable account which had accumulated over a period of years prior to
2000.

Prior to October 1999, the exercise price of stock options granted to employees under the Company’s
stock option plans was equal to the average of the closing price of the Company’s common stock for
the five trading days immediately preceding the grant date. In 2006, the Company determined that
for valuation purposes, the exercise price should have been the closing price on the date of grant
(which is the formula used by the Company since October 1999). Accordingly, the Company revalued
options granted prior to October 1999 using the closing price on the date of grant and determined
that an additional $6.0 million of compensation expense should have been recorded. The cumulative
effect of the adjustment resulted in a reduction of opening accumulated earnings of approximately
$3.8 million, an increase to additional paid-in capital of $3.9 million, and a tax effect of less
than $0.1 million.

Lastly, the Company recorded an adjustment of $0.7 million related to a correction in the
accounting treatment of certain operating leases, which resulted in a reduction of opening
accumulated earnings of approximately $0.4 million, net of tax effect of $0.3 million. Promulgated
accounting principles require contractual rent concessions and rent increases to be applied ratably
over the life of the operating lease. The Company only applied this requirement to operating leases
above a certain threshold, with the resulting adjustment amount accumulating over a period of
years.

9—STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company grants stock-based compensation awards as an incentive for employees and directors to
contribute to the Company’s long-term success. The Company’s stock compensation awards include
stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, service- and
performance-based restricted stock units, and common stock equivalents. At December 31, 2008, the
Company had approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock available for awards of stock-based
compensation under its 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan.



The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards 123(R), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), as interpreted by SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletins No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”) and No. 110 (“SAB No. 110”). Under SFAS No. 123(R),
stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant,
which is recognized over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The service
period is the period over which the related service is performed, which is generally the same as
the vesting period. At the present time, the Company issues treasury shares upon the exercise or
settlement of stock-based compensation awards.

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation
awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the
expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company’s common stock price volatility. In
addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to
estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of the achievement of certain
performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation
awards and the associated periodic expense represent management’s best estimates, but these
estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors
change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use
different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company’s stock-based compensation
awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation
expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period.

The Company recognized the following amounts of stock-based compensation expense under
SFAS No. 123(R) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the years ended December 31 (in millions):

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $40.5 million of total unrecognized stock-based
compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the
remaining weighted-average service period of approximately 2.1 years. Currently, the Company issues
treasury shares upon the exercise or settlement of stock-based compensation awards.

Stock-Based Compensation Awards

The following disclosures provide information regarding the Company’s stock-based compensation
awards, all of which are classified as equity awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R):

Stock Options

The Company may grant stock options to employees that allow them to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock at a certain price. The Company determines the fair value of stock options
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Options vest annually over a
four-year vesting period, and options granted prior to 2005 expire ten years from the grant date,
whereas options granted beginning in 2005 generally expire seven years from the grant date. The
Company has not made new stock option awards since 2006.

The Company recognized $1.9 million, $5.8 million, and $7.9 million of expense related to stock
options in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. There was no remaining unamortized cost related to
stock options as of December 31, 2008. The Company received $42.0 million and $31.7 million of cash
from stock option exercises in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stock Appreciation Rights

Stock-settled stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are settled in common shares and are similar to
options as they permit the holder to participate in the appreciation of the Company’s common stock.
SARs may be settled in common shares by the employee once the applicable vesting criteria have been
met. When SARs are exercised, the number of Gartner common shares awarded is calculated as follows:
(1) the total proceeds from the SARs exercise (the closing price of Gartner common stock on the
date of exercise less the exercise price of the SARs, multiplied by the number of SARs exercised)
is divided by (2) the closing price of Gartner common stock on the exercise date. The Company will
withhold a portion of the common shares issuable upon exercise to satisfy minimum statutory tax
withholding requirements. SARs recipients do not have any of the rights of a Gartner stockholder,
including voting rights and the right to receive dividends and distributions, until after actual
shares of common stock are issued in respect of the award, which is subject to the prior
satisfaction of the vesting and other criteria relating to such grants. At the present time, SARs
are awarded only to the Company’s executive officers.

The Company determines the fair value of SARs on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton
valuation model. The SARs vest ratably over a four-year service period and they expire seven years
from the grant date. Total compensation expense for SARs was $3.2 million, $2.4 million, and $1.0
million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

The fair value of the Company’s SARs was determined on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the years
ended December 31:

(1)

The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of the Company’s
dividend payouts. Historically Gartner has not paid cash dividends on its common stock.

(2)

The determination of expected stock price volatility was based on both historical Gartner
common stock prices and implied volatility from publicly traded options in Gartner common
stock.

(3)

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity
similar to the expected life of the award.

(4)

The expected life in years is based on the “simplified” calculation provided for in SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The simplified method determines the expected life in years based
on the vesting period and contractual terms as set forth when the award is made. The Company
continues to use the simplified method for awards of stock-based compensation after January 1,
2008 as permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (“SAB No. 110”), since it does not have
the necessary historical exercise and forfeiture data to determine an expected life for SARs.
Originally, the use of the simplified method was due to expire on December 31, 2007, but SAB
No. 110 permits continued use of the simplified method if the Company concludes that it is not
reasonable to base its estimate of expected term on its experience with historical exercise
patterns.

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Common Stock Equivalents

Restricted stock awards give the awardee the right to vote the restricted common shares and to
receive dividends and distributions on these shares; however, the awardee may not sell the
restricted shares until all restrictions on the release of the shares have lapsed and the shares
are released. Restricted stock units (RSUs) give the awardee the right to receive Gartner common
shares when the restrictions lapse and the vesting conditions are met, and each RSU that vests
entitles the awardee to one common share. RSU awardees do not have any of the rights of a Gartner
stockholder, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends and distributions, until
after the common shares are released. Common stock equivalents (CSEs) are convertible into Gartner
common shares, and each CSE entitles the holder to one common share. Certain members of our Board
of Directors receive directors’ fees payable in CSEs unless they opt for cash payment. Generally,
the CSEs are converted when service as a director terminates.

The fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), and common stock equivalents
(CSEs) is determined on the date of grant based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock
as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on that date. The fair value of these awards is
recognized as compensation expense as follows: (i) outstanding restricted stock awards vest based
on the achievement of a market condition and are expensed on a straight-line basis over three
years; (ii) service-based RSUs vest ratably over four years and are expensed on a straight-line
basis over four years; (iii) performance-based RSUs are subject to both performance and service
conditions, vest ratably over four years, and are expensed on an accelerated basis as required by
SFAS No. 123(R); and (iv) CSEs vest immediately and are recorded as expense on the date of grant.

(1)

The 1.3 million RSUs granted in 2008 consisted of 0.5 million performance-based RSUs awarded
to executives and 0.8 million service-based RSUs awarded to executive and non-executive
staff.

The number of performance-based RSUs awarded was subject to the achievement of a performance
condition tied to the annual increase in the Company’s subscription-based contract value for
2008, which ranged from 0% and 200% of the target number awarded depending on the performance
level achieved. The aggregate target performance-based RSUs awarded in 2008 was 0.6 million. The
actual performance target achieved was 75.1%, resulting in 0.5 million performance-based RSUs
awarded.

(2)

CSEs represent fees paid to directors. The CSEs vest when granted and are convertible into
common shares when the director leaves the Board of Directors or earlier if the director
elects to accelerate the release.

(3)

Vesting on the 200,000 shares of restricted stock held by our CEO is subject to a market
condition as follows: (i) 100,000 shares will vest when the Company’s common stock trades at
an average price of $25 or more each trading day for sixty consecutive trading days; and (ii)
100,000 shares will vest when the Company’s common stock trades at an average price of $30 or
more each trading day for sixty consecutive trading days.

(4)

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of the RSUs is 1.3 years. The restricted
stock has no defined contractual term.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP Plan”) under which eligible employees
are permitted to purchase Gartner common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10%
of an employee’s compensation (or $23,750 in any calendar year), at a price equal to 95% of the
common stock price as reported by the New York Stock Exchange at the end of each offering period.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had 1.8 million shares available for purchase under the ESPP
Plan. The ESPP Plan is considered non-compensatory under SFAS No. 123(R), and as a result the
Company does not record compensation expense related to employee share purchases. The Company
received $2.7 million in cash from share purchases under the Plan in the year ended December 31,
2008.

10—COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of
securities that could share in earnings. When the impact of stock options or other stock-based
compensation is antidilutive they are excluded from the calculation.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per share
computations (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Basic and diluted include income from discontinued operations of $0.07 per share, $0.03 per

The following table presents the number of options and other share equivalents that were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS in the table above because the effect would have been
antidilutive. During periods with reported income, these options and other share equivalents were
antidilutive because their exercise prices were greater than the average market value of a share of
common stock during the period. During periods with reported loss, all options and other share
equivalents outstanding would have an antidilutive effect.

Current net deferred tax assets and net deferred tax liabilities were $15.7 million and $2.8
million as of December 31, 2008 and $7.8 million and $4.9 as of December 31, 2007, respectively,
and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long-term net deferred tax assets and net deferred
tax liabilities were $46.4 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2008, and $55.8 million and
$0.3 million as of December 31, 2007, respectively, and are included in Other assets and Other
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The valuation allowances in 2008 and 2007 relate primarily to non-U.S. net operating losses,
domestic capital loss carryforwards, and domestic foreign tax credits that more likely than not
will expire unutilized. The net decrease in valuation allowance of $13.4 million in 2008 relates
primarily to the following items: (a) the release of approximately $9.4 million of valuation
allowances for changes in both actual and anticipated utilization of foreign tax credits and (b)
the release of approximately $2.6 million of valuation allowances on federal and state capital loss
carryovers due to both utilization and expiration of the capital loss carryovers.

The Company has established a full valuation allowance against domestic realized and unrealized
capital losses, as the future utilization of these losses is uncertain. As of December 31, 2008,
the Company had U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards of $5.1 million, of which $5.0 million will
expire in 2010 and $0.1 million will expire in 2011. The Company also had $7.3 million in state and
local capital loss carryforwards that will expire over a similar time period.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had state and local tax net operating loss carryforwards of
$181.2 million, of which $6.9 million will expire within one to five years, $107.0 million will
expire within six to fifteen years, and $67.3 million will expire within sixteen to twenty years.
In addition, the Company had non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $37.6 million, of which
$6.2 million will expire over the next 20 years and $31.4 million that can be carried forward
indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2008 the Company also had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $15.0 million, all
of which will expire in 2017.

The Company adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had
gross unrecognized tax benefits of $16.3 million and $18.1 million, respectively. The reduction is
primarily attributable to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation in the second quarter of
2008. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits will be decreased by $2.1
million within the next 12 months due primarily to the expiration of the relevant statutes of
limitation. The nature of the uncertainty relates to the tax effects of intercompany charges and
the deductibility of certain expenses.

FIN 48 also requires companies to reclassify uncertain tax positions not expected to be settled
within one year to long term liabilities. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had Other
Liabilities of $14.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively, related to long term uncertain tax
positions.

Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company elected an accounting policy to classify accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its income tax provision. Previously, the policy
classified interest and penalties as an operating expense in arriving at pretax income. The
Company had $3.6 million and $2.5 million of accrued interest and penalties recorded as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to the unrecognized tax benefits. These amounts are in
addition to the gross unrecognized tax benefits noted above. The total amount of interest and
penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ending December 31,
2008 and 2007 was $1.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

In December 2008, the Company repatriated $55.0 million from its foreign subsidiary. The cost of
the repatriation was offset with the utilization of foreign tax credits and capital loss carryovers
against which a valuation allowance was previously established.

The number of years with open statues of limitation varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.
Generally, our statutes are open for tax years ended September 30, 2004 and forward. Major taxing
jurisdictions include the U.S. (federal and state), the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Japan, and
Ireland.

The Company received Examination Reports from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) in October 2005
and October 2006 in connection with audits of the Company’s federal income tax returns for the tax
years ended September 30, 1999 through December 31, 2004. On February 27, 2008, the Company
received official written notification that the case had cleared the IRS Joint Committee, which
officially closes the IRS audit for those periods.

The
Company recently received notice that the IRS intends to conduct
an audit of the 2007 tax year. The Company does not expect any material impact on its financial
position as a result of such review.

Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. amounted to approximately $12.8 million
as of December 31, 2008. The Company intends to reinvest such
earnings in non-U.S. operations. However, the Company may repatriate
a portion of these earnings to the extent that it does not incur an
additional U.S. tax liability. Accordingly, no provision
for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon.

12—FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, fees receivable from
customers, accounts payable, and accruals which are short-term in nature. The Company believes the
carrying amounts of these financial instruments reasonably approximates their fair value.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $416.3 million of outstanding floating rate debt and two
interest rate swap contracts (see Note 6— Debt), as well as foreign currency forward contracts
(see Note 1— Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). These items are all considered financial
instruments. The Company’s debt is carried at amortized cost while the interest rate swaps and
forward contracts are carried at fair value. The Company believes the carrying amount of the debt
approximates its fair value as the rate of interest on the term loans and revolver are floating
rate which reflect current market rates of interest for similar instruments with comparable
maturities. Additional information regarding the determination of the fair value of the interest
rate swaps and the forward contracts is discussed below.

Adoption of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements

On January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No.
157”), which required additional disclosures but did not have an impact on our consolidated
financial statements. The Company only partially adopted SFAS No. 157 due to the issuance of FASB
Staff Position (“FSP”) FASB 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP No. 157-2”).

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a common framework for measuring fair value under U.S.
GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities. SFAS No.
157 does not require additional assets or liabilities to be



accounted for at fair value beyond that already required under other U.S. GAAP accounting
standards. FSP No. 157-2 deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). Included in the scope of FSP No. 157-2 are
nonfinancial assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations and impaired assets. The
effective date for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities was delayed by one year to
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company continues to assess the deferred portion of SFAS No. 157.

Under SFAS No. 157, the framework for measuring fair value and a valuation hierarchy is based upon
the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability. Classification within
the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the resulting fair
value measurement. The valuation hierarchy contains three levels:

•

Level 1 — Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2 — Valuation inputs are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active, quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets
and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being
measured.

•

Level 3 — Valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table presents Company assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis (in thousands):

(1)

The Company has a supplemental deferred compensation arrangement for the benefit of certain
highly compensated officers, managers and other key employees (see Note 13—Employee Benefits). The
plan’s assets consist of $4.5 million of investments in money market and mutual funds, and $9.4
million of company-owned life insurance. The money market and mutual funds consist of cash
equivalents or securities traded in active markets, which the Company considers the fair value of
these assets to be based on Level 1 inputs as defined by SFAS No. 157. The value of the
Company-owned life insurance is based on indirect observable inputs which the Company considers to
be Level 2.

(2)

The Company had 15 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2008, with
a notional value of $73.4 million. All of these contracts expired by the end of January 2009. The
Company periodically enters into these foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the
effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These instruments are typically
short term in duration and are recorded at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses
recorded in earnings. Valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign
currency exchange rates in active markets, thus the Company measures the fair value of these
contracts under a Level 2 input as defined by SFAS No. 157.

(3)

The Company has two interest rate swap contracts that hedge the base interest rate risk on its
term loans. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
The fair value of the swaps is recorded in Other comprehensive income, net of tax effect (see Note
6—Debt). To determine the value of the swaps, the Company relies on a mark-to-market valuations
prepared by third-party brokers based on observable interest rate yield curves. Accordingly, the
fair value of the swaps is determined under a Level 2 input as defined by SFAS No. 157.



13—EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Savings and investment plan.

The Company has a savings and investment plan covering substantially
all domestic employees. Company contributions are based upon the level of employee contributions,
up to a maximum of 4% of the employee’s eligible salary, subject to an annual maximum. For 2008, the maximum match was $6,200. In addition, the Company also
contributes at least 1% of an employee’s base compensation, subject to an IRS annual limitation of
$2,300 for 2008. Amounts expensed in connection with the plan totaled $12.5 million, $11.8 million,
and $10.9 million, for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Deferred compensation arrangement.

The Company has a supplemental deferred compensation arrangement
for the benefit of certain highly compensated officers, managers and other key employees which is
structured as a rabbi trust. We classify the plan’s investment assets in Other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at current fair value, and the value of the assets was $13.9 million
and $18.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The corresponding deferred
compensation liability of $16.5 million and $21.9 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, is recorded at fair market value, and is adjusted with a corresponding charge or
credit to compensation cost to reflect the fair value of the amount owed to the employee and is
included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total compensation (benefit)
expense for the arrangement was $(0.4) million, $0.3 million, and $0.3 million, for 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.

Defined benefit pension plans.

The Company has defined-benefit pension plans in several of its
international locations. Benefits earned under these plans are based on years of service and level
of employee compensation. The Company accounts for material defined benefit plans in accordance
with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, — “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions,” as amended (SFAS No. 87).

On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88, 106, and 132R” (“SFAS No. 158”). The standard requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its
statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s
underfunded status; (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded
status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize
changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the
changes occur.

(1)

The Company has a reinsurance asset arrangement with a large international insurance company
that was rated investment grade as of December 31, 2008. The purpose of the reinsurance asset
arrangement is to fund the benefit obligation under one of the plans. However, the reinsurance
asset is not recognized as a plan asset under SFAS No. 87 since it is considered an asset of
the Company and is not legally segregated or restricted for purposes of meeting the pension
obligation. The reinsurance asset is carried at its cash surrender value, which the Company
believes approximates its fair value as of December 31, 2008.

(2)

Contributions expected to be paid to the plans in 2009 are $0.1 million.

(3)

The $2.8 million recorded in Stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2008, represents the
plan’s net unrecognized actuarial gain. This amount is recorded in accordance with SFAS No.
158 and will be amortized to net periodic pension cost over approximately 15 years.
Amortization of the gain is estimated to reduce net periodic pension cost in 2009 by
approximately $0.2 million.

14—SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company manages its business in three reportable segments: Research, Consulting and Events.
Research consists primarily of subscription-based research products, access to research inquiry, as
well as peer networking services and membership programs. Consulting consists primarily of
consulting, measurement engagements, and strategic advisory services. Events consists of various
symposia, conferences and exhibitions.

The Company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocates resources based on gross
contribution margin. Gross contribution, as presented below, is defined as operating income
excluding certain Cost of services and product development and SGA expenses, depreciation, META
integration charges, amortization of intangibles and Other charges. Certain costs included in
consolidated Cost of services and product development are not allocated to segment expense,
primarily web maintenance and customer relationship database costs, and certain bonus and fringe
charges. The accounting policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those used by the
Company.

We earn revenue from clients in many countries. Other than the United States, there is no
individual country in which revenues from external clients represent 10% or more of the Company’s
consolidated revenues. Additionally, no single client accounted for 10% or more of total revenue
and the loss of a single client, in management’s opinion, would not have a material adverse effect
on revenues.

We do not identify or allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment.
Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by
segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions in the allocation
of resources.

The following tables present information about the Company’s reportable segments (in thousands).
The “Other” column includes certain revenues and corporate and other expenses unallocated to
reportable segments, expenses allocated to operations that do not meet the segment reporting
quantitative threshold, and other charges. There are no intersegment revenues:

The Company’s consolidated revenues are generated primarily through direct sales to clients by
domestic and international sales forces and a network of independent international sales agents.
Revenues in the table below are reported based on where the sale is fulfilled; “Other
International” revenues are those attributable to all areas located outside of the United States
and Canada, as well as Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Most of our products and services are
provided on an integrated worldwide basis. Because of the integration of products and services
delivery, it is not practical to separate precisely our revenues by geographic location. Long-lived
assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets. Accordingly, the separation set forth in the
table below is based upon internal allocations, which involve certain management estimates and
judgments.
