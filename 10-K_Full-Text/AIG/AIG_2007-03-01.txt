American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

General Insurance Operations

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line
companies writing substantially all lines of commercial property
and casualty insurance and various personal lines both
domestically and abroad. Domestic General Insurance operations
are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG),
Reinsurance, Personal Lines, and Mortgage Guaranty.

AIG is diversified both in terms of classes of business and
geographic locations. In General Insurance, workers compensation
business is the largest class of business written and
represented approximately 15 percent of net premiums
written for the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2006,
8 percent and 7 percent of the direct General
Insurance premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums
and cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before
deducting reinsurance ceded) were written in California and New
York, respectively. No other state accounted for more than
five percent of such premiums.

The majority of AIG’s General Insurance business is in the
casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time
for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the
risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG’s loss reserve
development.

DBG

AIG’s primary Domestic General Insurance division is DBG.
DBG’s business in the United States and Canada is conducted
through American Home, National Union, Lexington, HSB and
certain other General Insurance company subsidiaries of AIG.
During 2006, DBG accounted for 54 percent of AIG’s
General Insurance net premiums written.

DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance,
accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This
provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and
retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to
submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company
contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no
authority to commit DBG to accept a risk.

In addition to writing substantially all classes of business
insurance, including large commercial or industrial property
insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental,
workers compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG
offers many specialized forms of insurance such as aviation,
accident and health, equipment breakdown, directors and officers
liability (D&O), difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom,
export credit and political risk, and various types of
professional errors and omissions coverages. The AIG Risk
Management operation provides insurance and risk management
programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance
operation is a leading provider of customized structured
insurance products. Also included in DBG are the operations of
AIG Environmental, which focuses specifically on providing
specialty products to clients with environmental exposures.
Lexington writes surplus lines for risks which conventional
insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage,
either because of complexity or because the coverage does not
lend itself to conventional contracts. The AIG Worldsource
Division introduces and coordinates AIG’s products and
services to

U.S.-based

multinational clients and foreign corporations doing business in
the U.S.

Certain of the products of the DBG companies include funding
components or have been structured so that little or no
insurance risk is actually transferred. Funds received in
connection with these products are recorded as deposits and
included in other liabilities, rather than premiums and incurred
losses.

Reinsurance

The subsidiaries of Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic)
offer reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis to
insurers in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures
programs for a full range of property and casualty products with
an emphasis on specialty risk. Transatlantic is a public company
owned 59.2 percent by AIG and therefore is included in
AIG’s consolidated financial statements.

Personal Lines

AIG’s Personal Lines operations provide automobile
insurance through AIG Direct, a mass marketing operation, the
Agency Auto Division and 21st Century Insurance Group (21st
Century), as well as a broad range of coverages for high
net-worth individuals through the AIG Private Client Group. 21st
Century is a public company owned 61.9 percent by AIG and
therefore is included in AIG’s consolidated financial
statements. During the first quarter of 2007, AIG offered to
acquire the outstanding shares of 21st Century not already owned
by AIG and its subsidiaries.

Mortgage Guaranty

The main business of the subsidiaries of United Guaranty
Corporation (UGC) is the issuance of residential mortgage
guaranty insurance, both domestically and internationally, on
conventional first lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance
of one to four family residences. UGC subsidiaries also
write second lien and private student loan guaranty insurance.

Foreign General Insurance

AIG’s Foreign General Insurance group accepts risks
primarily underwritten through American International
Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned
agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General Insurance
group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based
insurance subsidiaries. The Foreign General Insurance group uses
various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to
write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain
refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in
Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, including the U.K., Africa, the
Middle East and Latin America. During 2006, the Foreign General
Insurance group accounted for 25 percent of AIG’s
General Insurance net premiums written.

Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development

The reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the
accumulation of estimates for reported losses (case basis
reserves) and provisions for losses incurred but not reported

6       AIG

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

(IBNR), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable and
the discount for future investment income, where permitted.
Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred.

Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are
set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional
currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in
currency rates. See also Note 1(b) of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Management reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves
through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve
development techniques. Through the use of these techniques,
management is able to monitor the adequacy of AIG’s
established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for
inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development
patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and
IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required
adjustments.

The “Analysis of Consolidated Losses and Loss Expense
Reserve Development” table presents the development of net
losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1996 through
2006. Immediately following this table is a second table that
presents all data on a basis that excludes asbestos and
environmental net losses and loss expense reserve development.
The opening reserves held are shown at the top of the table for
each year end date. The amount of loss reserve discount included
in the opening reserve at each date is shown immediately below
the reserves held for each year. The undiscounted reserve at
each date is thus the sum of the discount and the reserve held.

The upper half of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid
during successive years related to the undiscounted opening loss
reserves. For example, in the table that excludes asbestos and
environmental losses, with respect to the net losses and loss
expense reserve of $24.75 billion as of December 31,
1999, by the end of 2006 (seven years later) $29.16 billion
had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the
original undiscounted reserve of $25.82 billion was
reestimated to be $36.28 billion at December 31, 2006.
This increase from the original estimate would generally result
from a combination of a number of factors, including reserves
being settled for larger amounts than originally estimated. The
original estimates will also be increased or decreased as more
information becomes known about the individual claims and
overall claim frequency and severity patterns. The redundancy
(deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar
year, presents the aggregate change in estimates over the period
of years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of
the respective column heading. For example, the redundancy of
$259 million at December 31, 2006 related to
December 31, 2005 net losses and loss expense reserves of
$57.34 billion represents the cumulative amount by which
reserves for 2005 and prior years have developed favorably
during 2006.

The bottom of each table below presents the remaining
undiscounted and discounted net loss reserve for each year. For
example, in the table that excludes asbestos and environmental
losses, for the 2001 year end, the remaining undiscounted
reserves held as of December 31, 2006 are
$12.25 billion, with a corresponding discounted net reserve
of $11.35 billion.

The reserves for net losses and loss expenses with respect to
Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in consolidated
net losses and loss expenses commencing with the year ended
December 31, 1998, the year they were first consolidated in
AIG’s financial statements. Reserve development for these
operations is included only for 1998 and subsequent periods.
Thus, the presentation for 1997 and prior year ends is not fully
comparable to that for 1998 and subsequent years in the tables
below.

AIG        9

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in
AIG’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006
differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements
filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate,
with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at
December 31, 2006 relate primarily to reserves for certain
foreign operations not required to be reported in the United
States for statutory reporting purposes. Further, statutory
practices in the United States require reserves to be shown net
of applicable reinsurance recoverable.

The reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to
reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses
and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross
loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss
reserves.

For further discussion regarding net reserves for losses and
loss expenses, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Operating Review — General Insurance
Operations — Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services Operations

AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries
offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products
both domestically and abroad. Insurance-oriented products
consist of individual and group life, payout annuities
(including structured settlements), endowment and accident and
health policies. Retirement savings products consist generally
of fixed and variable annuities.

There was no significant adverse effect on AIG’s Life
Insurance & Retirement Services results of operations
from economic conditions in any one state, country or geographic
region for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement
Services

In its Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses,
AIG operates overseas principally through ALICO, AIG Star Life,
AIG Edison Life, AIA, AIRCO, Nan Shan and Philamlife. ALICO is
incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written
outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either
directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, including the U.K.,
Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, South Asia and
the Far East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIA
operates primarily in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam,
Indonesia, and India. The operations in India are conducted
through a joint venture, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company
Limited. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. Philamlife is the largest
life insurer in the Philippines. AIG Star Life and AIG Edison
Life operate in Japan. Operations in foreign countries comprised
78 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP
premiums and 68 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operating income in 2006.

The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services
companies have over 270,000 full and part-time agents, as well
as independent producers, and sell their products largely to
indigenous persons in local and foreign currencies. In addition
to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their
products through direct marketing channels, such as mass
marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets,
such as financial institutions.

Life insurance products such as whole life and endowment
continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially
in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of life insurance, accident
and health and retirement services products are sold in Japan.

AIG also has subsidiary operations in Canada, Egypt, Mexico,
Poland, Switzerland, Russia and Puerto Rico, and conducts life
insurance business through a joint venture in Brazil and in
certain countries in Central and South America.

Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services

AIG’s principal domestic Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations include AGLA, AIG American
General, AIG Annuity, USLIFE, VALIC and SunAmerica Life. These
companies utilize multiple distribution channels including
independent producers, brokerage, career agents and banks to
offer life insurance, annuity and accident and health products
and services, as well as financial and other investment
products. The domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations comprised 22 percent of total Life
Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums and
32 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services
operating income in 2006.

Reinsurance

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries worldwide operate
primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct
account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the risk in
excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This operating
policy differs from that of many insurance companies that will
underwrite only up to their net retention limit, thereby
requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from other
underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount.

Various AIG profit centers, including DBG, AIU, AIG Reinsurance
Advisors, Inc. and AIG Risk Finance, as well as certain Foreign
Life subsidiaries, use AIRCO as a reinsurer for certain of their
businesses, and AIRCO also receives premiums from offshore
captives of AIG clients. In accordance with permitted accounting
practices in Bermuda, AIRCO discounts reserves attributable to
certain classes of business assumed from other AIG subsidiaries.

For a further discussion of reinsurance, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors — Reinsurance, Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risk Management — Reinsurance
and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance Investment
Operations

A significant portion of AIG’s General Insurance and Life
Insurance & Retirement Services revenues are derived
from AIG’s

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

insurance investment operations, which are summarized in the
following table.

The following table summarizes the
investment results of the insurance operations.

AIG’s worldwide insurance investment policy places primary
emphasis on investments in government and other high quality,
fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a
lesser extent, investments in high yield bonds, common stocks,
real estate, hedge funds and partnerships, in order to enhance
returns on policyholders’ funds and generate net investment
income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited
in certain territories as there may be a lack of adequate
long-term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed
by the local regulatory authorities.

Financial Services Operations

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified
activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance.
Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer
Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues
produced by the Financial Services operations. Imperial A.I.
Credit Companies also contribute to Financial Services income.
This operation engages principally in insurance premium
financing for both AIG’s customers and those of other
insurers.

Aircraft Leasing

AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations
of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new
and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic
airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of
commercial jets for its own account, and remarketing and fleet
management services for airlines and for financial institutions.
See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Capital Markets

The Capital Markets operations of AIG are conducted primarily
through AIGFP, which engages as principal in standard and
customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy
and credit products with top-tier corporations, financial
institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors,
and high-net-worth individuals throughout the world. AIGFP also
invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal
investments and engages in borrowing activities that include
issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and
entering into guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs). See also
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumer Finance

Consumer Finance operations include AGF as well as AIGCFG. AGF
provides a wide variety of consumer finance products, including
real estate and non-real estate loans, retail sales finance and
credit-related insurance to customers in the United States,
Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AIGCFG, through its
subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi-product consumer
finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets.

Asset Management Operations

AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety
of investment-related services and investment products,
including institutional and retail asset management,
broker-dealer services and institutional spread-based investment
business. Such services and products are offered to individuals
and institutions both domestically and overseas. Asset
Management’s spread-based

AIG        11

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

investment business includes the results of AIG’s
proprietary institutional spread-based investment operation, the
Matched Investment Program (MIP), which was launched in
September of 2005 and replaced the GIC program.

AIG’s principal Asset Management operations are conducted
through certain subsidiaries of AIG Retirement Services, Inc.,
including SAAMCo and the AIG Advisor Group broker dealers (AIG
SunAmerica); and through AIGGIG, including AIG Global Investment
Corp., AIG Global Real Estate and AIG Private Bank. AIG
SunAmerica sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial
advisory services through independent-contractor registered
representatives. AIGGIG manages invested assets on a global
basis for AIG subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as
third-party institutional, retail, and private banking clients.
AIGGIG offers equity, fixed income and alternative investment
funds and provides securities lending and custodial services and
numerous forms of structured investment products across all
asset classes. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees
for investment products and services provided.

Other Operations

Certain other AIG subsidiaries provide insurance-related
services such as adjusting claims and marketing specialized
products. Several wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of AIG
operating in countries or jurisdictions such as Ireland,
Bermuda, Barbados and Gibraltar provide insurance and related
administrative and back office services to a variety of
affiliated and unaffiliated insurance and reinsurance companies,
including captive insurance companies unaffiliated with AIG.

AIG also has several other subsidiaries which engage in various
businesses. Mt. Mansfield Company, Inc. owns and operates the
ski slopes, lifts, school and an inn located at Stowe, Vermont.
Also included in AIG’s Other operations are unallocated
corporate expenses, including interest expense and the
settlement costs more fully described in Item 3. Legal
Proceedings and Note 12(a) of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Additional Investments

AIG’s significant investments in partially owned companies
(which are accounted for under the equity method) include a
19.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings,
Ltd. (AWAC), a property-casualty insurance holding company, a
24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance
Co., Ltd., a general insurance company, a 26 percent
interest in Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and a
26 percent interest in Tata AIG General Insurance Company,
Ltd. For a discussion of AIG’s investments in partially
owned companies, see Note 1(u) of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Locations of Certain Assets

As of December 31, 2006, approximately 37 percent of
the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries
(other than Canada), including $6.5 billion of cash and
securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities.
Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely
affected by political developments in foreign countries,
including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization,
and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of
hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their
overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot
easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does
occur, AIG’s policy is to take all appropriate measures to
seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which
AIG’s business is conducted have currency restrictions
which generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to
repatriate assets and profits. See also Notes 1 and 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Foreign Operations.

Regulation

AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation
by many different types of regulatory authorities, including
insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift
regulators in the United States and abroad. The regulatory
environment can have a significant effect on AIG and its
business. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and
consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory
supervision and the possibility of intervention. In addition,
the investigations into financial accounting practices that led
to two restatements of AIG’s consolidated financial
statements have heightened regulatory scrutiny of AIG worldwide.

In 1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company within the
meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA) when the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to
organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. AIG is subject to OTS
regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements.
In addition, the OTS has enforcement authority over AIG and its
subsidiaries. Among other things, this permits the OTS to
restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a
serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of
AIG’s subsidiary savings association, AIG Federal Savings
Bank.

Under prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding company,
such as AIG, was not restricted as to the types of business in
which it could engage, provided that its savings association
subsidiary continued to be a qualified thrift lender. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) provides that no
company may acquire control of an OTS regulated institution
after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial
activities permitted for financial holding companies under the
law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The
GLBA, however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for
activities with respect to a unitary savings and loan holding
company existing prior to May 4, 1999, so long as its
savings association subsidiary continues to be a qualified
thrift lender under the HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan
holding company whose application was pending as of May 4,
1999, AIG is grandfathered under the GLBA and generally is not
restricted under existing laws as to the types of business
activities in which it may engage, provided that AIG Federal
Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the
HOLA.

Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by
insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are
controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation
typically

12       AIG


Form

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that
controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the
holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate
services and transfers of assets (including in some instances
payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the
holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are registered
under such legislation in those states that have such
requirements.

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other
insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the
states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business.
Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies
but generally has its source in statutes that delegate
regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The
regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of
policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be
met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements,
the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and
limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks
that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of
securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for
acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the
affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports
of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for
unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such
regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than
the equity owners of these companies.

In preparing both its 2004 and 2005 audited statutory financial
statements for its Domestic General Insurance companies, AIG
agreed with the relevant regulatory agencies on the statutory
accounting treatment of the various items requiring adjustment
or restatement. These adjustments and restatements reduced
previously reported General Insurance statutory surplus at
December 31, 2004 by approximately $3.5 billion to
approximately $20.6 billion.

With respect to the 2005 audited statutory financial statements,
the state regulators permitted the Domestic General Insurance
companies to record a $724 million reduction to opening
statutory surplus as of January 1, 2005.

AIG has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of
the Domestic General Insurance companies. AIG entered into
capital maintenance agreements with the Domestic General
Insurance companies that set forth procedures through which AIG
will provide ongoing capital support. Dividends from the
Domestic General Insurance companies were suspended from fourth
quarter 2005 through 2006, but AIG expects that dividend
payments will resume in the first quarter of 2007. AIG
contributed an additional $750 million of capital into
American Home effective September 30, 2005, and contributed
a further $2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a
total of approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic
General Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005.
Furthermore, in order to allow the Domestic General Insurance
companies to record as an admitted asset at December 31,
2006 certain reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers (which has
the effect of increasing the statutory surplus of such Domestic
General Insurance companies), AIG obtained and entered into
reimbursement agreements for approximately $2 billion of
letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of
certain Domestic General Insurance companies.

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of
an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks
inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general
and life insurance companies may be identified.

The RBC formula develops a risk-adjusted target level of
statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset,
premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more
risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items.
Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a
result of the insurer’s size, but also based on the risk
profile of the insurer’s operations.

The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of
regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the
calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in
severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for
corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory
control.

The statutory surplus of each of AIG’s Domestic General and
Life Insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC target levels as
of December 31, 2006.

To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would
fall below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be
AIG’s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that
entity.

A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business
and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in
foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in
foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the
underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must
satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by
foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to
modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other
AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in
certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In
the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to
conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions.

In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign
operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with
respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type
of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and
type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned
to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign
countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain
countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or
partially owned by the local government, to which admitted
insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on
terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG
subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations
governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance
balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of
assets.

Competition

AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management
businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both
domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are
insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank
financial institutions.

The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive.
Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance
subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,100 other stock
companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies
and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries
offering Life Insurance & Retirement Services compete
in the United States with approximately 2,000 life insurance
companies and other participants in related financial services
fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with
foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers,
global insurance groups, and local companies in particular areas
in which they are active.

AIG’s strong ratings have historically provided a
competitive advantage. For a discussion of the possible adverse
effects on AIG’s competitive position as a result of a
ratings downgrade, see Item 1A. Risk
Factors — AIG’s Credit Ratings.

Directors and Executive Officers of
AIG

Set forth below is information concerning the directors and
executive officers of AIG. All directors are elected for
one-year terms at the annual meeting of shareholders. All
executive officers are elected to one-year terms, but serve at
the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

Except as hereinafter noted, each of the executive officers has,
for more than five years, occupied an executive position with
AIG or companies that are now its subsidiaries. Other than the
employment contracts between AIG and Messrs. Sullivan and
Bensinger, there are no other arrangements or understandings
between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to
which the executive officer was elected to such position. From
January 2000 until joining AIG in May 2004, Dr. Frenkel
served as Chairman of Merrill Lynch International, Inc. Prior to
joining AIG in September 2002, Mr. Bensinger was Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Combined Specialty
Group, Inc. (a division of Aon Corporation) commencing in March
2002, and served as Executive Vice President of Trenwick Group,
Ltd. from October 1999 through December 2001. Prior to joining
AIG in September 2006, Ms. Kelly served as Executive Vice
President and General Counsel of MCI/WorldCom. Previously, she
was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Sears, Roebuck
and Co. from 1999 to 2003.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Casualty Insurance Underwriting and
Reserves

Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and
may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss
expenses.

Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of the
established reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can be
no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not
develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s current loss
reserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and
loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines
of business, which include excess and umbrella liability,
D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers
compensation, general liability, products liability and related
classes, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures.
Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used
to project future loss development. However, there can be no
assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same
as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or
in loss development factors might not be discernible for an
extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the
initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus,
there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of
years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost
trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in
setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss
development factors could be attributable to changes in
inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or
economic phenomena affecting claims. See also Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Operating Review — General
Insurance Operations — Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses.

Adjustments to Life Insurance &
Retirement Services Deferred Policy

Acquisition Costs

Interest rate fluctuations and other events may require AIG
subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs (DAC) which could adversely affect AIG’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

DAC represents the costs that vary with and are related
primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and
annuity contracts. When interest rates rise, policy loans and
surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and
annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy
products with perceived higher returns, requiring AIG
subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC. To the
extent such amortization exceeds surrender or other charges
earned upon surrender and withdrawals of certain life insurance
policies and annuity contracts, AIG’s results of operations
could be negatively affected.

DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products
as well as retirement services products is reviewed for
recoverability, which involves estimating the future
profitability of current business. This review involves
significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of
future profitability were to be substantially lower than
estimated, AIG could be required to accelerate its DAC
amortization and such acceleration could adversely affect
AIG’s results of operations. See also Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and
Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reinsurance

Reinsurance may not be available or affordable.

AIG
subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and utilize
reinsurance as part of AIG’s overall risk management
strategy. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to
manage transaction and insurance line risk retention, and to
mitigate losses that may arise from catastrophes. Market
conditions beyond AIG’s control determine the availability
and cost of the reinsurance purchased by AIG subsidiaries. For
example, reinsurance may be more difficult to obtain after a
year with a large number of major catastrophes. Accordingly, AIG
may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or
may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable
terms, in which case AIG would have to accept an increase in
exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by its
subsidiaries or seek alternatives.

Reinsurance subjects AIG to the credit risk of its reinsurers
and may not be adequate to protect AIG against losses.

Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to the AIG
subsidiary to the extent the risk is ceded, it does not relieve
the AIG subsidiary of the primary liability to its
policyholders. Accordingly, AIG bears credit risk with respect
to its subsidiaries’ reinsurers. A reinsurer’s
insolvency or inability or refusal to make timely payments under
the terms of its agreements with the AIG subsidiaries could have
a material adverse effect on AIG’s results of operations
and liquidity. See also Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Risk Management — Reinsurance.

A Material Weakness

The remaining material weakness in AIG’s internal
control over financial reporting relating to income tax
accounting could affect the accuracy or timing of future
regulatory filings.

As of December 31, 2006, AIG’s
management concluded that the material weakness relating to the
controls over income tax accounting was not fully remediated.
Remediation of this material weakness is ongoing. Until
remediated, this weakness could affect the accuracy or timing of
future filings with the SEC and other regulatory authorities.
See also Item 9A. Controls and Procedures —
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Catastrophe Exposures

The occurrence of catastrophic events could adversely affect
AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

The occurrence of events such as hurricanes,
earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and other
catastrophes could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated
financial condition or results of

Form

10-K


AIG        15

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

operations, including by exposing AIG’s businesses to the
following:

•

widespread claim costs associated with property, workers
    compensation, mortality and morbidity claims;

•

loss resulting from the cash flows from invested assets being
    less than the cash flows required to meet the policy and
    contract liabilities; or

•

loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely
    emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product
    pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and
    expenses.

Legal Proceedings

Significant legal proceedings adversely affected AIG’s
results of operations in 2005.

As a result of the
settlements discussed below under Item 3. Legal
Proceedings, AIG recorded an after-tax charge of approximately
$1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG is party
to numerous other legal proceedings and regulatory
investigations. It is possible that the effect of the unresolved
matters could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for an individual reporting period. For a discussion
of these unresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Regulation

AIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions
in which it conducts its businesses.

AIG’s operations
around the world are subject to regulation by different types of
regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities,
investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United
States and abroad. AIG’s operations have become more
diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of
regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In
particular, AIG’s consumer lending business is subject to a
broad array of laws and regulations governing lending practices
and permissible loan terms, and AIG would expect increased
regulatory oversight relating to this business.

The regulatory environment could have a significant effect on
AIG and its businesses. Among other things, AIG could be fined,
prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities or
subject to limitations or conditions on its business activities.
Significant regulatory action against AIG could have material
adverse financial effects, cause significant reputational harm,
or harm business prospects. New laws or regulations or changes
in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to
clients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses.

Foreign Operations

Foreign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect its
operations, liquidity and financial condition.

AIG provides
insurance and investment products and services to both
businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and
jurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIG’s General
Insurance business and a majority of its Life
Insurance & Retirement Services businesses are
conducted outside the United States. Operations outside of the
United States may be affected by regional economic downturns,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval,
nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which
could also affect other AIG operations.

The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign
jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the
underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must
satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by
foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to
modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance
subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business
in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.
AIG’s international operations include operations in
various developing nations. Both current and future foreign
operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political
developments including tax changes, regulatory restrictions and
nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation.
Adverse actions from any one country may adversely affect
AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s
net financial exposure at that time in that country.

Information Technology

A failure in AIG’s operational systems or infrastructure
or those of third parties could disrupt business, damage
AIG’s reputation and cause losses.

AIG’s
operations rely on the secure processing, storage and
transmission of confidential and other information in its
computer systems and networks. AIG’s business depends on
effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness
of the data it uses to run its business. AIG’s ability to
adequately price its products and services, establish reserves,
provide effective and efficient service to its customers, and to
timely and accurately report its financial results also depends
significantly on the integrity of the data in its information
systems. Although AIG takes protective measures and endeavors to
modify them as circumstances warrant, its computer systems,
software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access,
computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that
could have security consequences. If one or more of such events
occur, this potentially could jeopardize AIG’s or its
clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other
information processed and stored in, and transmitted through,
its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause
interruptions or malfunctions in AIG’s, its clients’,
its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations,
which could result in significant losses or reputational damage.
AIG may be required to expend significant additional resources
to modify its protective measures or to investigate and
remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and AIG may be
subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not
insured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained.

Despite the contingency plans and facilities AIG has in place,
its ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a
disruption of the infrastructure that supports AIG’s
business in the communities in which it is located. This may
include a disruption involving electrical, communications,
transportation or other services used by AIG. These disruptions
may occur, for example, as a result of events that affect only
the buildings occupied by AIG or as a result of events

16       AIG


Form

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

with a broader effect on the cities where those buildings are
located. If a disruption occurs in one location and AIG’s
employees in that location are unable to occupy its offices and
conduct business or communicate with or travel to other
locations, AIG’s ability to service and interact with its
clients may suffer and it may not be able to successfully
implement contingency plans that depend on communication or
travel.

AIG’s Credit Ratings

Financial strength and credit ratings by major ratings
agencies are an important factor in establishing the competitive
position of insurance companies and other financial institutions
and affect the availability and cost of borrowings.

Any
ratings downgrade may lessen AIG’s ability to compete in
certain businesses and may increase AIG’s interest expense.
Financial strength ratings measure an insurance company’s
ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and
policyholders, help to maintain public confidence in a
company’s products, facilitate marketing of products and
enhance a company’s competitive position. Credit ratings
measure a company’s ability to repay its obligations and
directly affect the cost and availability to that company of
unsecured financing. Historically, AIG’s credit and
financial strength ratings have provided AIG a competitive
advantage.

From March through June of 2005, the major rating agencies
downgraded the ratings of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries in
a series of actions. Many of the ratings were put on negative
watch or negative outlook, which indicates a potential
downgrade. Since then, however, the agencies have affirmed the
ratings of AIG and all of its subsidiaries with a stable
outlook, which indicates that the rating is not likely to change
in the near term, except that S&P maintains a negative
outlook on Transatlantic and on the senior long-term debt rating
of ILFC.

A downgrade of the credit or financial strength ratings of AIG
or its subsidiaries could adversely affect AIG’s business
and its consolidated results of operations in a number of ways,
including:

•

increasing AIG’s interest expense;

•

reducing AIGFP’s ability to compete in the structured
    products and derivatives businesses;

•

reducing the competitive advantage of AIG’s insurance
    subsidiaries, which may result in reduced product sales and/or
    lower prices;

•

adversely affecting relationships with agents and sales
    representatives; and

•

in the case of a downgrade of AGF or ILFC, increasing their
    interest expense and reducing their ability to compete in their
    respective businesses.

As a result of the downgrades in 2005 discussed above, AIG was
required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral
with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts
and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a
further downgrade, AIG would be required to post additional
collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on
February 15, 2007, based on AIG’s outstanding
municipal GIAs and financial derivatives transactions as of such
date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt
ratings to Aa3 by Moody’s or AA- by S&P would permit
counterparties to call for approximately $864 million of
additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could
result in requirements for substantial additional collateral,
which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its
liquidity. For a further discussion of AIG’s credit ratings
and the potential effect of posting collateral on AIG’s
liquidity, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Capital Resources and Liquidity — Credit Ratings
and — Liquidity.

Liquidity

Liquidity risk represents the potential inability of AIG to
meet all payment obligations when they become due.

AIG’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access
the capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflows of
cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may
be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an
operational problem that affects third parties or AIG. AIG
depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its
subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund payments on
AIG’s obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory
and other legal restrictions may limit AIG’s ability to
transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries. In
particular, many of AIG’s subsidiaries, including
AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws and
regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce
the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that
prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances.
These laws and regulations may hinder AIG’s ability to
access funds that AIG may need to make payments on its
obligations. See also Item 1. Business —
Regulation.

Some of AIG’s investments are relatively illiquid.

AIG’s investments in certain fixed income investments,
certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited
partnerships, hedge funds and real estate are relatively
illiquid. These asset classes represented nine percent of
the carrying value of AIG’s total cash and invested assets
as of December 31, 2006. If AIG requires significant
amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash
requirements, AIG may have difficulty selling these investments
in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for less than what
AIG might otherwise have been able to, or both.

Concentration of AIG’s investment portfolios in any
particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects.

The concentration of AIG’s investment portfolios in any
particular industry, group of related industries or geographic
sector could have an adverse effect on the investment portfolios
and consequently on AIG’s results of operations and
financial position. While AIG seeks to mitigate this risk by
having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments
that have a negative effect on any particular industry, group of
related industries or geographic region may have a greater
adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that
the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified.
Further, AIG’s ability to sell assets relating to such
particular industry, group of related industries or geographic
region may be limited if other market participants are seeking
to sell at the same time.

The Relationships Between AIG and

the Starr Entities

The relationships between AIG and the Starr entities may take
an extended period of time to unwind and/or resolve, and the
consequences of such resolution are uncertain.

During 2006,
AIG unwound and resolved its most significant relationships with
C.V. Starr & Co, Inc. (Starr) and began unwinding and
resolving various relationships with Starr International
Company, Inc. (SICO). AIG cannot predict what its future
relationship with Starr and SICO will be.

The agency relationships between AIG subsidiaries and Starr have
been terminated and litigation with Starr has been resolved, but
there can be no assurance that AIG will compete successfully for
the business previously produced by the Starr agencies. In
January 2006, Starr announced that it had completed its tender
offers to purchase interests in Starr and that all eligible
shareholders had tendered their shares. As a result of
completion of the tender offers, no AIG executive currently
holds any Starr interest.

AIG has entered into agreements pursuant to which AIG agrees,
subject to certain conditions, to assure AIG’s current
employees that all payments are made under a series of two-year
Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans provided by
SICO (SICO Plans). For a further discussion of the SICO plans,
see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that AIG will be able to
effectively address the consequences for its executives of the
unwinding of their participation in the SICO plans and programs.
Finally, litigation between AIG and SICO remains pending, and
the timing, terms and effect on AIG of any resolution cannot
currently be predicted. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Employee Error and Misconduct

Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and
prevent and may result in significant losses.

Losses may
result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to
document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal
authorization or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.

There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving
fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services
industry in recent years, and AIG runs the risk that employee
misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or
prevent employee misconduct and the precautions AIG takes to
prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all
cases.

Aircraft Suppliers

There are limited suppliers of aircraft and engines.

The
supply of jet transport aircraft, which ILFC purchases and
leases, is dominated by two airframe manufacturers, Boeing and
Airbus, and a limited number of engine manufacturers. As a
result, ILFC is dependent on the manufacturers’ success in
remaining financially stable, producing aircraft and related
components which meet the airlines’ demands, both in type
and quantity, and fulfilling their contractual obligations to
ILFC. Competition between the manufacturers for market share is
intense and may lead to instances of deep discounting for
certain aircraft types and may negatively affect ILFC’s
competitive pricing.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

There are no material unresolved written comments that were
received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end
of AIG’s fiscal year relating to AIG’s periodic or
current reports under the Exchange Act.

Item 2.

Properties

AIG and its subsidiaries operate from approximately 2,300
offices in the United States, 6 offices in Canada and numerous
offices in approximately 100 foreign countries. The offices in
Greensboro and Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Springfield,
Illinois; Amarillo, Ft. Worth and Houston, Texas;
Wilmington, Delaware; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Tampa, Florida;
Livingston, New Jersey; Evansville, Indiana; Nashville,

Singapore, Malaysia, Switzerland, Taiwan and Thailand are
located in buildings owned by AIG and its subsidiaries. The
remainder of the office space utilized by AIG subsidiaries is
leased.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

General

AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry
in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for
punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. See

Statements, as well as the discussion and analysis of
Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development and

and Results of Operations herein.

2006 Regulatory Settlements

In February 2006, AIG reached a final settlement with the SEC,
the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of the
New York Attorney General (NYAG) and the New York State
Department of Insurance (DOI). The settlements resolved
investigations conducted by the SEC, NYAG and DOI in connection
with the accounting, financial reporting and insurance brokerage
practices of AIG and its subsidiaries, as well as claims
relating to the underpayment of certain workers compensation
premium taxes and other assessments. The 2005 financial
statements included in this Annual Report on
Form

include
a fourth quarter after-tax charge of $1.15 billion relating
to the settlements.

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

As part of the settlement with the SEC, the SEC filed a civil
complaint, alleging that from 2000 until 2005, AIG materially
falsified its financial statements through a variety of
transactions and entities in order to strengthen the appearance
of its financial results to analysts and investors. AIG, without
admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint,
consented to the issuance of a final judgment on
February 9, 2006: (a) permanently restraining and
enjoining AIG from violating Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b),
13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) and
Rules

10b-5,

12b-20,

13a-1,

and 13b2-1 of
the Exchange Act; (b) ordering AIG to pay disgorgement in
the amount of $700 million; and (c) ordering AIG to
pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100 million. The
$800 million was deposited into a fund under the
supervision of the SEC to be available to resolve claims
asserted against AIG by investors, including the shareholder
lawsuits described below.

In February 2006, AIG and the DOJ entered into a letter
agreement whereby AIG agreed to cooperate with the DOJ in the
DOJ’s ongoing criminal investigation of violations of
federal criminal law in connection with misstatements in
periodic financial reports that AIG filed with the SEC between
2000 and 2004 relating to certain transactions, accepted
responsibility for certain of its actions and those of its
employees relating to these transactions, and paid
$25 million in penalties.

In February 2006, AIG entered into agreements with the NYAG and
the DOI, resolving claims under New York’s Martin Act and
insurance laws. Under the agreements, $375 million was paid
into a fund under the supervision of the NYAG and the DOI to be
available principally to pay certain insureds who purchased AIG
excess casualty policies through Marsh & McLennan
Companies, Inc. or Marsh Inc. (Marsh). In addition, a fund of
approximately $343 million was created to pay obligations
resulting from the underpayment by AIG of its workers
compensation premium taxes and related fees and assessments. In
addition, AIG paid a $100 million fine to the State of New
York.

As part of these settlements, AIG has agreed to retain, for a
period of three years, an independent consultant who will
conduct a review that will include, among other things, the
adequacy of AIG’s internal controls over financial
reporting, the policies, procedures and effectiveness of
AIG’s regulatory, compliance and legal functions, and the
remediation plan that AIG has implemented as a result of its own
internal review.

PNC Settlement

In November 2004, AIG and AIGFP reached a final settlement with
the SEC, the Fraud Section of the DOJ and the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana with respect to
issues arising from certain structured transactions entered into
with Brightpoint, Inc. and The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc. (PNC), the marketing of transactions similar to the PNC
transactions and related matters.

As part of the settlement, the SEC filed against AIG a civil
complaint, based on the conduct of AIG primarily through AIGFP,
alleging violations of certain antifraud provisions of the
federal securities laws and aiding and abetting violations of
reporting and record keeping provisions of those laws. AIG,
without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC
complaint, consented to the issuance of a final judgment
permanently enjoining it and its employees and related persons
from violating certain provisions of the Exchange Act, Exchange
Act rules and the Securities Act, ordering disgorgement of fees
it received in the PNC transactions and providing for AIG to
establish a transaction review committee to review the
appropriateness of certain future transactions and to retain an
independent consultant to examine certain transactions entered
into between 2000 and 2004 and review the policies and
procedures of the transaction review committee. AIG expects that
the review by the independent consultant of transactions entered
into by AIG during the 2000 to 2004 period will be completed
during 2007.

The settlement with the DOJ consists of separate agreements with
AIG and AIGFP and a criminal complaint alleging violations of
federal securities laws filed against, and deferred prosecution
agreement with, a wholly owned subsidiary of AIGFP. Under the
terms of the settlement, AIGFP paid a penalty of
$80 million. On January 17, 2006, the court approved
an order dismissing the complaint with prejudice.

Regulatory Investigations

Regulators from several states have commenced investigations
into insurance brokerage practices related to contingent
commissions and other industry-wide practices as well as other
broker-related conduct, such as alleged bid rigging.

In addition, various federal and state regulatory agencies are
reviewing certain other transactions and practices of AIG and
its subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other
inquiries. AIG has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate,
with all these investigations, including by producing documents
and other information in response to subpoenas.

Pending Private Litigation

Securities Actions.

Beginning in October 2004, a number
of putative securities fraud class action suits were filed
against AIG and consolidated as

In re American International
Group, Inc. Securities Litigation.

Subsequently, a separate,
though similar, securities fraud action was also brought against
AIG by certain Florida pension funds. The lead plaintiff in the
class action is a group of public retirement systems and pension
funds benefiting Ohio state employees, suing on behalf of
themselves and all purchasers of AIG’s publicly traded
securities between October 28, 1999 and April 1, 2005.
The named defendants are AIG and a number of present and former
AIG officers and directors, as well as Starr, SICO, General
Reinsurance Corporation and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC),
among others. The lead plaintiff alleges, among other things,
that AIG: (1) concealed that it engaged in anti-competitive
conduct through alleged payment of contingent commissions to
brokers and participation in illegal bid-rigging;
(2) concealed that it used “income smoothing”
products and other techniques to inflate its earnings;
(3) concealed that it marketed and sold “income
smoothing” insurance products to other companies; and
(4) misled investors about the scope of

AIG        19

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

government investigations. In addition, the lead plaintiff
alleges that AIG’s former Chief Executive Officer
manipulated AIG’s stock price. The lead plaintiff asserts
claims for violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and
Rule

10b-5

promulgated thereunder, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
and Section 20A of the Exchange Act. In April 2006, the
court denied the defendants’ motions to dismiss the second
amended class action complaint and the Florida complaint. In
December 2006, a third amended class action complaint was filed,
which does not differ substantially from the prior complaint.
Fact and class discovery is currently ongoing.

ERISA Action.

Between November 30, 2004 and
July 1, 2005, several Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA) actions were filed on behalf of a purported
class of participants and beneficiaries of three pension plans
sponsored by AIG or its subsidiaries. A consolidated complaint
filed on September 26, 2005 alleges a class period between
September 30, 2000 and May 31, 2005 and names as
defendants AIG, the members of AIG’s Retirement Board and
the Administrative Boards of the plans at issue, and four
present or former members of AIG’s Board of Directors. The
factual allegations in the complaint are essentially identical
to those in the securities actions described above. Plaintiffs
allege that defendants violated duties under ERISA by allowing
the plans to offer AIG stock as a permitted investment, when
defendants allegedly knew it was not a prudent investment, and
by failing to provide participants with accurate information
about AIG stock. AIG’s motion to dismiss was denied on
December 12, 2006. Discovery will be consolidated with
proceedings in the securities actions.

Derivative Actions — Southern District of New
York.

Between October 25, 2004 and July 14, 2005, seven
separate derivative actions were filed in the Southern District
of New York, five of which were consolidated into a single
action. The New York derivative complaint contains nearly the
same types of allegations made in the securities fraud and ERISA
actions described above. The named defendants include current
and former officers and directors of AIG, as well as Marsh,
SICO, Starr, ACE Limited and subsidiaries (ACE), General
Reinsurance Corporation, PwC, and certain employees or officers
of these entity defendants. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach
of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate
assets, unjust enrichment, insider selling, auditor breach of
contract, auditor professional negligence and disgorgement from
AIG’s former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of incentive-based compensation and AIG share proceeds
under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among others.
Plaintiffs seek, among other things, compensatory damages,
corporate governance reforms, and a voiding of the election of
certain AIG directors. AIG’s Board of Directors has
appointed a special committee of independent directors (special
committee) to review the matters asserted in the operative
consolidated derivative complaint. The court has approved
agreements staying the derivative case pending in the Southern
District of New York while the special committee performs its
work. The current stay extends until March 14, 2007.

Derivative Actions — Delaware Chancery Court.

From October 2004 to April 2005, AIG shareholders filed five
derivative complaints in the Delaware Chancery Court. All of
these derivative lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action. The amended consolidated complaint names 43 defendants
(not including nominal defendant AIG) who, like the New York
consolidated derivative litigation, are current and former
officers and directors of AIG, as well as other entities and
certain of their current and former employees and directors. The
factual allegations, legal claims and relief sought in the
Delaware action are similar to those alleged in the New York
derivative actions, except that plaintiffs in the Delaware
derivative action assert claims only under state law. The court
has approved agreements staying the derivative case pending in
the Delaware Chancery Court while the special committee performs
its work. The current stay extends until March 14, 2007.

An additional derivative lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Chancery
Court in December 2002 against twenty directors and executives
of AIG as well as against AIG as a nominal defendant, alleges,
among other things, that the directors of AIG breached the
fiduciary duties of loyalty and care by approving the payment of
commissions to Starr and of rental and service fees to SICO and
the executives breached their duty of loyalty by causing AIG to
enter into contracts with Starr and SICO and their fiduciary
duties by usurping AIG’s corporate opportunity. The
complaint further alleges that the Starr agencies did not
provide any services that AIG was not capable of providing
itself, and that the diversion of commissions to these entities
was solely for the benefit of Starr’s owners. The complaint
also alleged that the service fees and rental payments made to
SICO and its subsidiaries were improper. Under the terms of a
stipulation approved by the Court on February 16, 2006, the
claims against the outside independent directors were dismissed
with prejudice, while the claims against the other directors
were dismissed without prejudice. On October 31, 2005,
Messrs. Greenberg, Matthews and Smith, SICO and Starr filed
motions to dismiss the amended complaint. In an opinion dated
June 21, 2006, the Court denied defendants’ motion to
dismiss, except with respect to plaintiff’s challenge to
payments made to Starr before January 1, 2000. On
July 21, 2006, plaintiff filed its second amended
complaint, which alleges that, between January 1, 2000 and
May 31, 2005, individual defendants breached their duty of
loyalty by causing AIG to enter into contracts with Starr and
SICO and breached their fiduciary duties by usurping AIG’s
corporate opportunity. Starr is charged with aiding and abetting
breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment for its
acceptance of the fees. SICO is no longer named as a defendant.
Discovery is currently ongoing.

Policyholder Actions.

After the NYAG filed its complaint
against insurance broker Marsh, policyholders brought multiple
federal antitrust and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) class actions in jurisdictions across
the nation against insurers and brokers, including AIG and a
number of its subsidiaries, alleging that the insurers and
brokers engaged in a broad conspiracy to allocate customers,
steer business, and rig bids. These actions, including 18
complaints filed in different federal courts naming AIG or an
AIG subsidiary as a defendant, were

20       AIG

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

consolidated by the judicial panel on multi-district litigation
and transferred to the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey for coordinated pretrial proceedings. The
consolidated actions have proceeded in that court in two
parallel actions,

In re Insurance Brokerage Antitrust
Litigation

(the

Commercial Complaint

) and

In re
Employee Benefit Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation

(the

Employee Benefits Complaint

, and together with
the

Commercial Complaint

, the multi-district litigation).

The plaintiffs in the

Commercial Complaint

are nineteen
corporations, individuals and public entities that contracted
with the broker defendants for the provision of insurance
brokerage services for a variety of insurance needs. The broker
defendants are alleged to have placed insurance coverage on the
plaintiffs’ behalf with a number of insurance companies
named as defendants, including AIG subsidiaries. The

Commercial Complaint

also named ten brokers and fourteen
other insurers (one of which has since settled) as defendants.
The

Commercial Complaint

alleges that defendants engaged
in a widespread conspiracy to allocate customers through
“bid-rigging” and “steering” practices. The

Commercial Complaint

also alleges that the insurer
defendants permitted brokers to place business with AIG
subsidiaries through wholesale intermediaries affiliated with or
owned by those same brokers rather than placing the business
with AIG subsidiaries directly. Finally, the

Commercial
Complaint

alleges that the insurer defendants entered into
agreements with broker defendants that tied insurance placements
to reinsurance placements in order to provide additional
compensation to each broker. Plaintiffs assert that the
defendants violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, RICO, the
antitrust laws of 48 states and the District of Columbia,
and are liable under common law breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment theories. Plaintiffs seek treble damages plus
interest and attorneys’ fees as a result of the alleged
RICO and Sherman Act violations.

The plaintiffs in the

Employee Benefits Complaint

are
nine individual employees and corporate and municipal employers
alleging claims on behalf of two separate nationwide purported
classes: an employee class and an employer class that acquired
insurance products from the defendants from August 26, 1994
to the date of any class certification. The

Employee Benefits
Complaint

names AIG, as well as eleven brokers and five
other insurers, as defendants. The activities alleged in the

Employee Benefits Complaint,

with certain exceptions,
track the allegations of contingent commissions, bid-rigging and
tying made in the

Commercial Complaint.

On October 3, 2006, Judge Hochberg of the District of New
Jersey reserved in part and denied in part motions filed by the
insurer defendants and broker defendants to dismiss the
multi-district litigation. The Court also ordered the plaintiffs
in both actions to file supplemental statements of particularity
to elaborate on the allegations in their complaints. Plaintiffs
filed their supplemental statements on October 25, 2006,
and the AIG defendants, along with other insurer and broker
defendants in the two consolidated actions, filed renewed
motions to dismiss on November 30, 2006. Briefing has been
completed on the renewed motions to dismiss, as well as
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in both cases.
On February 16, 2007, Chief Judge Brown of the District of
New Jersey transferred the multi-district litigation to himself.
Oral argument on the renewed motions to dismiss has been
scheduled before Chief Judge Brown on March 1, 2007. Fact
discovery in the multi-district litigation is ongoing.

A number of complaints making allegations similar to those in
the

Commercial Complaint

have been filed against AIG and
other defendants in state and federal courts around the country.
The defendants have thus far been successful in having the
federal actions transferred to the District of New Jersey and
consolidated into the multi-district litigation. The defendants
have also sought to have state court actions making similar
allegations stayed pending resolution of the multi-district
litigation. In one state court action pending in Florida, the
trial court recently decided not to grant an additional stay,
but instead to allow the case to proceed.

Litigation Relating to 21st Century.

Shortly after
the announcement in late January 2007 of AIG’s offer to
acquire the outstanding shares of 21st Century not already
owned by AIG and its subsidiaries, two related class actions
were filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles
County against AIG, 21st Century and the individual members
of 21st Century’s Board of Directors, two of whom are
current executive officers of AIG. The actions were filed
purportedly on behalf of the minority shareholders of
21st Century and assert breaches of fiduciary duty in
connection with the AIG proposal. The complaints allege that the
proposed per share price is unfair and seek preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief to enjoin the consummation of the
proposed transaction.

SICO.

In July, 2005, SICO filed a complaint against AIG
in the Southern District of New York, claiming that AIG had
refused to provide SICO access to certain artwork and asked the
court to order AIG immediately to release the property to SICO.
AIG filed an answer denying SICO’s allegations and setting
forth defenses to SICO’s claims. In addition, AIG filed
counterclaims asserting breach of contract, unjust enrichment,
conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, a constructive trust and
declaratory judgment, relating to SICO’s breach of its
commitment to use its AIG shares only for the benefit of AIG and
AIG employees. Fact and expert discovery has been substantially
concluded and briefing on SICO’s motion for summary
judgment is underway.

Effect on AIG

In the opinion of AIG management, AIG’s ultimate liability
for the unresolved matters referred to above is not likely to
have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated
financial condition, although it is possible that the effect
would be material to AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for an individual reporting period.

The approximate number of holders of common stock as of
January 31, 2007, based upon the number of record holders,
was 58,000.

Subject to the dividend preference of any of AIG’s serial
preferred stock that may be outstanding, the holders of shares
of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be
declared by AIG’s Board of Directors from funds legally
available therefor.

In February 2007, AIG’s Board of Directors adopted a new
dividend policy, to take effect with the dividend to be declared
in the second quarter of 2007, providing that under ordinary
circumstances, AIG’s plan will be to increase its common
stock dividend by approximately 20 percent annually. The payment
of any dividend, however, is at the discretion of AIG’s
Board of Directors, and the future payment of dividends will
depend on various factors, including the performance of
AIG’s businesses, AIG’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations and liquidity and the existence
of investment opportunities.

For a discussion of certain restrictions on the payment of
dividends to AIG by some of its insurance subsidiaries, see
Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selected Consolidated Financial
Data

The Selected Consolidated Financial
Data should be read in conjunction with Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations and the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included elsewhere herein.

(a)

Represents the sum of General Insurance net premiums earned,
    Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums and net
    investment income, Financial Services interest, lease and
    finance charges, Asset Management net investment income from
    spread-based products and advisory and management fees, and
    realized capital gains (losses).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its
operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful.
Statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios
are presented in accordance with accounting principles
prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are
standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry
and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s
insurance competitors. AIG has also incorporated into this
discussion a number of cross-references to additional
information included throughout this Annual Report on Form

to assist readers
seeking additional information related to a particular subject.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is
designed to provide the reader a narrative explanation of
AIG’s operations, financial condition and liquidity and
certain other significant matters.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Continued

Overview of Operations and Business
Results

AIG identifies its reportable segments by product or service
line, consistent with its management structure. AIG’s major
product and service groupings are General Insurance, Life
Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and
Asset Management. AIG’s operations in 2006 were conducted
by its subsidiaries through these segments. Through these
segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment
products and services to both businesses and individuals in more
than 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic,
product and service diversification is one of AIG’s major
strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. AIG’s
Other category consists of items not allocated to AIG’s
operating segments.

AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and
individual customers through an extensive

property-casualty

and
life insurance and retirement services network. In the United
States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial
and industrial insurance and are among the largest life
insurance and retirement services operations as well. AIG’s
Financial Services businesses include commercial aircraft and
equipment leasing, capital markets operations and consumer
finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides
asset management services to institutions and individuals. As
part of its spread-based business activities, AIG issues various
debt instruments in the public and private markets.

AIG’s operating performance reflects implementation of
various long-term strategies and defined goals in its various
operating segments. A primary goal of AIG in managing its
General Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting
profit. To achieve this goal, AIG must be disciplined in its
risk selection, and premiums must be adequate and terms and
conditions appropriate to cover the risks accepted and expenses
incurred. Expense efficiency is also a primary goal of AIG.

A central focus of AIG operations in recent years has been the
development and expansion of distribution channels. In 2006, AIG
continued to expand its distribution channels, which now include
banks, credit card companies, television-media home shopping,
affinity groups, direct response, worksite marketing and

e-commerce.

AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world
where it sees long-term growth opportunities. For example, the
fact that AIG has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance
operations in eleven cities in China is the result of
relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIG’s more
recent extensions of operations into India, Vietnam, Russia and
other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy.
Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and
infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When
AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer
both basic protection and savings products. As the economies
evolve, AIG’s products evolve with them, to more
sophisticated and investment-oriented models.

Growth for AIG may be generated internally as well as through
acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer
adequate return on capital. During 2006, AIG acquired Travel
Guard International, one of the nation’s leading providers
of travel insurance programs and emergency travel assistance,
and acquired Central Insurance Co., Ltd., a leading general
insurance company in Taiwan.

Outlook

The commercial property and casualty insurance industry has
historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by
rate strengthening as a result of catastrophe or other
significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the
industry to provide coverage. Despite industry price erosion in
commercial lines, AIG expects to continue to identify profitable
opportunities and build attractive new general insurance
businesses as a result of AIG’s broad product line and
extensive distribution networks in the U.S. and abroad. Workers
compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure, as
statutory rates continue to decline. Rates for D&O insurance
also continue to decline due to competitive pressures. There can
be no assurance that price erosion will not become more
widespread or that AIG’s profitability will not deteriorate
from current levels in major commercial lines, as well as in
personal lines and specialty coverages, such as mortgage
guaranty, where the loss ratio has increased due to softening in
the U.S. housing market and the weakening performance of
non-traditional mortgage products. In Foreign General,
opportunities for growth exist in the consumer lines due to
increased demand in emerging markets and the trend toward
privatization of health insurance. Growth in the Personal Lines
marketplace remains challenged from flat renewal pricing,
consumer price shopping and increased advertising spending by
market leaders. However, the high net worth market continues to
provide opportunities for growth as a result of AIG’s
innovative products and services specifically designed for that
market. AIG expects that the acquisition of the remaining
interest in 21st Century will enhance AIG’s ability to
grow the Personal Lines business while gaining efficiencies of
scale.

Losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to
year, making comparisons of results more difficult. With respect
to catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken
appropriate steps, such as careful exposure selection and
adequate reinsurance coverage, to reduce the effect of possible
future losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events
of unanticipated frequency or severity, such as a terrorist
attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes insured losses,
however, could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

AIG’s operations in China continue to expand, but AIG
expects competition in China to remain strong and AIG’s
success in China will depend on its ability to execute its
growth strategy.

In India, AIG expects to grow all segments, both organically and
through acquisitions and joint ventures.

In Japan, AIG expects its Life Insurance & Retirement
Services earnings growth may be challenged by increased
competition in light of a new industry-wide mortality table, the
continued runoff of the older, higher-margin in-force business
of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life and lower consumer demand
for certain accident and health products in light of tax law
changes. The flat yield curve and declining Yen foreign exchange
environment may continue to constrain certain fixed annuity
production. To leverage

AIG’s leadership position in the distribution of annuities
through banks in Japan, ALICO launched new life products in this
distribution channel. Although ALICO’s direct marketing
activities in Japan could experience a contraction while it
re-positions its brand and products in a very competitive
market, AIG expects that further deregulation will provide
additional growth opportunities. In addition, AIG expects that
the planned integration of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life
will provide enhanced distribution opportunities and scale
economies with an anticipated completion date of 2009.

AIG is a leader in direct marketing through sponsors and in the
broad market in Japan and Korea, and AIG is investing in
expanding distribution channels in India, Korea and Vietnam.

Through new operations in Bahrain designed to comply with
Islamic law, AIG is tapping into a growing market. Islamic
insurance, called Takaful, is an alternative to conventional
insurance based on the concept of mutual assistance through
pooling of resources.

Domestically, AIG plans to continue expansion of its Life
Insurance & Retirement Services businesses through
direct marketing and independent agent distribution channels.
The aging population in the U.S. provides a growth opportunity
for a variety of products, including longevity, guaranteed
income and supplemental accident and health products. Certain
other demographic groups that have traditionally been
underserved provide additional growth opportunities. The home
service operation, a slow growth business, has not met business
objectives, although its cash flow has been steady. Domestic
group life/health operations continue to face competitors with
greater scale in group benefits. At the end of 2006, AIG exited
the financial institutions credit life business in the U.S. as a
result of competition from bank products and low profit margins.
The individual fixed annuities business will continue to be
challenged due to the interest rate environment and increased
competition from bank products, while lower margin variable
annuity products with living benefits will continue to be the
product of consumer choice in the individual variable annuity
markets. The group annuity market is undergoing a transition
from group annuities to mutual fund products that have lower
profit margins.

Globally, heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial services
companies in many jurisdictions has the potential to affect
future financial results through higher compliance costs. This
is particularly true in Japan and Southeast Asia where financial
institutions have received remediation orders affecting consumer
and policyholder rights.

Within Financial Services, demand for ILFC’s modern, fuel
efficient aircraft remains strong, and ILFC plans to increase
its fleet by purchasing 83 aircraft in 2007. However,
ILFC’s margins may be adversely affected by further
increases in interest rates. AIGFP expects opportunities for
growth across its product segments, but AIGFP is a
transaction-oriented business, and its operating results will
depend to a significant extent on actual transaction flow, which
can be affected by market conditions and other variables outside
its control. AIG continues to explore opportunities to expand
its Consumer Finance operations into new foreign markets.
Consumer Finance operations overseas were negatively affected in
2006 by industry-wide credit deterioration in the Taiwan credit
card market, however, and operating results in the
U.S. could be affected by the residential housing market,
interest rates and unemployment.

The GIC portfolio, which is reported within the Asset Management
segment, continues to run off and the MIP has replaced the GIC
program as AIG’s principal institutional spread-based
investment activity. The MIP program is expected to continue to
grow in 2007. Because the asset mix under the MIP does not
include the alternative investments utilized in the GIC program,
however, AIG does not expect that the income growth in the MIP
will offset the runoff in the GIC portfolio for the foreseeable
future.

For a description of important factors that may affect the
operations and initiatives described above, see Item 1A.
Risk Factors.

The following table summarizes
AIG’s consolidated revenues, income before income taxes,

2006 and 2005 Comparison

The 4 percent growth in revenues in 2006 was primarily
attributable to the growth in net premiums earned and net
investment income from General Insurance operations and growth
in Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums
and net investment income. Revenues in the Financial Services
segment declined as a result of the effect of hedging activities
for AIGFP that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
under FAS 133, decreasing revenues by $1.8 billion in
2006 and increasing revenues by $2.01 billion in 2005.

Income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative
effect of accounting changes increased 43 percent in 2006
compared to 2005, reflecting higher General Insurance and Life
Insurance & Retirement Services operating income. These
increases were partially offset by lower Financial Services
operating income reflecting the effects of hedging activities
that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
FAS 133. Results in

2005 reflected the negative effect of $3.28 billion
(pre-tax) in catastrophe-related losses incurred that year. Net
income in 2005 also reflected the charges related to regulatory
settlements, as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and the
fourth quarter charge resulting from the annual review of
General Insurance loss and loss adjustment reserves.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Revenues grew 12 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily
due to the growth in net premiums earned from General Insurance
operations as well as growth in both General Insurance and Life
Insurance & Retirement Services net investment income
and Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums.
Hedging activities for AIGFP that did not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment under FAS 133 caused an increase in
Financial Services revenues of $2.01 billion in 2005 and a
decrease of $122 million in 2004.

AIG’s income before income taxes, minority interest and
cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 2 percent
in 2005 compared to 2004. Life Insurance & Retirement
Services, Financial Services and Asset Management operating
income gains accounted for the increase over 2004 in both pretax
income and net income. Offsetting these gains was the effect of
the charges related to regulatory settlements.

Remediation and Other Items

Throughout 2006, as part of its continuing remediation efforts,
AIG recorded out of period adjustments. The net effect of out of
period adjustments relating to prior years increased 2006 net
income by $65 million. The more significant adjustments
included increases in unit investment trust income of
$773 million ($428 million after tax) (more fully
described below) and other expenses of $356 million
($231 million after tax), and a decrease in revenues for
certain derivative transactions of $300 million ($145
million after tax).

During the fourth quarter, as part of its ongoing remediation
efforts, AIG recorded out of period adjustments. These
adjustments collectively increased net income in the fourth
quarter by $56 million but were offset by fourth quarter
charges to expense within Domestic Life for the adverse ruling
in the Superior National arbitration of $125 million
($81 million after tax) and a charge of $66 million
($43 million after tax) in connection with the exit of the
financial institutions credit life business. The more
significant out of period adjustments included the following: a
decrease in income tax expense of $181 million relating to
AIG’s ongoing remediation of internal controls over income
tax accounting, an increase in other expenses of
$167 million ($109 million after tax) relating to
AIG’s remediation of internal controls over reconciliation
of certain balance sheet accounts, an increase in incurred
policy losses and benefits of $103 million ($67 million after
tax) in Domestic General Insurance for corrections of certain
reserves for losses and loss expenses, a reduction in incurred
policy benefits in the Foreign Life participating policyholder
fund stemming from deferred tax adjustments in Foreign Life of
$190 million ($124 million after tax), an increase in
insurance operating expenses of $61 million
($40 million after tax) within Foreign Life for corrections
of expense allocations to certain par fund accounts, and a
$79 million ($51 million after tax) charge related to
purchases of life insurance policies for AIG’s life
settlements portfolio that were issued by AIG subsidiaries.

During 2006, AIG identified and recorded out of period
adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in
unit investment trusts in accordance with FIN 46(R),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and APB
Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.” These investments had
previously been accounted for as available for sale securities,
with changes in market values being reflected in other
comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. Beginning
with the second quarter of 2006, the changes in market values
are included in net investment income. The adjustments decreased
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of
investments — net of reclassification adjustments, and
the related deferred income tax benefit (expense), in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) by
approximately $659 million and approximately
$231 million, respectively, and increased net investment
income by $844 million, increased Incurred policy losses
and benefits (related to certain participating policyholder
funds) by $71 million, increased Income taxes by
$231 million and increased minority interest expense by
$114 million in the Consolidated Statement of Income. There was
no effect on Total shareholders’ equity at
December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005.

Results for 2006 were negatively affected by a one-time charge
relating to the Starr tender offer ($54 million before and
after tax) and an additional allowance for losses in AIG Credit
Card Company (Taiwan) ($94 million before and after tax).

The effective income tax rate increased from 28.0 percent
for 2005 to 30.1 percent for 2006, reflecting changes in the
sources of foreign taxable income, the effect of the phase out
of synfuel tax credits, the effect of consolidating certain
limited partnerships and a reduction in the proportion of total
income derived from tax exempt income, which was partially
offset by the aforementioned out of period income tax
adjustments.

There were no significant catastrophe-related losses for the
year ended December 31, 2006.

effect of catastrophe-related losses for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Segment Results

The following table summarizes the
operations of each principal segment for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. See also Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(a)

Includes the effect of hedging activities that did not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133,
    including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the effect was
    $(1.86) billion, $2.02 billion and $385 million
    in revenues and $(1.86) billion, $2.02 billion and
    $671 million in operating income. These amounts result
    primarily from interest rate and foreign currency derivatives
    that are hedging available for sale securities and
    borrowings.

(h)

Includes consolidation and elimination adjustments which
    increased revenues and operating income by $296 million and
    $74 million, respectively, in 2006.

(i)

Represents income before income taxes, minority interest, and
    cumulative effect of accounting changes.

(j)

Includes current year catastrophe-related losses of
    $3.28 billion and $1.16 billion in 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. There were no significant catastrophe-related
    losses in 2006. Includes additional losses incurred and net
    reinstatement premiums related to prior year catastrophes of
    $165 million and $292 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

(k)

Includes current year catastrophe-related losses from
    unconsolidated subsidiaries of $312 million and
    $96 million in 2005 and 2004. There were no significant
    catastrophe-related losses in 2006.

General Insurance

AIG’s General Insurance operations provide property and
casualty products and services throughout the world. The
increase in General Insurance operating income in 2006 compared
to 2005 was primarily attributable to an improvement in
underwriting results for DBG, including the absence of
catastrophe-related losses, which amounted to $2.89 billion
in 2005. Operating income for 2006 also reflected higher net
investment income, including the effect of the out of period
adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in
unit investment trusts.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services

AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services
operations provide insurance, financial and investment products
throughout the world. Foreign operations contributed
approximately 68 percent, 59 percent and
61 percent of AIG’s Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operating income in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income
increased 13 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 on higher
GAAP premiums and an increase in net investment income. Net
investment income in 2006 included the effect of an out of
period adjustment related to the accounting for certain
interests in unit investment trusts. Realized capital gains
included in revenues and operating income were $88 million
in 2006 compared to realized capital losses of $158 million
in 2005. Results for 2006 were particularly strong in the
Foreign Life operations that were helped by increased net
investment income, higher realized gains and lower acquisition
costs. Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services
operating income declined from the prior year on lower realized
gains, the charge discussed above relating to the Superior
National arbitration and the exiting of the financial
institutions credit insurance business.

Financial Services

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified
activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance.

Financial Services operating income decreased in 2006 compared
to 2005 primarily due to the effects of hedging activities that
did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
FAS 133. AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting in the first
quarter of 2007 for AIGFP. In addition to the effects of
FAS 133, fluctuations in revenues and operating income from

period are not unusual because of the transaction-oriented
nature of Capital Markets operations.

Asset Management

AIG’s Asset Management operations include institutional and
retail asset management, broker-dealer services and
institutional spread-based investment businesses. The MIP has
replaced the GIC program as AIG’s principal spread-based
investment activity.

Asset Management operating income increased 4 percent in
2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to growth in asset
management fees within Institutional Asset Management and income
from the MIP. These increases were partially offset by the
continued runoff of GIC balances, spread compression in the
remaining GIC portfolio as well as decreased performance-based
fees. Gains and losses arising from the consolidation of certain
variable interest entities (VIEs) and partnerships are included
in operating income, but are offset in minority interest
expense, which is not a component of operating income.

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2006, AIG had total consolidated
shareholders’ equity of $101.68 billion and total
consolidated borrowings of $148.68 billion. At that date,
$131.55 billion of such borrowings were not guaranteed by
AIG, were matched borrowings by AIG or AIGFP, or represented
liabilities connected to trust preferred stock.

AIG did not purchase shares of its common stock under its common
stock repurchase authorization during 2006. In February 2007,
AIG’s Board of Directors increased the repurchase program
by authorizing the repurchase of shares with an aggregate
purchase price of $8 billion.

In 2007, AIG expects to issue capital securities in one or more
series. The proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of common
stock or to otherwise improve the efficiency of AIG’s
capital structure.

Liquidity

AIG manages liquidity at both the subsidiary and parent company
levels. At December 31, 2006, AIG’s consolidated
invested assets, primarily held by its subsidiaries, included
$26.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2006
amounted to $6.8 billion. At the parent company level,
liquidity management activities are conducted in a manner to
preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility, and
diversity through the full range of potential operating
environments and market conditions. AIG’s primary sources
of cash flow are dividends and other payments from its regulated
and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as issuances of debt
securities. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service,
subsidiary funding and shareholder dividend payments. Management
believes that AIG’s liquid assets, cash provided by
operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to
meet its anticipated cash requirements, including the funding of
increased dividends under AIG’s new dividend policy and
repurchases of common stock.

Critical Accounting Estimates

AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates to be those
relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy
benefits for life and accident and health contracts,
recoverability of DAC, estimated gross profits for
investment-oriented products, fair value determinations for
certain Capital Markets assets and liabilities,
other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments and
flight equipment recoverability. These accounting estimates
require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are
highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual
experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s results
of operations would be directly affected.

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG’s
critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major
categories for which assumptions are developed and used to
establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted
below. For a discussion regarding the significant accounting
policies relating to these estimates, see Note 1 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses
(General Insurance):

•

Loss trend factors:

used to establish expected loss
    ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate
    adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior
    accident years.

•

Expected loss ratios for the latest accident
    year:

in this case, accident year 2006 for the year end
    2006 loss reserve analysis. For low-frequency, high-severity
    classes such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally
    are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years.

•

Loss development factors:

used to project the
    reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount.

•

Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses:

the
    expected recoveries from reinsurers on losses that have not yet
    been reported and/or settled.

Future Policy Benefits for Life and
Accident and Health Contracts (Life Insurance &
Retirement Services):

•

Interest rates:

which vary by geographical region,
    year of issuance and products.

•

Mortality, morbidity and surrender rates:

based upon
    actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for
    variation in policy form, risk classification and distribution
    channel.

Estimated Gross Profits (Life
Insurance & Retirement Services):

•

Estimated gross profits:

to be realized over the
    estimated duration of the contracts (investment-oriented
    products) affect the carrying value of DAC, unearned revenue
    liability and associated amortization patterns under FAS 97
    and Sales Inducement Assets under
    SOP

03-1.

Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and
    losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality
    and other expenses.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (Life
Insurance & Retirement Services):

•

Recoverability:

based on current and future expected
    profitability, which is affected by interest rates, foreign
    exchange rates, mortality experience, and policy persistency.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
(General Insurance):

•

Recoverability and eligibility:

based upon the
    current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance
    contracts.

Fair Value Determinations Of Certain
Assets And Liabilities (Financial Services):

•

SD

Valuation models:

utilizing factors, such as market
    liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange and volatility
    rates.

•

Market price data:

AIG attempts to secure reliable
    and independent current market price data, such as published
    exchange rates from external subscription services such as
    Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker quotes for use in its
    models. When such data is not available, AIG uses an internal
    methodology, which includes interpolation and extrapolation from
    verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the
    dates of the transactions.

Other-Than-Temporary Declines In The Value
Of Investments:

A security is considered a candidate for other-than-temporary
impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:

•

Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to
    par or amortized cost (if lower) for an extended period of time
    (nine months or longer);

•

The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the
    debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection
    or voluntary reorganization; or

•

The probability of non-realization of a full recovery on its
    investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the
    foregoing events.

At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its securities
holdings in an unrealized loss position. Where AIG does not
intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered
their carrying value, based on the circumstances present at the
date of evaluation, AIG records the unrealized loss in income.
If events or circumstances change, such as unexpected changes in
the creditworthiness of the obligor, unanticipated changes in
interest rates, tax laws, statutory capital positions and
unforeseen liquidity events, among others, AIG revisits its
intent. Further, if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent
to a balance sheet date pursuant to these unexpected changes in
circumstances, the loss is recognized in the period in which the
intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer existed.

In periods subsequent to the recognition of an
other-than-temporary impairment loss for debt securities, AIG
amortizes the discount or reduced premium over the remaining
life of the security in a prospective manner based on the amount
and timing of estimated future cash flows.

Flight Equipment —
Recoverability (Financial Services):

•

Expected undiscounted future net cash flows:

based
    upon current lease rates, projected future lease rates and
    estimated terminal values of each aircraft based on third party
    information.

Operating Review

General Insurance Operations

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line
companies writing substantially all lines of commercial property
and casualty insurance and various personal lines both
domestically and abroad.

As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss
its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its
financial statement users. Accordingly, in its General Insurance
business, AIG uses certain regulatory measures, where AIG has
determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful.

A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business
is the objective to produce profit from underwriting activities
exclusive of investment-related income. When underwriting is not
profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses
and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the
addition of general insurance related investment income and
realized capital gains may, however, enable a general insurance
business to produce operating income. For these reasons, AIG
views underwriting results to be critical in the overall
evaluation of performance. See also Liquidity herein.

Statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net
premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net
expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires
immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of
revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for
statutory purposes, expenses (including acquisition costs) are
recognized immediately, not over the same period that the
revenues are earned. Thus, statutory expenses exclude changes in
DAC.

GAAP provides for the recognition of expenses at the same time
revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching.
Therefore, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over
the period the related net premiums written are earned. DAC is
reviewed for recoverability, and such review requires management
judgment. The most comparable GAAP measure to statutory
underwriting profit is income before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change. A table
reconciling statutory underwriting profit to income before
income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of an
accounting change is contained in footnote (g) to the
following table. See also Critical Accounting Estimates herein
and Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

AIG, along with most general insurance companies, uses the loss
ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of
underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses
and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The
expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net
premiums written. These ratios are relative measurements that
describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned or written, the

Continued

cost of losses and statutory expenses, respectively. The
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense
ratio. The combined ratio presents the total cost per $100 of
premium production. A combined ratio below 100 demonstrates
underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates
underwriting loss.

Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based
upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned
premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are
generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net
unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as
net premiums earned until the end of the policy period.

The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as
does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type
and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently
on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and
statutory general insurance ratios.

General Insurance Results

General Insurance operating income is
comprised of statutory underwriting results, changes in DAC, net
investment income and realized capital gains and losses.
Operating income, as well as net premiums written, net premiums
earned, net investment income and realized capital gains
(losses) and statutory ratios for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as
follows:

2006 and 2005 Comparison

General Insurance operating income increased in 2006 compared to
2005 due to growth in net premiums, a reduction in both
catastrophe losses and prior accident year development, and
growth in net investment income. The combined ratio improved to
89.1, a reduction of 15.6 points from 2005, including an
improvement in the loss ratio of 16.5 points. The reduction
in catastrophe losses represented 6.9 points and the
reduction in prior year adverse development represented
11.5 points of the overall reduction. Net premiums written
increased $3.0 billion or 7 percent in 2006 compared
to 2005. Domestic General accounted for $1.6 billion of the
increase as property rates improved and submission activity
increased due to the strength of AIG’s capacity, commitment
to difficult markets and diverse product offerings. Foreign
General contributed $1.4 billion to the increase in net
premiums written. In 2005, Domestic General net premiums written
increased by $300 million and Foreign General net premiums
written decreased by the same amount as a result of the
commutation of the Richmond reinsurance contract. The
commutation partially offset the increase in Domestic General
net premiums written in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased
Foreign General net premiums written in 2006 compared to 2005.

In 2006, certain adjustments were made in conjunction with the
remediation of the material weakness relating to balance sheet
account reconciliations which increased earned premiums by
$189 million and increased other expenses by
$415 million. These adjustments reflect continuing progress
in AIG’s ongoing remediation efforts. The combined effect
of these adjustments increased the expense ratio by
0.9 points and decreased the loss ratio by 0.3 points.

General Insurance net investment income increased
$1.67 billion in 2006 to $5.7 billion on higher levels
of invested assets, strong cash flows, slightly higher yields
and increased partnership income, and included increases from
out of period adjustments of $490 million related to the
accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts,
$43 million related to partnership income and
$85 million related to interest earned on a DBG deposit
contract. See also Capital Resources and Liquidity —
Liquidity and Invested Assets herein.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

General Insurance operating income in 2005 decreased from 2004
due to higher catastrophe-related losses and the fourth quarter
2005 increase in reserves and changes in estimates related to
remediation of the material weakness in reconciliation of
balance sheet accounts. Catastrophe-related losses were
$2.89 billion and $1.05 billion in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These decreases in operating income were partially
offset by strong growth in statutory underwriting profit and
increases in net investment income. General Insurance operating
income in 2004 also included a $232 million charge
reflecting a change in estimate for salvage and subrogation
recoveries.

General Insurance net investment income grew in 2005 compared to
2004 due to strong cash flows, higher interest rates and
increased partnership income. See also Capital Resources and
Liquidity — Liquidity herein and Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

DBG Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

DBG’s operating income increased to $5.99 billion in
2006 compared to a loss of $646 million in 2005, an
improvement of $6.63 billion. The improvement is also
reflected in the combined ratio, which declined to 89.4 in 2006
compared to 113.8 in 2005 primarily due to an improvement in the
loss ratio of 24.9 points. The reduction in prior year
adverse development and the reduction in catastrophe losses and
related reinstatement premiums accounted for 21.0 points
and 8.2 points, respectively, of the improvement.

DBG’s net premiums written increased 5 percent in 2006
compared to 2005 as property rates improved and submission
activity increased due to the strength of AIG’s capacity,
commitment to difficult markets and diverse product offerings.
Net premiums written in 2005 were reduced by $122 million
due to reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes, offset by
increases of $300 million for the Richmond commutation and
$147 million related to an accrual for workers compensation
premiums for payroll not yet reported by insured employers. The
combined effect of these items reduced the growth rate for net
premiums written by 1.5 percent.

The loss ratio for 2006 declined 24.9 points to 69.4. The
2005 loss ratio was negatively affected by catastrophe-related
losses of $1.7 billion and related reinstatement premiums
of $122 million. Adverse development on reserves for loss
and loss adjustment expenses declined to $110 million in
2006 compared to $4.9 billion in 2005, accounting for
21.0 points of the decrease in the loss ratio.

DBG’s expense ratio increased to 20.0 in 2006 compared to
19.5 in 2005, primarily due to an increase in other expenses
that amounted to $498 million in 2006 (including out of
period charges of $356 million) compared to
$372 million in 2005. This increase added 0.4 points
to the expense ratio. Overall allowances decreased, however, due
to charge-offs against previously established allowances
resulting from AIG’s remediation activities.

DBG’s net investment income increased by $1.0 billion
in 2006 compared to 2005, as interest income increased
$482 million on growth in the bond portfolio resulting from
investment of operating cash flows and capital contributions.
Partnership income

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

increased from 2005 due to improved performance of the
underlying investments, including initial public offering
activity. Net investment income in 2006 included increases
relating to out of period adjustments of $109 million for
the accounting for certain investments in unit investment trusts
and partnerships and $85 million related to interest earned
on a deposit contract that did not exist in the prior year.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

DBG’s net premiums written increased modestly in 2005
compared to 2004, reflecting generally improving renewal
retention rates and a modest change in the mix of business
towards smaller accounts for which DBG purchases less
reinsurance. DBG also continued to expand its relationships with
a larger number and broader range of brokers. DBG saw
improvement in domestic property rates as well as increases in
submission activity in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes. DBG
attributes the increase in submissions to its overall financial
strength in comparison to many insurers that experienced
significant losses and reductions of surplus as a result of the
hurricanes.

The DBG loss ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally as a
result of adverse loss development, higher catastrophe-related
losses and $197 million of losses incurred in 2005
resulting from the 2004 catastrophes.

The DBG expense ratio increased in 2005 from 2004, principally
due to an increase in net commissions resulting from the
replacement of certain ceded quota share reinsurance, for which
DBG earns a ceding commission, with

excess-of

-loss
reinsurance, which generally does not include a ceding
commission. Increases in other underwriting expenses reflect a
change in estimates for salvage and subrogation recoveries.

DBG’s net investment income increased in 2005 compared to
2004 due to strong cash flows, higher interest rates and
increased partnership income.

Transatlantic Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Transatlantic’s net premiums written and net premiums
earned increased in 2006 by 5 percent and 6 percent,
respectively, compared to 2005 due primarily to increased
writings in domestic operations. Operating income increased in
2006 compared to 2005 due largely to lower catastrophe losses
and net ceded reinstatement premiums, and increased net
investment income.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Transatlantic’s net premiums written and net premiums
earned for 2005 decreased compared to 2004, principally due to
competitive market conditions and increased ceding company
retentions in certain classes of business, largely resulting
from Transatlantic’s domestic operations. Operating income
decreased principally as a result of the increased level of
catastrophe losses.

Personal Lines Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Personal Lines operating income increased $237 million in
2006 compared to 2005 reflecting a reduction in the loss ratio
of 5.8 points. Favorable development on prior accident
years reduced incurred losses by $111 million in 2006 compared
to an increase of $14 million in 2005, accounting for
2.7 points of the decrease in the loss ratio. The 2005
catastrophe-related losses of $112 million added
2.4 points to the loss ratio. The loss ratio for the 2006
accident year improved 0.7 points primarily due to the
termination of The Robert Plan relationship effective
December 31, 2005 and growth in the Private Client Group.
The improvement in the loss ratio was partially offset by an
increase in the expense ratio of 0.6 points primarily due
to investments in people and technology, national expansion
efforts and lower response rates. Net premiums written were flat
in 2006 compared to 2005, with growth in the Private Client
Group and Agency Auto divisions offset by termination of The
Robert Plan relationship. Growth in the Private Client Group
spans multiple products, with a continued penetration of the
high net worth market, strong brand promotion and innovative
loss prevention programs.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Personal Lines net premiums written and net premiums earned for
2005 increased compared to 2004 as a result of strong growth in
the Private Client Group and Agency Auto divisions due to
increased agent/broker appointments, greater market penetration
and enhanced product offerings. AIG direct premiums in 2005 were
down slightly from 2004 due to aggressive re-underwriting of the
previously acquired GE business and the discontinuation of
underwriting homeowners business. Involuntary auto premiums were
down in 2005 due to the decline in the assigned risk
marketplace. Statutory underwriting profit declined in 2005 as a
result of hurricane losses and related expenses, reserve
strengthening, an increase in Agency Auto’s current
accident year physical damage loss ratio, and expenses incurred
related to terminating AIG’s relationship with The Robert
Plan effective December 31, 2005.

Mortgage Guaranty Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

UGC’s operating income declined $35 million in 2006,
down 10 percent from 2005 due primarily to unfavorable loss
experience on third-party originated second lien business with a
credit quality lower than typical for UGC and a softening U.S.
housing market. This increased UGC’s consolidated loss
ratio for 2006 to 47.2 compared to 26.0 in 2005. The writing of
this second lien coverage, which began in 2005, was discontinued
as of year end 2006. Losses in the second lien business have
been mitigated by a policy year aggregate limitation provision
that is typically established for each lender.

Net premiums written increased 38 percent from growth in
the domestic second lien and international businesses as well as
improved persistency in the domestic first lien business. The

Form

expense ratio remained flat as premium growth covered increased
expenses related to expansion internationally and continued
investment in risk management resources. UGC had approximately
$27 billion of guaranty risk in force at December 31,
2006.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

UGC’s net premiums written were up slightly for 2005
compared to 2004 as strong growth in the international and
domestic second lien businesses was mostly offset by lower
persistency in domestic first lien residential renewal premiums.
Statutory underwriting profit rose from 2004 due to lower
contract underwriting expenses and favorable loss development.

Foreign General Insurance
Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Foreign General’s operating income increased
$661 million or 27 percent in 2006 compared to 2005
due to out of period adjustments related to the accounting for
interests in unit investment trusts, the absence of significant
catastrophe-related losses in 2006, rate increases and lower
current accident year losses by the Lloyd’s syndicate Ascot
(Ascot) on its U.S. book of business and lower asbestos and
environmental reserve increases. Partially offsetting these
increases in operating income were lower favorable loss
development from prior accident years and adverse loss
development on the 2005 hurricanes. Statutory underwriting
profit increased $152 million in 2006 compared to 2005.
Catastrophes in 2005 resulted in losses of $293 million and
reinstatement premiums of $94 million.

Net premiums written increased $1.4 billion or
14 percent (15 percent in original currency) in 2006
compared to 2005, reflecting growth in both commercial and
consumer lines driven by new business from both established and
new distribution channels, including a wholly owned insurance
company in Vietnam and Central Insurance Co., Ltd. in Taiwan.
Ascot also contributed to the growth in net premiums written as
a result of rate increases on its U.S. business. Consumer
lines in Latin America and commercial lines in Europe, including
the U.K., also contributed to the increase. Net premiums written
for 2005 were reduced by reinstatement premiums related to
catastrophes and a portfolio transfer of unearned premium
reserves to DBG related to the Richmond commutation, accounting
for 3 percent of the increase in 2006 compared to 2005.

The 2006 combined ratio declined to 83.7, a decrease of
1.9 points from 2005. The 2005 catastrophes added
3.5 points to the 2005 loss ratio. The expense ratio in
2006 increased by 1.3 points as a result of increased
amortization of deferred advertising costs and a continued
change in the business mix towards products with higher
acquisition costs but historically lower loss ratios. The loss
ratio decreased 3.2 points in 2006 as the absence of
significant catastrophes in 2006 resulted in a decrease of
3.5 points, rate increases and lower current year losses by
Ascot on its U.S. book of business accounted for
1.3 points of the decrease and lower asbestos and
environmental reserve increases accounted for 1.2 points of
the decrease. These declines were partially offset by lower
favorable loss development from prior accident years and adverse
development on 2005 hurricanes.

The expense ratio increased 1.3 points in 2006 compared to
2005. Underwriting expenses for 2006 increased $59 million
due to an out of period adjustment for amortization of deferred
advertising costs and premiums were reduced by $61 million
due to reconciliation remediation activities, in aggregate
accounting for 0.7 points of the increase in the expense
ratio. The expense ratio also increased due to growth in
consumer business lines, which have higher acquisition expenses
but historically lower loss ratios. The expense ratio for 2005
increased by 1.2 points due to the decline in net premiums
written from reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes and
the portfolio transfer of the Richmond unearned premium
reserves. Due to the current mix of business, AIG expects the
expense ratio to continue to increase during 2007, principally
for classes of business with historically lower than average
loss ratios.

Net investment income increased $540 million or
57 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a
$424 million out of period adjustment related to the
accounting for interests in unit investment trusts.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Foreign General operating income increased 81 percent in
2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to favorable loss
development from prior accident years and increased net
investment income.

Net premiums written increased 6 percent (4 percent in
original currency) in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of new
business as well as new distribution channels such as the
February 2005 purchase of the insurance portfolio of the
Royal & Sun Alliance branch operations in Japan. The
personal accident business in the Far East and the personal
lines operations in Latin America also contributed to the
growth. Partially offsetting these increases was the portfolio
transfer of Richmond’s unearned premium reserves to DBG,
which reduced net premiums in 2005 and reinstatement premiums
related to catastrophes.

The 2005 combined ratio of 85.6 decreased 5.3 points from 2004.
The loss ratio decreased 8.0 points in 2005 from 2004. The
loss ratio decreased 4.7 points due to favorable loss
development from prior accident years, excluding catastrophes,
and 2.3 points related to a 2004 loss reserve restatement
adjustment. The loss ratio increased 0.9 points due to
higher catastrophe losses in 2005 related to hurricanes. The
expense ratio increased 2.7 points in 2005 from 2004
principally due to the portfolio transfer of Richmond’s
unearned premium reserves to DBG in 2005, loyalty business
initiatives in the consumer business lines, which have higher
acquisition costs, and also due to reinstatement premiums.

Foreign General net investment income increased
$326 million in 2005 compared to 2004 on increased
partnership income, reflecting increases in market valuations of
infrastructure fund investments in Africa, Asia, China, Eastern
Europe and India. Additionally, net investment income was
positively affected by positive cash flows, higher interest
rates and the compounding of previously earned and reinvested
net investment income. Cash flow was lower in 2005 compared to
2004 due to payments for

Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses

The following table presents the
components of the General Insurance gross reserve for losses and
loss expenses (loss reserves) as of December 31, 2006 and
2005 by major lines of business on a statutory Annual Statement
basis*:

*

Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory
    reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association
    of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

AIG’s gross reserve for losses and loss expenses represents
the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR
and loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve
estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are
continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments
resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently.
Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of
future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that
loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in
trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that
increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as
unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening.
Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate
cost are referred to as favorable development.

At December 31, 2006, General Insurance net loss reserves
increased $5.15 billion from 2005 to $62.63 billion. The net
loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance
recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance
and applicable discount for future investment income.

The following table classifies the
components of the General Insurance net loss reserves by
business unit as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, DBG loss
    reserves include approximately $3.33 billion and
    $3.77 billion ($3.66 billion and $4.26 billion,
    respectively, before discount), related to business written by
    DBG but ceded to AIRCO and reported in AIRCO’s statutory
    filings. DBG loss reserves also include approximately $535
    million and $407 million related to business included in
    AIUO’s statutory filings at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

(b)

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, Personal

    $878 million related to business ceded to DBG and reported
    in DBG’s statutory filings.

(c)

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, Foreign
    General loss reserves include approximately $2.87 billion and
    $2.15 billion related to business reported in DBG’s
    statutory filings.

The DBG net loss reserve of $44.0 billion is comprised
principally of the business of AIG subsidiaries participating in
the American Home/ National Union pool (11 companies) and
the surplus lines pool (Lexington, Starr Excess Liability
Insurance Company and Landmark Insurance Company).

Beginning in 1998, DBG ceded a quota share percentage of its
other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence
business to AIRCO. The quota share percentage ceded was
40 percent in 1998, 65 percent in 1999,
75 percent in 2000 and 2001, 50 percent in 2002 and
2003, 40 percent in 2004, 35 percent in 2005 and
20 percent in 2006 and covered all business written in
these years for these lines by participants in the American
Home/ National Union pool. In 1998 the cession reflected only
the other liability occurrence business, but in 1999 and
subsequent years included products liability occurrence.
AIRCO’s loss reserves relating to these quota share
cessions from DBG are recorded on a discounted basis. As of
year-end 2006, AIRCO carried a discount of approximately $330
million applicable to the $3.66 billion in undiscounted reserves
it assumed from the American Home/ National Union pool via this
quota share cession. AIRCO also carries approximately $467
million in net loss reserves relating to Foreign General
insurance business. These reserves are carried on an
undiscounted basis.

Beginning in 1997, the Personal Lines division ceded a
percentage of all business written by the companies
participating in the personal lines pool to the American Home/
National Union pool. As noted above, the total reserves carried
by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool
relating to this cession amounted to $861 million as of year-end
2006.

The companies participating in the American Home/ National Union
pool have maintained a participation in the business written by
AIU for decades. As of year-end 2006, these AIU reserves carried
by participants in the American Home/ National Union pool
amounted to approximately $2.87 billion. The remaining Foreign

General reserves are carried by AIUO, AIRCO, and other smaller
AIG subsidiaries domiciled outside the United States. Statutory
filings in the U.S. by AIG companies reflect all the
business written by U.S. domiciled entities only, and
therefore exclude business written by AIUO, AIRCO, and all other
internationally domiciled subsidiaries. The total reserves
carried at year-end 2006 by AIUO and AIRCO were approximately
$4.57 billion and $3.80 billion, respectively. AIRCO’s
$3.80 billion in total general insurance reserves consists of
approximately $3.33 billion from business assumed from the
American Home/ National Union pool and an additional $467
million relating to Foreign General Insurance business.

Discounting of Reserves

At December 31, 2006, AIG’s overall General Insurance
net loss reserves reflect a loss reserve discount of $2.26
billion, including tabular and non-tabular calculations. The
tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a
3.5 percent interest rate and the 1979-81 Decennial
Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers compensation discount
is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and
Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each
state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five
percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout
patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified
discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are
based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout
pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is
based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from
one to twenty years and the company’s own payout pattern,
with the future expected payment for each year using the
interest rate associated with the corresponding Treasury
security yield for that time period. The discount is comprised
of the following: $662 million — tabular discount for
workers compensation in DBG; $1.27 billion —
non-tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; and, $330
million — non-tabular discount for other liability
occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO. The total
undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried by DBG is
approximately $11.5 billion as of year-end 2006. The other
liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business
in AIRCO that is assumed from DBG is discounted based on the
yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one to
twenty years and the DBG payout pattern for this business. The
undiscounted reserves assumed by AIRCO from DBG totaled
approximately $3.66 billion at December 31, 2006.

Results of 2006 Reserving
Process

Management believes that the General Insurance net loss reserves
are adequate to cover General Insurance net losses and loss
expenses as of December 31, 2006. While AIG regularly
reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, there can be
no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not
develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s loss reserves
as of December 31, 2006. In the opinion of management, such
adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not
likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG’s
consolidated financial condition, although it could have a
material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for an individual reporting period. See also
Item 1A. Risk Factors — Casualty Insurance and
Underwriting Reserves.

The loss ratios recorded by AIG for 2006 took into account the
results of the comprehensive reserve reviews that were completed
in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG’s year-end 2005 reserve
review reflected careful consideration of the reserve analyses
prepared by AIG’s internal actuarial staff with the
assistance of third party actuaries. In determining the
appropriate loss ratios for accident year 2006 for each class of
business, AIG gave consideration to the loss ratios resulting
from the 2005 reserve analyses as well as all other relevant
information including rate changes, expected changes in loss
costs, changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of business, and
other factors that may affect the loss ratios.

In 2006, AIG enhanced its process of determining the quarterly
loss development from prior accident years. In the first quarter
of 2006, AIG began conducting additional analyses to determine
the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for
each profit center. For example, if loss emergence for a profit
center is different than expected for certain accident years,
the actuaries now take additional steps to examine the indicated
effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit
center. In some cases, the higher or lower than expected
emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss
estimate for the accident years in question, and no adjustment
would be made to the profit center’s reserves for prior
accident years. In other cases, the higher or lower than
expected emergence may result in a larger change, either
favorable or unfavorable, than the difference between the actual
and expected loss emergence. Such additional analyses were
conducted for each profit center, as appropriate, in the first,
second and third quarters of 2006 to determine the loss
development from prior accident years for the first, second and
third quarters of 2006. As part of its quarterly reserving
process, AIG also considers notices of claims received with
respect to emerging issues, such as those related to stock
option backdating. In the fourth quarter of 2006, a
comprehensive loss reserve review was completed for each AIG
general insurance subsidiary. The prior accident year loss
reserve development shown in the tables above for 2006 reflects
the results of these comprehensive reviews, including the effect
of actual loss emergence in the fourth quarter of 2006.

In 2006, net loss development from prior accident years was
favorable by approximately $53 million, including
approximately $198 million in net adverse development from
asbestos and environmental reserves resulting from the updated
ground up analysis of these exposures in the fourth quarter of
2006; approximately $103 million of adverse development
pertaining to the major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005; and
$181 million of adverse development from the general
reinsurance operations of Transatlantic; and excluding
approximately $300 million from accretion of loss reserve
discount. Excluding the fourth quarter asbestos and
environmental reserve increase, catastrophes and Transatlantic,
as well as accretion of discount, net loss development in 2006
from prior accident years was favorable by approximately
$535 million. The overall favorable development of
$53 million consisted of approximately $2.30 billion
of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2005,
partially offset by approximately $2.25 billion of adverse
development from accident years 2002 and prior. For 2006, most
classes of AIG’s business continued to experience favorable
development for accident years 2003 through 2005. The adverse
development from accident years 2002 and prior reflected
development from excess casualty, workers compensation, excess
workers compensation, and post-1986 environmental liability
classes of business, all within DBG, from asbestos reserves
within DBG and Foreign General, and from Transatlantic.

For 2005, net loss development from prior accident years was
adverse by approximately $4.68 billion, including
approximately $269 million from the general reinsurance
operations of Transatlantic. This $4.68 billion adverse
development in 2005 was comprised of approximately
$8.60 billion for the 2002 and prior accident years,
partially offset by favorable development for accident years
2003 and 2004 for most classes of business, with the notable
exception of D&O. The adverse loss development for 2002 and
prior accident years was attributable to approximately
$4.0 billion of development from the D&O and related
management liability classes of business, excess casualty, and
excess workers compensation, and to approximately
$900 million of adverse development from asbestos and
environmental claims. The remaining portion of the adverse
development from 2002 and

prior accident years included approximately $520 million
related to Transatlantic with the balance spread across many
other classes of business. Most classes of business produced
favorable development for accident years 2003 and 2004, and
adverse development for accident years 2001 and prior.

For 2004, AIG’s overall net loss reserve development from
prior accident years was an increase of approximately
$3.19 billion, including approximately $317 million
from the general reinsurance operations of Transatlantic and
excluding approximately $377 million from accretion of loss
reserve discount. This $3.19 billion adverse development in
2004 was comprised of approximately $4.67 billion of
adverse development for the 2002 and prior accident years,
partially offset by approximately $1.48 billion of
favorable development for accident year 2003. The adverse
development for the 2002 and prior accident years was primarily
attributable to excess casualty, D&O and related management
liability classes, and asbestos and environmental reserves, all
within DBG, and also to Transatlantic. Most classes of business
throughout AIG produced favorable development for accident year
2003.

The following is a discussion of the primary reasons for the
development in 2006, 2005 and 2004 for those classes of business
that experienced significant prior accident year developments
during the three-year period. See Asbestos and Environmental
Reserves below for a further discussion of asbestos and
environmental reserves and developments.

Excess Casualty:

Excess Casualty reserves experienced
significant adverse loss development in 2004 and 2005, but in
2006 there was only a relatively minor amount of adverse
development. The adverse development for all periods shown
related principally to accident years 2000 and prior, and to a
lesser extent 2001, and resulted from significant loss cost
increases due to both frequency and severity of claims. The
increase in loss costs resulted primarily from medical
inflation, which increased the economic loss component of tort
claims, advances in medical care, which extended the life span
of severely injured claimants, and larger jury verdicts, which
increased the value of severe tort claims. An additional factor
affecting AIG’s excess casualty experience in recent years
has been the accelerated exhaustion of underlying primary
policies for homebuilders. This has led to increased
construction defect-related claims activity on AIG’s excess
policies. Many excess casualty policies were written on a
multi-year basis in the late 1990s, which limited AIG’s
ability to respond to emerging market trends as rapidly as would
otherwise be the case. In subsequent years, AIG responded to
these emerging trends by increasing rates and implementing
numerous policy form and coverage changes. This led to a
significant improvement in experience beginning with accident
year 2001.

In the year-end 2004 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries
responded to the adverse development for excess casualty by
increasing the loss development factor assumptions. In the
year-end 2004 reserve study, the development factors applicable
to accident years 1998 and subsequent were increased by
approximately 12 percent. In addition, the expected loss
ratios for accident years 2002 and subsequent were increased to
take into account the higher ultimate loss ratios for accident
years 2001 and prior.

For the year-end 2005 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries
responded to the continuing adverse development by further
increasing the loss development factors applicable to accident
years 1999 and subsequent by approximately 5 percent. In
addition, to more accurately estimate losses for construction
defect-related claims, a separate review was performed by AIG
claims staff for accounts with significant exposure to these
claims.

For the year-end 2006 loss reserve review, AIG claims staff
updated the separate review for accounts with significant
exposure to construction defect-related claims in order to
assist the actuaries in determining the proper reserve for this
exposure. AIG’s actuaries determined that no significant
changes in the assumptions were required. Prior accident year
loss development in 2006 was adverse by approximately
$100 million, a relatively minor amount for this class of
business. However, AIG continues to experience adverse
development for this class for accident years prior to 2003.

Loss reserves pertaining to the excess casualty class of
business are generally included in the Other liability
occurrence line of business, with a small portion of the excess
casualty reserves included in the Other liability claims made
line of business, as presented in the table on page 37.

D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of
Business:

These classes of business experienced significant
adverse development in 2004 and 2005, but experienced slightly
favorable development in 2006. The adverse development in 2004
and 2005 related principally to accident years 2002 and prior.
This adverse development resulted from significant loss cost
escalation due to a variety of factors, including the following:
the increase in frequency and severity of corporate
bankruptcies; the increase in frequency of financial statement
restatements; the sharp rise in market capitalization of
publicly traded companies; and the increase in the number of
initial public offerings, which led to an unprecedented number
of IPO allocation/laddering suits in 2001. In addition,
extensive utilization of multi-year policies during this period
limited AIG’s ability to respond to emerging trends as
rapidly as would otherwise be the case. AIG experienced
significant adverse loss development since 2002 as a result of
these issues. AIG responded to this development with rate
increases and policy form and coverage changes to better contain
future loss costs in this class of business.

In the year-end 2004 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries
responded to the adverse development for D&O and related
management liability classes by increasing the loss development
factor assumptions. The development factors applicable to
accident years 1997 and subsequent were increased by
approximately 5 percent in the year-end 2004 reserve study.
In addition, the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002
and subsequent were increased to take into account the higher
ultimate loss ratios for accident years 2001 and prior. The loss
ratios for the older accident years increased due to the
combination of higher than expected loss development in the year
and the increase in the loss development factor assumptions.

40       AIG

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

For the year-end 2005 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries
responded to the continuing adverse development by further
increasing the loss development factor assumptions. The loss
development factors applicable to 1997 and subsequent accident
years were increased by approximately 4 percent. In
addition, AIG’s actuaries began to give greater weight to
loss development methods for accident years 2002 and 2003, in
order to more fully respond to the recent loss experience.
AIG’s claims staff also conducted a series of

ground-up

claim
projections covering all open claims for this business through
accident year 2004. AIG’s actuaries benchmarked the loss
reserve indications for all accident years through 2004 to these
claim projections.

For the year-end 2006 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries
determined that no significant changes in the assumptions were
required. Prior accident year loss development in 2006 was
favorable by approximately $20 million, an insignificant
amount for these classes. AIG’s actuaries continued to
benchmark the loss reserve indications to the ground up claim
projections provided by AIG claims staff for this class of
business. For the year-end 2006 loss reserve review, the ground
up claim projections included all accident years through 2005.

Loss reserves pertaining to D&O and related management
liability classes of business are included in the Other
liability claims made line of business, as presented in the
table on page 37.

Excess Workers Compensation:

This class of business
experienced significant adverse development in 2005, and a
relatively minor amount of adverse development in 2006. The
adverse development in 2005 related to 2002 and prior accident
years. This adverse development resulted primarily from
significant loss cost increases, primarily attributable to
rapidly increasing medical inflation and advances in medical
care, which increased the cost of covered medical care and
extended the life span of severely injured workers. The effect
of these factors on excess workers compensation claims
experience is leveraged, as frequency is increased by the rising
number of claims that reach the excess layers.

In response to the significantly adverse loss development in
2005, an additional study was conducted for the
2005 year-end actuarial reserve analysis for DBG pertaining
to the selection of loss development factors for this class of
business. Claims for excess workers compensation exhibit an
exceptionally long-tail of loss development, running for decades
from the date the loss is incurred. Thus, the adequacy of loss
reserves for this class is sensitive to the estimated loss
development factors, as such factors may be applied to many
years of loss experience. In order to better estimate the tail
development for this class, AIG claims staff conducted a
claim-by-claim projection of the expected ultimate paid loss for
each open claim for 1998 and prior accident years as these are
the primary years from which the tail factors are derived. The
objective of the study was to provide a benchmark against which
loss development factors in the tail could be evaluated. The
resulting loss development factors utilized by the actuaries in
the year-end 2005 study reflected an increase of approximately
18 percent from the factors used in the prior year study
without the benefit of the claims benchmark. In addition, the
loss cost trend assumption for excess workers compensation was
increased from approximately 2.5 percent to 6 percent
for the 2005 study.

For the year-end 2006 loss reserve review, AIG claims staff
updated the claim-by-claim projection for each open claim for
accident years 1999 and prior. These updated claims projections
were utilized by the actuaries as a benchmark for loss
development factors in the year-end 2006 study. AIG’s
actuaries determined that no significant changes in the
assumptions were required. Prior accident year development in
2006 was adverse by approximately $70 million, a relatively
minor amount for this class.

Overview of Loss Reserving
Process

The General Insurance loss reserves can generally be categorized
into two distinct groups. One group is short-tail classes of
business consisting principally of property, personal lines and
certain casualty classes. The other group is long-tail casualty
classes of business which includes excess and umbrella
liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice,
workers compensation, general liability, products liability, and
related classes.

Short-Tail Reserves

For operations writing short-tail coverages, such as property
coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserves is
generally geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve for
the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an expected
loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR reserve
required for a class of property business might be expected to
approximate 20 percent of the latest year’s earned
premiums, and this level of reserve would generally be
maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current
quarter. The 20 percent factor would be adjusted to reflect
changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known exposure
to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular
class of business.

Long-Tail Reserves

Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses)
for long-tail casualty classes of business is a complex process
and depends on a number of factors, including the class and
volume of business involved. Experience in the more recent
accident years of long-tail casualty classes of business shows
limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a
relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims
and expenses and an even smaller percentage would be net losses
paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high
proportion of net losses.

AIG’s carried net long-tail loss reserves are tested using
loss trend factors that AIG considers appropriate for each class
of business. A variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is
normally employed to estimate net losses for long-tail casualty
classes of businesses. These methods ordinarily involve the use
of loss trend factors intended to reflect the annual growth in
loss costs from one accident year to the next. For the majority
of long-tail casualty classes of business, net loss trend
factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect
many items

Operations

Continued

including changes in claims handling, exposure and policy forms,
current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social
inflation and increases in litigation and awards. These factors
are periodically reviewed and adjusted, as appropriate, to
reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss
experience. Thus, many factors are implicitly considered in
estimating the year to year growth in loss costs.

A number of actuarial assumptions are generally made in the
review of reserves for each class of business. For longer tail
classes of business, actuarial assumptions generally are made
with respect to the following:

•

Loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss
    ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss
    ratio for prior accident years.

•

Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year (i.e.,
    accident year 2006 for the year-end 2006 loss reserve analysis)
    and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest
    accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects the
    projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the
    loss trend (see above) and the effect of rate changes and other
    quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. For low-frequency,
    high-severity classes such as excess casualty, expected loss
    ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent
    accident years.

•

Loss development factors which are used to project the reported
    losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. Generally,
    the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident
    years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development
    factors for the subsequent accident years.

AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its
many General Insurance classes of business. The overall change
in AIG’s loss reserves is based on the sum of these classes
of business changes. For most long-tail classes of business, the
process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves
determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of
coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current
quarter’s net earned premium for that class of coverage to
determine the current accident quarter’s total estimated
net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss reserves
for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between
the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as described
above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter.
Also any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident
years, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss
reserve for the current quarter.

Details of the Loss Reserving
Process

The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class
of business is based on a variety of factors. These include, but
are not limited to, the following considerations: prior accident
year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; changes in
coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; and actual and
anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such
as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment.
The current loss ratio for each class of business reflects input
from actuarial, underwriting and claims staff and is intended to
represent management’s best estimate of the current loss
ratio after reflecting all of the factors described above. At
the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss
ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based
thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of
the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes
achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of
business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect
the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially
determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio
for current business is changed to reflect the revised
assumptions.

A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is completed in the
fourth quarter of each year for each AIG general insurance
subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each
class of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist of
hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of these reviews is
to confirm the appropriateness of the reserves carried by each
of the individual subsidiaries, and therefore of AIG’s
overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for each class of
business is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most
familiar with that class of business. In completing these
detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are required
to make numerous assumptions, including the selection of loss
development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also
required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial
methods to employ for each business class. Additionally, they
must determine the appropriate segmentation of data from which
the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested. In
the course of these detailed reserve reviews a point estimate of
the loss reserve is determined. The sum of these point estimates
for each class of business for each subsidiary provides an
overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that
subsidiary. The ultimate process by which the actual carried
reserves are determined considers both the actuarial point
estimate and numerous other internal and external factors
including a qualitative assessment of inflation and other
economic conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in
the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment,
underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims
handling. Loss reserve development can also be affected by
commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements.

Actuarial Methods for Major Classes of Business

In testing the reserves for each class of business, a
determination is made by AIG’s actuaries as to the most
appropriate actuarial methods. This determination is based on a
variety of factors including the nature of the claims associated
with the class of business, such as frequency or severity. Other
factors considered include the loss development characteristics
associated with the claims, the volume of claim data available
for the applicable class, and the applicability of various
actuarial methods to the class. In addition to determining the
actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss
reserve groupings of data. For example, AIG writes a great
number of unique subclasses of professional liability. For
pricing or other purposes, it is appropriate to evaluate the
profitability of each subclass individually. However, for
purposes of estimating the loss reserves for professional
liability, it is appropriate to combine the subclasses

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

into larger groups. The greater degree of credibility in the
claims experience of the larger groups may outweigh the greater
degree of homogeneity of the individual subclasses. This
determination of data segmentation and actuarial methods is
carefully considered for each class of business. The
segmentation and actuarial methods chosen are those which
together are expected to produce the most accurate estimate of
the loss reserves.

Actuarial methods used by AIG for most long-tail casualty
classes of business include loss development methods and
expected loss ratio methods, including “Bornhuetter
Ferguson” methods described below. Other methods considered
include frequency/severity methods, although these are generally
used by AIG more for pricing analysis than for loss reserve
analysis. Loss development methods utilize the actual loss
development patterns from prior accident years to project the
reported losses to an ultimate basis for subsequent accident
years. Loss development methods generally are most appropriate
for classes of business which exhibit a stable pattern of loss
development from one accident year to the next, and for which
the components of the classes have similar development
characteristics. For example, property exposures would generally
not be combined into the same class as casualty exposures, and
primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into
the same class as excess casualty exposures. Expected loss ratio
methods are generally utilized by AIG where the reported loss
data lacks sufficient credibility to utilize loss development
methods, such as for new classes of business or for long-tail
classes at early stages of loss development.

Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an
expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the class of
business to determine the loss reserves. For example, an
expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned
premium base of $10 million for a class of business would
generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million.
Subtracting any reported paid losses and loss expense would
result in the indicated loss reserve for this class.
“Bornhuetter Ferguson” methods are expected loss ratio
methods for which the expected loss ratio is applied only to the
expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a
long-tail class of business for which only 10 percent of
the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the
accident year, the expected loss ratio would be applied to the
90 percent of the losses still unreported. The actual
reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added
to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident
year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss expenses
would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example
above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be
multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent
would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million
resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million.
Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total
ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million,
the ultimate loss estimate under the “Bornhuetter
Ferguson” method would be $7.3 million versus the
$7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method
described above. Thus, the “Bornhuetter Ferguson”
method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience
to date for the class of business. Loss development methods
generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience
to date. In the example above, loss development methods would
typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of
$10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million
would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the
ultimate losses.

A key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond
quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the class of
business. Therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly
deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives
full credibility to the changing experience. Expected loss ratio
methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would
continue to give more weight to the expected loss ratio, until
enough evidence emerged for the expected loss ratio to be
modified to reflect the changing loss experience. On the other
hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of
overreacting to changes in reported losses if in fact the loss
experience is not credible. For example, the presence or absence
of large losses at the early stages of loss development could
cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable
or unfavorable experience by assuming it will continue at later
stages of development. In these instances, expected loss ratio
methods such as “Bornhuetter Ferguson” have the
advantage of properly recognizing large losses without
extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported
portion of the losses for the accident year. AIG’s loss
reserve reviews for long-tail classes typically utilize a
combination of both loss development and expected loss ratio
methods. Loss development methods are generally given more
weight for accident years and classes of business where the loss
experience is highly credible. Expected loss ratio methods are
given more weight where the reported loss experience is less
credible, or is driven more by large losses. Expected loss ratio
methods require sufficient information to determine the
appropriate expected loss ratio. This information generally
includes the actual loss ratios for prior accident years, and
rate changes as well as underwriting or other changes which
would affect the loss ratio. Further, an estimate of the loss
cost trend or loss ratio trend is required in order to allow for
the effect of inflation and other factors which may increase or
otherwise change the loss costs from one accident year to the
next.

Frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination
of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each
claim for each accident year. Multiplying the estimated ultimate
number of claims for each accident year by the expected average
severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for
the accident year. Frequency/severity methods generally require
a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity
to be predictable. Average severity for subsequent accident
years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual
loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from
prior accident years. Frequency/severity methods have the
advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated
more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. Thus, if
the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these
methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience
than other methods. However, for average severity to be
predictable, the

class of business must consist of homogeneous types of claims
for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are
reasonably consistent. Generally these methods work best for
high frequency, low severity classes of business such as
personal auto. AIG utilizes these methods in pricing subclasses
of professional liability. However, AIG does not generally
utilize frequency/severity methods to test loss reserves, due to
the general nature of AIG’s reserves being applicable to
lower frequency, higher severity commercial classes of business
where average claim severity is volatile.

Excess Casualty:

AIG generally uses a combination of loss
development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess
casualty classes. Expected loss ratio methods are generally
utilized for at least the three latest accident years, due to
the relatively low credibility of the reported losses. The loss
experience is generally reviewed separately for lead umbrella
classes and for other excess classes, due to the relatively
shorter tail for lead umbrella business. Automobile-related
claims are generally reviewed separately from non-auto claims,
due to the shorter tail nature of the automobile related claims.
The expected loss ratios utilized for recent accident years are
based on the projected ultimate loss ratios of prior years,
adjusted for rate changes, estimated loss cost trends and all
other changes that can be quantified. The estimated loss cost
trend utilized in the year-end 2006 reviews averaged
approximately 6 percent for excess casualty classes.
Frequency/severity methods are generally not utilized as the
vast majority of reported claims do not result in a claim
payment. In addition, the average severity varies significantly
from accident year to accident year due to large losses which
characterize this class of business, as well as changing
proportions of claims which do not result in a claim payment.

D&O:

AIG generally utilizes a combination of loss
development methods and expected loss ratio methods for D&O
and related management liability classes of business. Expected
loss ratio methods are given more weight in the two most recent
accident years, whereas loss development methods are given more
weight in more mature accident years. Beginning with the
year-end 2005 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries began to
utilize claim projections provided by AIG claims staff as a
benchmark for determining the indicated ultimate losses for
accident years 2004 and prior. For the year end 2006 loss
reserve review, claims projections for accident years 2005 and
prior were utilized. In prior years, AIG’s actuaries had
utilized these claims projections as a benchmark for
profitability studies for major classes of D&O and related
management liability business. The track record of these claims
projections has indicated a very low margin of error, thus
providing support for their usage as a benchmark in determining
the estimated loss reserve. These classes of business reflect
claims made coverage, and losses are characterized by low
frequency and high severity. Thus, the claim projections can
produce an accurate overall indicator of the ultimate loss
exposure for these classes by identifying and estimating all
large losses. Frequency/severity methods are generally not
utilized for these classes as the overall losses are driven by
large losses more than by claim frequency. Severity trends have
varied significantly from accident year to accident year.

Workers Compensation:

AIG generally utilizes loss
development methods for all but the most recent accident year.
Expected loss ratio methods generally are given significant
weight only in the most recent accident year. Workers
compensation claims are generally characterized by high
frequency, low severity, and relatively consistent loss
development from one accident year to the next. AIG is a leading
writer of workers compensation, and thus has sufficient volume
of claims experience to utilize development methods. AIG does
not believe frequency/severity methods are as appropriate, due
to significant growth and changes in AIG’s workers
compensation business over the years. AIG generally segregates
California business from other business in evaluating workers
compensation reserves. Certain classes of workers compensation,
such as construction, are also evaluated separately.
Additionally, AIG writes a number of very large accounts which
include workers compensation coverage. These accounts are
generally priced by AIG actuaries, and to the extent
appropriate, the indicated losses based on the pricing analysis
may be utilized to record the initial estimated loss reserves
for these accounts.

Excess Workers Compensation:

AIG generally utilizes a
combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio
methods. Loss development methods are given the greater weight
for mature accident years such as 2000 and prior. Expected loss
ratio methods are given the greater weight for the more recent
accident years. Excess workers compensation is an extremely
long-tail class of business, with loss emergence extending for
decades. Therefore there is limited credibility in the reported
losses for many of the more recent accident years. Beginning
with the year-end 2005 loss reserve review, AIG’s actuaries
began to utilize claims projections provided by AIG claims staff
to help determine the loss development factors for this class of
business.

General Liability:

AIG generally uses a combination of
loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for
primary general liability or products liability classes. For
certain classes of business with sufficient loss volume, loss
development methods may be given significant weight for all but
the most recent one or two accident years, whereas for smaller
or more volatile classes of business, loss development methods
may be given limited weight for the five or more most recent
accident years. Expected loss ratio methods would be utilized
for the more recent accident years for these classes. The loss
experience for primary general liability business is generally
reviewed at a level that is believed to provide the most
appropriate data for reserve analysis. For example, primary
claims made business is generally segregated from business
written on an occurrence policy form. Additionally, certain
subclasses, such as construction, are generally reviewed
separately from business in other subclasses. Due to the fairly
long-tail nature of general liability business, and the many
subclasses that are reviewed individually, there is less
credibility in the reported losses and increased reliance on
expected loss ratio methods. AIG’s actuaries generally do
not

44       AIG

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

utilize frequency/severity methods to test reserves for this
business, due to significant changes and growth in AIG’s
general liability and products liability business over the years.

Commercial Automobile Liability:

AIG generally utilizes
loss development methods for all but the most recent accident
year for commercial automobile classes of business. Expected
loss ratio methods are generally given significant weight only
in the most recent accident year. Frequency/severity methods are
generally not utilized due to significant changes and growth in
this business over the years.

Healthcare:

AIG generally uses a combination of loss
development methods and expected loss ratio methods for
healthcare classes of business. The largest component of the
healthcare business consists of coverage written for hospitals
and other healthcare facilities. Reserves for excess coverage
are tested separately from those for primary coverage. For
primary coverages, loss development methods are generally given
the majority of the weight for all but the latest three accident
years, and are given some weight for all years other than the
latest accident year. For excess coverages, expected loss
methods are generally given all the weight for the latest three
accident years, and are also given considerable weight for
accident years prior to the latest three years. For other
classes of healthcare coverage, an analogous weighting between
loss development and expected loss ratio methods is utilized.
The weights assigned to each method are those which are believed
to result in the best combination of responsiveness and
stability. Frequency/severity methods are sometimes utilized for
pricing certain healthcare accounts or business. However, in
testing loss reserves the business is generally combined into
larger groupings to enhance the credibility of the loss
experience. The frequency/severity methods that are applicable
in pricing may not be appropriate for reserve testing and thus
frequency/severity methods are not generally employed in
AIG’s healthcare reserve analyses.

Professional Liability:

AIG generally uses a combination
of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for
professional liability classes of business. Loss development
methods are used for the more mature accident years. Greater
weight is given to expected loss ratio methods in the more
recent accident years. Reserves are tested separately for claims
made classes and classes written on occurrence policy forms.
Further segmentations are made in a manner believed to provide
the most appropriate balance between credibility and homogeneity
of the data. Frequency/severity methods are used in pricing and
profitability analyses for some classes of professional
liability; however, for loss reserve testing, the need to
enhance credibility generally results in classes that are not
sufficiently homogenous to utilize frequency/severity methods.

Aviation:

AIG generally uses a combination of loss
development methods and expected loss ratio methods for aviation
exposures. Aviation claims are not very long-tail in nature;
however, they are driven by claim severity. Thus a combination
of both development and expected loss ratio methods are used for
all but the latest accident year to determine the loss reserves.
Expected loss ratio methods are used to determine the loss
reserves for the latest accident year. Frequency/severity
methods are not employed due to the high severity nature of the
claims and different mix of claims from year to year.

Personal Auto (Domestic):

AIG generally utilizes
frequency/severity methods and loss development methods for
domestic personal auto classes. For many classes of business,
greater reliance is placed on frequency/severity methods as
claim counts emerge quickly for personal auto and allow for more
immediate analysis of resulting loss trends and comparisons to
industry and other diagnostic metrics.

Fidelity/Surety:

AIG generally uses loss development
methods for fidelity exposures for all but the latest accident
year. Expected loss ratio methods are also given weight for the
more recent accident years, and for the latest accident year
they may be given 100 percent weight. For surety exposures,
AIG generally uses the same method as for short-tail classes.

Mortgage Guaranty:

AIG tests mortgage guaranty reserves
using loss development methods, supplemented by an internal
claim analysis by actuaries and staff who specialize in the
mortgage guaranty business. The claim analysis projects ultimate
losses for claims within each of several categories of default
based on actual historical experience and is essentially a
frequency/severity analysis for each category of default.

Short-Tail Classes:

AIG generally uses either loss
development methods or IBNR factor methods to set reserves for
short-tail classes such as property coverages. Where a factor is
used, it generally represents a percent of earned premium or
other exposure measure. The factor is determined based on prior
accident year experience. For example, the IBNR for a class of
property coverage might be expected to approximate
20 percent of the latest year’s earned premium. The
factor is continually reevaluated in light of emerging claim
experience as well as rate changes or other factors that could
affect the adequacy of the IBNR factor being employed.

International:

Business written by AIG’s Foreign
General Insurance sub-segment includes both long-tail and
short-tail classes of business. For long-tail classes of
business, the actuarial methods utilized would be analogous to
those described above. However, the majority of business written
by Foreign General Insurance is short-tail, high frequency and
low severity in nature. For this business, loss development
methods are generally employed to test the loss reserves. AIG
maintains a data base of detailed historical premium and loss
transactions in original currency for business written by
Foreign General Insurance, thereby allowing AIG actuaries to
determine the current reserves without any distortion from
changes in exchange rates over time. In testing the Foreign
General Insurance reserves, AIG’s actuaries segment the
data by region, country or class of business as appropriate to
determine the optimal balance between homogeneity and
credibility.

Loss Adjustment Expenses:

AIG determines reserves for
legal defense and cost containment loss adjustment expenses for
each

class of business by one or more actuarial methods. The methods
generally include development methods analogous to those
described for loss development methods. The developments could
be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the
ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both.
Other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate
ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual
experience from prior accident years or from similar classes of
business. AIG generally determines reserves for adjuster loss
adjustment expenses based on calendar year ratios of adjuster
expenses paid to losses paid for the particular class of
business. AIG generally determines reserves for other
unallocated loss adjustment expenses based on the ratio of the
calendar year expenses paid to overall losses paid. This
determination is generally done for all classes of business
combined, and reflects costs of home office claim overhead as a
percent of losses paid.

Catastrophes:

Special analyses are conducted by AIG in
response to major catastrophes in order to estimate AIG’s
gross and net loss and loss expense liability from the event.
These analyses may include a combination of approaches,
including modeling estimates, ground up claim analysis, loss
evaluation reports from

on-site

field
adjusters, and market share estimates.

AIG’s loss reserve analyses do not calculate a range of
loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss
reserves from AIG’s General Insurance business relates to
longer-tail casualty classes of business driven by severity
rather than frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and
D&O, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would
not be meaningful. Using the reserving methodologies described
above, AIG’s actuaries determine their best estimate of the
required reserve and advise Management of that amount. AIG then
adjusts its aggregate carried reserves as necessary so that the
actual carried reserves as of December 31 reflect this best
estimate.

Volatility of Reserve Estimates and Sensitivity Analyses

As described above, AIG uses numerous assumptions in determining
its best estimate of reserves for each class of business. The
importance of any specific assumption can vary by both class of
business and accident year. If actual experience differs from
key assumptions used in establishing reserves, there is
potential for significant variation in the development of loss
reserves, particularly for long-tail casualty classes of
business such as excess casualty, D&O or workers
compensation. Set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that
estimates the effect on the loss reserve position of using
alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions
rather than those actually used in determining AIG’s best
estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses for 2006. The
analysis addresses each major class of business for which a
material deviation to AIG’s overall reserve position is
believed reasonably possible, and uses what AIG believes is a
reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each class.
There can be no assurance, however, that actual reserve
development will be consistent with either the original or the
adjusted loss trend or loss development factor assumptions, or
that other assumptions made in the reserving process will not
materially affect reserve development for a particular class of
business.

Excess Casualty:

For the excess casualty class of
business, the assumed loss cost trend was approximately
six percent. After evaluating the historical loss cost
trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in
AIG’s judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss
cost trends applicable to the year-end 2006 loss reserve review
for excess casualty will range from negative four percent to
positive 16 percent, or approximately ten percent lower or
higher than the assumption actually utilized in the year-end
2006 reserve review. A ten percent change in the assumed loss
cost trend for excess casualty would cause approximately a
$1.7 billion increase or a $1.2 billion decrease in
the net loss and loss expense reserve for this class of
business. It should be emphasized that the ten percent
deviations are not considered the highest possible deviations
that might be expected, but rather what is considered by AIG to
reflect a reasonably likely range of potential deviation. Actual
loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for several
years, including amounts below the negative four percent cited
above, whereas actual loss cost trends in the late 1990s ran
well into the double digits for several years, including amounts
greater than the 16 percent cited above. Thus, there can be
no assurance that loss trends will not deviate by more than ten
percent. The loss cost trend assumption is critical for the
excess casualty class of business due the long-tail nature of
the claims and therefore is applied across many accident years.

For the excess casualty class of business, the assumed loss
development factors are also a key assumption. After evaluating
the historical loss development factors from prior accident
years since the early 1990s, in AIG’s judgment, it is
reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will
range from approximately 3.25 percent below those actually
utilized in the year-end 2006 reserve review to approximately
ten percent above those factors actually utilized. If the
loss development factor assumptions were changed by
3.25 percent and ten percent, respectively, the net
loss reserves for the excess casualty class would decrease by
approximately $450 million under the lower assumptions or
increase by approximately $1.25 billion under the higher
assumptions. Generally, actual historical loss development
factors are used to project future loss development. However
there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns
will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate
by more than the amounts illustrated above. Moreover, as excess
casualty is a long-tail class of business, any deviation in loss
cost trends or in loss development factors might not be
discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the
recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident
year. Thus, there is the potential for the reserves with respect
to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by
changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that
were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. These
changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be
attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial
environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting
claims. Thus, there is the potential for

46       AIG

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

variations greater than the amounts cited above, either
positively or negatively.

D&O and Related Management Liability Classes of
Business:

For D&O and related management liability
classes of business, the assumed loss cost trend was
approximately four percent. After evaluating the historical
loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early
1990s, in AIG’s judgment, it is reasonably likely that
actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2006 loss
reserve review for these classes will range from negative
11 percent to positive 19 percent, or approximately 15
percent lower or higher than the assumption actually utilized in
the year-end 2006 reserve review. A 15 percent change in the
assumed loss cost trend for these classes would cause
approximately a $625 million increase or a
$550 million decrease in the net loss and loss expense
reserves for these classes of business. It should be emphasized
that the 15 percent deviations are not considered the highest
possible deviations that might be expected, but rather what is
considered by AIG to reflect a reasonably likely range of
potential deviation. Actual loss cost trends for these classes
in the early 1990s were negative for several years, including
amounts below the negative 11 percent cited above, whereas
actual loss cost trends in the late 1990s ran at nearly
50 percent per year for several years, vastly exceeding the
19 percent figure cited above. Because the D&O class of
business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one
accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an
exceptionally high deviation.

For D&O and related management liability classes of
business, the assumed loss development factors are also an
important assumption but less critical than for excess casualty.
Because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the
loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for
excess casualty. However, the high severity nature of the claims
does create the potential for significant deviations in loss
development patterns from one year to the next. After evaluating
the historical loss development factors for these classes of
business for accident years since the early 1990s, in AIG’s
judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development
factors will range approximately five percent lower or
higher than those factors actually utilized in the year-end 2006
loss reserve review for these classes. If the loss development
factor assumptions were changed by five percent, the net
loss reserves for these classes would be estimated to increase
or decrease by approximately $200 million. As noted above
for excess casualty, actual historical loss development factors
are generally used to project future loss development. However,
there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns
will be the same as in the past, or that they will not deviate
by more than the five percent.

Excess Workers Compensation:

For excess workers
compensation business, loss costs were trended at
six percent per annum. After reviewing actual industry loss
trends for the past ten years, in AIG’s judgment, it is
reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the
year-end 2006 loss reserve review for excess workers
compensation will range five percent lower or higher than
this estimated loss trend. A five percent change in the
assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a $350 million
increase or a $225 million decrease in the net loss
reserves for this business. It should be emphasized that the
actual loss cost trend could vary significantly from this
assumption, and there can be no assurance that actual loss costs
will not deviate, perhaps materially, by greater than
five percent.

For excess workers compensation business, the assumed loss
development factors are a critical assumption. Excess workers
compensation is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a
much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss
development factors for the tail of the loss development. After
evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior
accident years since the 1980s, in AIG’s judgment, it is
reasonably likely that actual loss development factors will
range approximately 15 percent lower or higher than those
factors actually utilized in the year-end 2006 loss reserve
review for excess workers compensation. If the loss development
factor assumptions were changed by 15 percent, the net loss
reserves for excess workers compensation would increase or
decrease by approximately $600 million. Given the exceptionally
long-tail for this class of business, there is the potential for
actual deviations in the loss development tail to exceed the
deviations assumed, perhaps materially.

Primary Workers Compensation:

For primary workers
compensation, the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to
be material with respect to AIG’s loss reserves. This is
primarily because AIG’s actuaries are generally able to use
loss development projections for all but the most recent
accident year’s reserves, so there is limited need to rely
on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers compensation
business.

However, for primary workers compensation business the loss
development factor assumptions are important. Generally,
AIG’s actual historical workers compensation loss
development factors would be expected to provide a reasonably
accurate predictor of future loss development. However, workers
compensation is a long-tail class of business, and AIG’s
business reflects a very significant volume of losses
particularly in recent accident years due to growth of the
business. After evaluating the actual historical loss
developments since the 1980s for this business, in AIG’s
judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development
factors will fall within the range of approximately
2.75 percent below to 7.5 percent above those actually
utilized in the year-end 2006 loss reserve review. If the loss
development factor assumptions were changed by 2.75 percent
and 7.5 percent, respectively, the net loss reserves for
workers compensation would decrease or increase by approximately
$525 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. It should be noted
that loss emergence in 2006 for this class was higher than
historical averages, resulting in an increase in loss reserves
for prior accident years. However, it is too soon to ascertain
if this increased emergence represents a new trend in the
pattern of loss development. For this class of business, there
can be no assurance that actual deviations from the expected
loss development factors will not exceed the deviations assumed,
perhaps materially.

Other Casualty Classes of Business:

For casualty business
other than the classes discussed above, there is generally some
potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss
development factor assumptions. However, the effect of such
deviations is expected to be less material when compared to the
effect on the classes cited above.

Asbestos and Environmental
Reserves

The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and
environmental claims on insurance policies written many years
ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims
due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial
interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have
tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such
policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The
insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation
over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted
with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these
exposures.

AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries and damages
from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental
pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of
hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as
environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries
from asbestos.

The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims
emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years.
Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute
exclusion for pollution-related damage and an absolute asbestos
exclusion was also implemented. The current environmental
policies that AIG underwrites on a claims-made basis have been
excluded from the analysis herein.

The majority of AIG’s exposures for asbestos and
environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary
coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same
manner as indemnity amounts. That is, litigation expenses are
included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs.
Individual significant claim liabilities, where future
litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on
a case-by-case basis.

Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is
a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental
claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving
techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year
loss development factors. The methods used to determine asbestos
and environmental loss estimates and to establish the resulting
reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management.

Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the
asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the
inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations
which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage.
The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and
there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop
in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup
costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as
allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible
parties and the government’s refusal to release parties.

Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the
future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the
same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such
future development will be affected by the extent to which
courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the
scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by
the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and
liability issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves
develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse
effect on AIG’s future results of operations.

With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG
established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and
environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all
such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate
these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a
claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of
individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder
presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally
evaluates exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, considering a
variety of factors such as known facts, current law,
jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are unique
to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be supplemented
by subjective considerations, including management judgment.
Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually utilizing the
aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the
current information.

In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental
claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early resolution
with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its
exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG
attempts to mitigate its known long-tail environmental exposures
by utilizing a combination of proactive claim-resolution
techniques, including policy buybacks, complete environmental
releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated,
litigation.

With respect to asbestos claims handling, AIG’s specialized
claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive
handling, supervision and resolution of asbestos cases. Thus,
while AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and
major manufacturers (Tier One), its claims staff continues
to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims
involving accounts with products containing asbestos
(Tier Two), products containing small amounts of asbestos,
companies in the distribution process, and parties with remote,
ill-defined involvement in asbestos (Tiers Three and Four).
Through its commitment to appropriate staffing, training, and
management oversight of asbestos cases, AIG mitigates to the
extent possible its exposure to these claims.

To determine the appropriate loss reserve as of
December 31, 2006 for its asbestos and environmental
exposures, AIG performed a series of top-down and

ground-up

reserve
analyses. In order to ensure it had the most comprehensive
analysis possible, AIG engaged a third-party actuary to assist
in a review of these exposures, including

ground-up

estimates for
both asbestos reserves and environmental reserves consistent
with the 2005 review. Prior to 2005, AIG’s reserve analyses
for asbestos and environmental exposures was focused around a
report year projection of aggregate losses for both asbestos and
environmental reserves. Additional tests such as market share
analyses were also performed.

Ground-up

analyses take
into account policy-

48       AIG

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

holder-specific and claim-specific information that has been
gathered over many years from a variety of sources.

Ground-up

studies can
thus more accurately assess the exposure to AIG’s layers of
coverage for each policyholder, and hence for all policyholders
in the aggregate, provided a sufficient sample of the
policyholders can be modeled in this manner.

In order to ensure its

ground-up

analyses were
comprehensive, AIG staff produced in the 2006 analyses the
information required at policy and claim level detail for over
1,000 asbestos defendants and nearly 1,000 environmental
defendants. This represented over 95 percent of all
accounts for which AIG had received any claim notice of any
amount pertaining to asbestos or environmental exposure. AIG did
not set any minimum thresholds, such as amount of case reserve
outstanding, or paid losses to date, that would have served to
reduce the sample size and hence the comprehensiveness of the

ground-up

analysis. The
results of the

ground-up

analysis for
each significant account were examined by AIG’s claims
staff for reasonableness, for consistency with policy coverage
terms, and any claim settlement terms applicable. Adjustments
were incorporated accordingly. The results from the universe of
modeled accounts, which as noted above reflects the vast
majority of AIG’s known exposures, were then utilized to
estimate the ultimate losses from accounts or exposures that
could not be modeled and to determine the appropriate provision
for all unreported claims.

AIG conducted a comprehensive analysis of reinsurance
recoverability to establish the appropriate asbestos and
environmental reserve net of reinsurance. AIG determined the
amount of reinsurance that would be ceded to insolvent
reinsurers or to commuted reinsurance contracts for both
reported claims and for IBNR. These amounts were then deducted
from the indicated amount of reinsurance recoverable. The
year-end 2006 analysis reflected an update to the comprehensive
analysis of reinsurance recoverability that was first completed
in 2005. All asbestos accounts for which there was a significant
change in estimated losses in the 2006 review were analyzed to
determine the appropriate reserve net of reinsurance.

AIG also completed a top-down report year projection of its
indicated asbestos and environmental loss reserves. These
projections consist of a series of tests performed separately
for asbestos and for environmental exposures.

For asbestos, these tests project the expected losses to be
reported over the next twenty years, i.e., from 2007 through
2026, based on the actual losses reported through 2006 and the
expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios
were tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more
optimistic to more conservative. In the first scenario, all
carried asbestos case reserves are assumed to be within ten
percent of their ultimate settlement value. The second scenario
relies on an actuarial projection of report year development for
asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate
case reserve adequacy as of year-end 2006. The third scenario
relies on an actuarial projection of report year claims for
asbestos but reflects claims reported from 1989 to the present
to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year-end 2006. Based on
the results of the prior report years for each of the three
scenarios described above, the report year approach then
projects forward to the year 2026 the expected future report
year losses, based on AIG’s estimate of reasonable loss
trend assumptions. These calculations are performed on losses
gross of reinsurance. The IBNR (including a provision for
development of reported claims) on a net basis is based on
applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to
gross losses for future loss emergence.

For environmental claims, an analogous series of frequency/
severity tests are produced. Environmental claims from future
report years, (i.e., IBNR) are projected out ten years, i.e.,
through the year 2016.

At year-end 2006, AIG considered a number of factors and recent
experience in addition to the results of the respective top-down
and

ground-up

analyses
performed for asbestos and environmental reserves. AIG
considered the significant uncertainty that remains as to
AIG’s ultimate liability relating to asbestos and
environmental claims. This uncertainty is due to several factors
including:

•

The long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease
    manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of
    multiple policy periods for individual claims;

•

The increase in the volume of claims by currently unimpaired
    plaintiffs;

•

Claims filed under the non-aggregate premises or operations
    section of general liability policies;

•

The number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the
    effect of prepackaged bankruptcies;

•

Diverging legal interpretations; and

•

With respect to environmental claims, the difficulty in
    estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various
    parties.

After carefully considering the results of the

ground-up

analysis,
which AIG updates on an annual basis, as well as all of the
above factors, including the recent report year experience, AIG
determined its best estimate was to recognize an increase of
$256 million in its carried net asbestos reserves, and a
decrease of $58 million in its carried net environmental
reserves at December 31, 2006. The corresponding changes in
gross reserves were an increase of approximately $570 million
for asbestos and a decrease of approximately $230 million
for environmental, respectively. A minor amount of additional
incurred loss emergence pertaining to asbestos was reflected in
2006, primarily attributable to the general reinsurance
operations of Transatlantic. The majority of the increase in
asbestos reserves resulting from the 2006 review is attributable
to higher than expected emergence of claims pertaining to new
asbestos policy exposures. A significant portion of this
increase pertains to higher layers of excess coverage for
certain major asbestos defendants on business written by DBG.
Approximately $80 million of the overall $256 million
net asbestos reserve increase is attributable to business
written by Foreign General, approximately $30 million of
which is in turn ceded to DBG. In 2006, Foreign General enhanced
its capability to identify asbestos exposures, resulting in the
identification of additional asbestos defendants in 2006, as
well as higher layers of exposure for certain existing
defendants. As described above, the ground up analysis as of
2006 now models over 1,000 asbestos defendants and over 95
percent of all known reported asbestos claims.

The decrease in environmental reserves resulting from the 2006
review is primarily attributable to favorable loss trends in
recent report years. These favorable trends resulted in a
reduced expectation of unreported claims, i.e., IBNR, for future
report years.

A summary of reserve activity,
including estimates for applicable IBNR, relating to asbestos
and environmental claims separately and combined at
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 appears in the table
below. The vast majority of such claims arise from policies
written in 1984 and prior years. The current environmental
policies that AIG underwrites on a claims-made basis have been
excluded from the table below.

As indicated in the table above, asbestos loss payments
increased significantly in 2006 compared to the prior years,
primarily as a result of payments pertaining to settlements that
had been negotiated in earlier periods.

The gross and net IBNR included in the
reserve for losses and loss expenses, relating to asbestos and

The opened claims count increased substantially during 2005
    compared to 2004 because a court ruling led AIG to report
    separate opened claims for previously pending cases relating to
    alleged MTBE exposures that AIG previously had counted in the
    aggregate as only a single claim on the assumption that the
    cases would be consolidated into a single federal court

Survival Ratios — Asbestos and Environmental

The following table presents AIG’s survival ratios for
asbestos and environmental claims for year-end 2006, 2005 and
2004. The survival ratio is derived by dividing the year end
carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most
recent calendar years for these claims. Therefore, the survival
ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it
would be before the current ending loss reserves for these
claims would be paid off using recent year average payments. The
December 31, 2006 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at
December 31, 2005 because the more recent periods included
in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments. Many
factors, such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of
business and level of coverage provided, have a significant
effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and
payments and the resultant survival ratio. Thus, caution should
be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for
these claims based simply on this survival ratio.

AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos
and environmental claims, separately and combined were based
upon a three-year average payment. These ratios for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as
follows:

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Life Insurance & Retirement Service revenues increased
$2.8 billion in 2006, to $50.2 billion. The increased
revenues reflect growth in the underlying global Life
Insurance & Retirement Services businesses. Revenues
include the positive effect of out of period adjustments related
to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment
trusts totaling $240 million in 2006. Operating income grew
by $1.1 billion from 2005, to $10.0 billion,
reflecting higher revenues and out of period reductions of
policy benefits expense of $163 million resulting from
corrections of par policyholder dividend reserves and
allocations between participating and non-participating
accounts, both of which were related to remediation efforts. Net
investment income increased $1.3 billion, reflecting growth
in the underlying global business and the related increased
level of invested assets. Realized capital gains increased
$246 million in 2006 compared to 2005. In addition,
operating income in 2006 includes charges of $125 million
for the adverse Superior National arbitration ruling (see Note
12(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and
$66 million related to the exiting of the domestic
financial institutions credit life business.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Life Insurance & Retirement Services revenues, including
realized capital losses of $158 million, grew
$4.0 billion to $47.4 billion. The increase in
revenues reflects growth in the underlying global Life
Insurance & Retirement Services businesses. Operating
income grew $979 million in 2005, reflecting growth in both
domestic and overseas operations. In 2005, the Domestic Life
Insurance reporting unit performed well in its life insurance
and payout annuities businesses, but results were offset by
restructuring efforts in both home services and group
life/health. The Domestic Retirement Services reporting unit
faced a challenging environment in 2005, resulting in lower
deposits and increased surrender rates. The Foreign Life
Insurance & Retirement Services reporting unit had
improved operating income in 2005 helped by higher net
investment income, lower acquisition and operating expenses in
life insurance and strong growth in annuities, partially offset
by lower realized capital gains and higher incurred policy
benefit costs.

Japan and Other

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Total revenues for Japan and Other increased $743 million
in 2006, to $16.0 billion, compared to 2005. Operating
income grew $773 million, due to growth in the underlying
retirement services businesses and realized capital gains of
$406 million. The 2006 results for the reporting unit were
negatively affected by the weakening of the Japanese Yen against
the U.S. dollar during 2006. In addition, operating income
was negatively affected by the continued runoff of the older,
higher margin in-force business of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison
Life.

Life insurance GAAP premiums declined in 2006 compared to 2005
primarily due to the effect of foreign exchange. Foreign
exchange negatively affected GAAP premiums by approximately
$250 million, most notably as a result of the weakening in
the Japanese Yen. Life insurance operating income grew
$445 million, primarily due to an increase of
$368 million of realized capital gains. Life insurance
growth improved due to an increase in single premium life
insurance sales in Japan as a result of further bank
deregulation effective in December 2005. The expansion of the
bank distribution platform for single premium life insurance
products adds to the existing multiple distribution platforms in
Japan, where AIG remains the leading foreign insurance provider.

Personal accident revenues grew $258 million or
7 percent resulting in operating income growth of
$71 million or 7 percent. Personal accident operating
income includes the effect of higher terminations of certain
accident and health policies in Japan which increased expenses
by $54 million in 2006. The higher terminations are a
result of a change in the Japanese tax regulations that reduced
the tax deduction for premiums. AIG’s Japanese operations
have experienced lower sales and higher terminations of these
contracts. DAC related to these accident

and health policies in force at December 31, 2006 totaled
$214 million. In response to the tax law change, AIG has
introduced new products, both life and health, to meet the needs
of clients in that market. AIG continues to believe that the
effect of future policy terminations will not be material to
AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

Revenues from group products increased in 2006 by
$320 million, to $2.3 billion, resulting in an
increase in operating income of $81 million to
$272 million. Fixed annuity reserves continued to grow due
to positive net flows, but demand for U.S. dollar fixed
annuities has slowed due to a weaker Japanese Yen. The
individual fixed annuity revenues grew $302 million to
$2.3 billion resulting in an increase in operating income
of $163 million to $553 million. Growth in variable
annuity deposits has accelerated compared to 2005 due to new
product offerings and stronger equity markets, resulting in
higher fees and policy charges included in GAAP premiums.
Variable annuity revenues declined in 2006 compared to 2005 due
to lower policyholder trading gains which comprise the entirety
of variable annuity net investment income. Policyholder trading
gains are offset by an equal increase in policy benefits
expense, as all investment returns for these variable annuities
accrue to the benefit of the policyholder.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

In 2005, total revenues for the Japan and Other reporting unit
grew $3.1 billion to $15.3 billion, including
policyholder trading gains of $1.3 billion. Operating
income grew $566 million to $3.0 billion. Compared to
2004, results reported in U.S. dollars were negatively affected
by foreign exchange, particularly the weakening of the Japanese
Yen to the U.S. dollar. In addition, Japan and Other operating
income was negatively affected by the runoff of older higher
margin in-force business of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life.
Life insurance operating income grew primarily due to lower
realized capital losses and higher GAAP premiums. Personal
accident operating income continued to report stable profit
margins and grew $119 million to $1.05 billion. Group
operating income grew to $191 million on strong growth in
ALICO operations outside of Japan. Individual fixed annuities
operating income grew to $390 million, primarily from
strong growth of net flows that increased underlying reserves in
Japan. Individual fixed annuity operating income for 2005
included a charge of $47 million related to the unwinding
of certain businesses in Chile that were sold in 2006.
Individual variable annuities operating income grew to
$47 million on higher average reserves. Net investment
income for individual variable annuities grew to
$767 million in 2005 and represents policyholder trading
gains (losses) that are offset by an equal amount in
incurred policy losses and benefits.

Asia

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Revenues for Asia grew $1.9 billion in 2006 to
$17.9 billion. Operating income grew $774 million, to
$3.1 billion, including realized capital gains of
$301 million. Revenues and operating income in 2006 include
$208 million and $137 million, respectively, from out
of period adjustments related to certain investments in unit
trusts. GAAP premiums grew 4 percent in 2006 compared to
2005. The GAAP premium growth rate was negatively affected by
the continuing trend towards investment-oriented products in
Asia as only a portion of policy charges collected from the
customers are reported as GAAP premiums. AIG’s Life
Insurance operations in Asia have responded to this trend by
offering a wide array of investment linked products, with
multiple fund choices but with minimal investment guarantees.

Operating income benefited in 2006 from an out of period
reduction in participating policyholder dividend reserves of
$163 million, primarily as a result of tax remediation
adjustments and a correction to expense allocations between
participating and non-participating accounts. Certain
participating policyholder dividend reserves are determined on
an after tax basis and as a result any change in the local tax
provision will have a partially offsetting, but not equal,
effect on participating policyholder dividend reserves. The
amount of the offsetting effect depends on the level of
participation required by law or regulation in that specific
country or by the participation level provided for in the
underlying contracts. In 2005, operating income for Asia
included a charge of $137 million related to an increase in
participating policyholder dividends as a result of the
settlement of a tax dispute in Singapore. Life insurance
revenues grew $1.4 billion to $15.4 billion in 2006,
including realized capital gains of $258 million and
policyholder trading gains of $552 million, helped by
strong growth in investment linked products throughout Asia.
Operating income grew $609 million, including adjustments
in 2006 and 2005 for participating policyholder dividend
reserves mentioned above. Operating income includes the Life
Insurance & Retirement Services segment’s equal
share of the results of AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan), which
amounted to a loss of $47 million in 2006 compared to a
gain of $26 million in 2005. Personal accident revenues
grew 28 percent to $1.7 billion, reflecting increased
focus on risk based accident and health products. The growth in
revenues resulted in operating income of $337 million for
the year, an increase of 40 percent over 2005. Group
products revenues increased $72 million from 2005, to
$627 million, resulting in operating income growth of
$47 million to $178 million.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

In 2005, revenues were essentially unchanged at
$16.0 billion on lower realized capital gains that declined
$372 million, due to lower gains on derivatives that did
not qualify for hedge accounting. Operating income declined in

lower realized capital gains. Personal accident operating income
declined primarily due to realized capital losses in 2005
compared to realized capital gains in 2004. Group products GAAP
premiums dropped in 2005 compared to 2004. 2004 GAAP premiums
included premiums of approximately $640 million from a
single reinsurance transaction involving terminal funding
business, which is offset by a similar increase in benefit
reserves.

2006 and 2005 Comparison

GAAP premiums for Domestic Life Insurance were $5.5 billion
in 2006, a 2 percent increase compared to 2005. Overall,
periodic life insurance sales grew by 16 percent, compared
to 2005, reflecting increased growth from the independent
distribution platform. During the second half of 2006, certain
universal life products were re-priced and underwriting
standards were tightened, which could affect future periodic
life insurance sales. GAAP premiums from AGLA, AIG’s home
service business, declined slightly in 2006 as the reduction of
premium in-force from normal lapses and maturities exceeded
sales growth for the period. GAAP premiums for group life/health
for 2006 declined over the prior year primarily due to
restructuring efforts in certain product lines, including the
financial institutions credit life business and the employer
benefits business. The GAAP premium growth from payout annuities
for 2006 reflects increased sales of single premium annuities
and structured settlements when compared to 2005. At
December 31, 2006, AIG effectively exited the financial
institutions credit business through a third party indemnity
reinsurance agreement. The transaction is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2007, subject to normal closing
requirements, including regulatory approval. GAAP premiums in
2006 related to this business were approximately
$100 million.

Domestic Life Insurance operating income of $917 million
declined by 39 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due to
several significant transactions, including a $125 million
charge resulting from the loss of the Superior National
arbitration. For a further discussion of the Superior National
arbitration see Note 12(c) of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. In addition, Domestic Life operating
income was negatively affected by a $55 million accrual
related to other litigation and a $66 million loss related
to exiting the financial institutions credit business.

Life insurance operating income decreased by $220 million
or 25 percent for 2006 due to a $45 million decrease
in partnership income, $30 million in litigation-related
charges and realized capital losses that offset growth in the
underlying business. Home service operating income was flat
compared with 2005 due to increased net investment income from
partnerships and lower acquisition costs and catastrophe losses,
partially offset by a DAC unlocking charge of $11 million
and higher realized capital losses. Group life/health operating
income for 2006 was lower than 2005 primarily due to the
$125 million Superior National charge and the
$66 million loss associated with the exit from the
financial institutions credit business. The group life/health
lines operating income was also affected by a $25 million
charge for litigation reserves. Payout annuities operating
income declined for 2006 due to lower calls and tenders on fixed
maturity securities. In addition, various methodologies and
assumptions were enhanced for payout annuity reserves, resulting
in a $24 million increase to the payout annuity reserves.
Individual annuities — runoff operating income is down
from 2005 due to the decline in the block of business and the
related DAC unlocking charge of $30 million to reflect
lower in-force amounts.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

The Domestic Life Insurance operations in 2005 had continued
growth in term and universal life sales with good performance
from the independent distribution channels. GAAP premiums for
life insurance grew 12 percent in 2005 reflecting
consistently strong sales from the independent distribution
platform. Payout annuities declined slightly due to the low
interest rate environment and the competitive market conditions
for structured settlement and single premiums individual annuity
business. Home service GAAP premiums were essentially flat in
this slow growth business. The group life/health GAAP premiums
declined by $116 million, or 10 percent, primarily due
to the non-renewal of several accounts where pricing was
unacceptable and loss experience was higher than anticipated.

Domestic Life Insurance operating income of $1.5 billion
increased 46 percent in 2005 resulting from increased
realized capital gains, higher partnership income and growth in
the underlying business compared to 2004. Life insurance
operating income was up 43 percent in 2005 compared to 2004
due in part to growth in the underlying business, improved
mortality results and higher realized capital gains, offset by
higher losses from partnership investments in synthetic fuel
production facilities. Home service operating income declined as
a result of a reduction in premiums in-force and higher
insurance and acquisitions expenses, combined with an increase
in losses related to hurricanes. Group life/health operating
income was affected by the non-renewal of cases where acceptable
margins could not be achieved. Operating income in 2004 includes
a $178 million charge related to a workers compensation
quota share reinsurance agreement with Superior National. In
addition, in 2004, as part of the business review of group
life/health, approximately $68 million was incurred for
reserve strengthening and allowances for receivables. Payout
annuities operating income increased 3 percent as growth in
the business base was offset by higher realized capital losses.
Individual annuities runoff operating income increased in 2005
primarily as a result of lower operating expenses offset by
higher realized capital losses when compared to 2004.

Results

Domestic Retirement Services results,
presented on a sub-product basis for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as
follows:

*

Primarily represents runoff annuity business sold through
    discontinued distribution relationships.

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Domestic Retirement Services total deposits decreased slightly
for 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in total deposits
reflects lower fixed annuity sales that continued to face
increased competition from bank deposit products and money
market funds offering very competitive short-term rates in the
flat yield curve environment. This was partially offset by
substantially higher individual variable annuity sales and group
mutual fund deposits. Individual variable annuity deposits grew
29 percent in 2006 from 2005, reflecting growth in products
with living benefit guarantee features. Group retirement
deposits grew 6 percent in 2006, reflecting 51 percent
growth in group mutual fund sales partially offset by a
1 percent sales drop in annuity deposits. Over time, this
will result in a gradual reduction in overall profit margins of
this business driven by the growth in the lower-margin mutual
fund products relative to the annuity products. Fixed annuity
surrender rates increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to
products coming out of their surrender charge period and the
increased competition from banks. Individual fixed annuity net
flows for 2006 were negative $2.7 billion compared to
positive net flows of $1.3 billion in 2005, reflecting both
the lower deposits and higher surrenders, caused by the flat or
inverted yield curve.

Total domestic retirement service operating income for 2006 of
$2.3 billion increased 7 percent from 2005. Group
retirement products total revenues were flat in 2006 primarily
due to improvements in partnership income and variable annuity
fees being offset by increased capital losses. The flat
revenues, coupled with higher amortization of deferred
acquisition costs related to internal replacements of existing
contracts into new contracts, resulted in a 4 percent
decrease in group retirement operating income. Total revenues
for individual fixed annuities were up 7 percent in 2006
and operating income was up 21 percent primarily driven by
higher partnership and yield enhancement income. Individual
variable annuity total revenues were up 7 percent in 2006,
primarily driven by higher variable annuity fees resulting from
the increase in the equity markets. Offsetting somewhat the
growth in total revenues was an increase in DAC amortization
resulting from increased surrender activity in the first half of
2006, with operating income up 2 percent for the year. In
2006, the individual annuities runoff operating income increased
$15 million even though the underlying reserves decreased.
The higher income in 2006 was primarily due to increased net
spreads as a result of higher investment yields partially offset
by increased realized capital losses and lower volumes due to
the continued runoff of the business.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

The Domestic Retirement Services businesses faced a challenging
environment in 2005, as deposits declined approximately
18 percent from 2004. The decrease in AIG’s individual
variable annuity product sales in 2005 was largely attributable
to significant variable annuity sales declines at several of
AIG’s largest distribution firms due to lackluster equity
markets, more intense industry competition with regard to living
benefit product features and heightened compliance procedures
over selling practices. AIG’s introduction of more
competitive guaranteed minimum withdrawal features was delayed
until late in the fourth quarter of 2005 due to filing delays
associated with the restatements. During 2005, the interest
yield curve flattened and, as a result, competing bank products
such as certificates of deposit and other

money market instruments with shorter durations than AIG’s
individual fixed annuity products became more attractive.

Total Domestic Retirement Services operating income for 2005 of
$2.2 billion increased 5 percent compared to 2004
operating income of $2.1 billion. Total revenues for the
group retirement products increased 5 percent in 2005
compared to 2004 while operating income increased
7 percent, primarily due to higher variable annuity fee
income and lower realized capital losses. Individual fixed
annuity total revenues were up 6 percent in 2005 primarily
due to an increase in net investment income, partially offset by
higher realized capital losses. Operating income for individual
fixed annuities increased primarily due to the increase in net
investment income from growth in average reserves and higher
surrender charges, partially offset by the higher level of
realized capital losses. Individual variable annuities total
revenues were up 9 percent in 2005, primarily driven by
higher variable annuity fees resulting from the increase in the
equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2004 and an increase in
realized capital gains. The 7 percent growth in individual
variable annuities income was consistent with the overall growth
in reserves. In 2005, the individual annuities runoff operating
income increased $22 million even though the underlying
reserves decreased. The higher income in 2005 was due to lower
interest crediting rates and lower DAC amortization due to lower
surrenders.

In 2006, surrender rates increased for individual fixed
annuities, group retirement products and individual variable
annuities. The increase in surrender rate for fixed annuities
continues to be driven by the shape of the yield curve and
general aging of the in-force block; however, less than
20 percent of the individual fixed annuity reserves as of
December 31, 2006 were available to be surrendered without
charge. Surrender rates for group retirement products increased
only slightly as a result of successful retention efforts. In
2006, new products were introduced to retain assets and AIG has
retained or attracted over $1 billion in assets. Individual
variable annuity surrender rates for 2006 primarily reflect
higher shock-lapses that occur following expiration of the
surrender charge period on certain

3-year

and

7-year

contracts,
although the trend moderated during the year. Reflecting a
widespread industry phenomenon, this lapse rate, much of which
was anticipated when the products were issued, has recently been
affected by investor demand to exchange existing policies for
new-generation contracts with living benefits or lower fees. In
addition, the high lapse rates are in part due to the surrenders
within certain acquired blocks of business.

A further increase in the level of surrenders in any of these
businesses or in the individual fixed annuities runoff block
could accelerate the amortization of DAC and negatively affect
fee income earned on assets under management.

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Net investment income increased 7 percent for 2006 compared
to 2005 as income from fixed maturity and equity securities
increased as levels of invested assets grew. Net investment
income in 2006 also included out of period adjustments relating
to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment
trusts of $240 million. Partially offsetting this growth
were lower policyholder trading gains (losses) in 2006. Net
Investment income for certain operations include investments in
structured notes linked to emerging market sovereign debt that
incorporates both interest rate risk and currency risk. In
addition, period to period comparisons of investment income for
some lines of business are affected by yield enhancement
activity, particularly partnership income as shown in the above

AIG generates income tax credits as a result of investing in
synthetic fuel production (synfuels) related to the
investment loss shown in the above table and records those
benefits in its provision for income taxes. The amounts of those
income tax credits were $127 million, $203 million and $160
million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For a further
discussion of the effect of fluctuating domestic crude oil
prices on synfuel tax credits, see Note 12(c) of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

The growth in net investment income in 2005 compared to 2004
reflects growth in general account reserves and surplus for both
Foreign and Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement Services
companies. Also, net investment income was positively affected
by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net
investment income along with the addition of new cash flow from
operations available for investment. The global flattening of
the yield curve put additional pressure on yields and spreads,
which was partially offset with income generated from other
investment sources, including income from partnerships.

The following table summarizes realized
capital gains (losses) by major category for 2006, 2005 and
2004:

*

Net of allocations to participating policyholders of
    $88 million, $109 million and $65 million for
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Realized capital gains (losses) include normal portfolio
transactions as well as derivative gains (losses) for
transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
under FAS 133, transactional foreign exchange gains and
losses and other-than-temporary declines in the value of
investments. Realized capital gains (losses) for derivatives in
Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services are
related primarily to hedging of fixed income instruments
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of
the respective country to such functional currency. The related
currency gain or loss of the available for sale fixed income
instrument is deferred until the date of the sale.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products
arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are
directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business.
Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are
generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period
of the policy. Policy acquisition costs that relate to universal
life and investment-type products, including variable and fixed
annuities (investment-oriented products), are deferred and
amortized, with interest, as appropriate, in relation to the
historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be
realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Total
acquisition costs deferred increased $310 million over 2005
and were generally in line with growth in new business. Total
DAC amortization expense, excluding VOBA, grew $432 million
over 2005 with each year’s amortization expense level at
approximately 14 percent of the opening DAC balance.
Amortization expense includes the effects of current period
realized capital gains and losses for investment type products.
With respect to investment-oriented products, AIG’s policy
is to adjust amortization assumptions for DAC when estimates of
current or future gross profits to be realized from these
contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities sold
domestically (representing the vast majority of AIG’s
variable annuity business), the assumption for the long-term
annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the
determination of DAC amortization is approximately ten percent.
A methodology referred to as “reversion to the mean”
is used to maintain this long-term net growth rate assumption,
while giving consideration to short-term variations in equity
markets. Estimated gross profits include investment income and
gains and losses less interest required on policyholder
reserves, as well as other charges in the contract less actual
mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in the
expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the
effect on the amortization of DAC. The projection of estimated
gross profits requires significant management judgment. The
assumptions with respect to the current and projected gross
profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are adjusted
accordingly.

The following table summarizes the
major components of the changes in DAC and Value of Business
Acquired (VOBA) for 2006 and 2005:

(a)

In 2006, sales inducement assets were reclassified to Other
    assets in the consolidated balance sheet. All periods have been
    adjusted to reflect this reclassification.

(b)

In 2006, all other amortization for Domestic Life Insurance
    & Retirement Services includes $136 million of negative
    amortization related to changes in estimates from conversion of
    actuarial systems, which is substantially offset by related
    adjustments in incurred policy losses and benefits in the
    consolidated statement of income.

AIG’s variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes
in market returns because separate account revenues, primarily
composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management
fees, are a function of asset values.

DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products
as well as retirement services products is reviewed for
recoverability, which involves estimating the future
profitability of current business. This review also involves
significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of
future profitability were to be substantially lower than
estimated, AIG’s results of operations could be
significantly affected in future periods.

Financial Services Operations

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified
activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance.

Financial Services Results

Financial Services results for 2006,
2005 and 2004 were as follows:

(g)

Includes specific reserves recorded during 2006 in the amount
    of $42 million related to two commercial lending
    transactions.

Financial Services operating income decreased in 2006 compared
to 2005 and increased in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to
the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge
accounting under FAS 133. AIG is reinstituting hedge
accounting in the first quarter of 2007 for AIGFP and later in
2007 for the balance of the Financial Services operations.

Aircraft Leasing

AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations
of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new
and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic
airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of
commercial jets for ILFC’s own account, and remarketing and
fleet management services for airlines and financial
institutions. ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily
through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The
composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005
were 5.17 percent and 4.61 percent, respectively. The
composite borrowing rates did not reflect the benefit of
economically hedging ILFC’s floating rate and foreign
currency denominated debt using interest rate and foreign
currency derivatives. These derivatives are effective economic
hedges; however, since hedge accounting under FAS 133 was
not applied, the benefits of using derivatives to hedge these
exposures were not reflected in ILFC’s borrowing rates.

ILFC’s sources of revenue are principally from scheduled
and charter airlines and companies associated with the airline
industry. The airline industry is sensitive to changes in
economic conditions and is cyclical and highly competitive.
Airlines and related companies may be affected by political or
economic instability, terrorist activities, changes in national
policy, competitive pressures on certain air carriers, fuel
prices and shortages, labor stoppages, insurance costs,
recessions, world health issues and other political or economic
events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets.

ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through
nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft
which it would be unable to sell or re-lease at acceptable rates
at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase
aircraft which it would be unable to lease.

ILFC’s revenues and operating income may be adversely
affected by the volatile competitive environment in which its
customers operate. ILFC manages the risk of nonperformance by
its lessees with security deposit requirements, repossession
rights, overhaul requirements and close monitoring of industry
conditions through its marketing force. However, there can be no
assurance that ILFC would be able to successfully manage the
risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in
the airline industry. Approximately 90 percent of
ILFC’s fleet is leased to

non-U.S.

carriers,
and the fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the
airline industry, continues to be in high demand from such
carriers.

ILFC typically contracts to re-lease aircraft before the end of
the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of
the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re-lease such
aircraft within two to six months of its return. As a lessor,
ILFC considers an aircraft “idle” or “off
lease” when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease
agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had one aircraft off
lease at December 31, 2006, and all new aircraft scheduled
for delivery through 2007 have been leased.

Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently
than quarterly, issues affecting ILFC’s fleet, including
events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft
values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary
based on

these events and circumstances in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment related
to its fleet in 2006, 2005 and 2004. ILFC has been able to
re-lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates that
would result in an impairment under FAS 144.

Aircraft Leasing Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

ILFC’s operating income decreased in 2006 compared to 2005
by $40 million, or 6 percent. Rental revenues
increased by $536 million or 16 percent, driven by a
larger aircraft fleet, increased utilization and higher lease
rates. During 2006, ILFC’s fleet subject to operating
leases increased by 78 airplanes to a total of 824. The increase
in rental revenues was offset in part by increases in
depreciation expense and interest expense, charges related to
bankrupt airlines, as well as the settlement of a tax dispute in
Australia related to the restructuring of ownership of aircraft.
Depreciation expense increased by $200 million, or
14 percent, in line with the increase in the size of the
aircraft fleet. Interest expense increased by $317 million,
or 28 percent, driven by rising cost of funds, a weaker
U.S. dollar against the Euro and the British Pound and
additional borrowings funding aircraft purchases. As noted
above, ILFC’s interest expense did not reflect the benefit
of hedging these exposures. Gains or losses on derivatives for
ILFC are reported in AIG’s Other category.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

ILFC’s operating income increased in 2005 compared to 2004
by $37 million, or 6 percent. Rental revenues
increased by $499 million, or 17 percent, driven by a
larger aircraft fleet and increased utilization. During 2005,
ILFC’s fleet subject to operating leases increased by 79
airplanes to a total of 746. The increase in rental revenues was
offset in part by increases in depreciation expense, interest
expense, leasing-related costs and other reserves. Depreciation
expense increased by $111 million, or 9 percent, in
line with the increase in the size of the aircraft fleet.
Interest expense increased by $132 million, or
13 percent, driven by rising cost of funds and additional
borrowings funding aircraft purchases.

Capital Markets

engages as principal in a wide variety of financial
transactions, including standard and customized financial
products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy,
equities and rates. AIGFP also invests in a diversified
portfolio of securities and principal investments and engages in
borrowing activities involving issuing standard and structured
notes and other securities, and entering into GIAs.

As Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation, current
and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis
for predicting future performance. AIG’s Capital Markets
operations derive substantially all their revenues from hedged
financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty
transactions rather than from speculative transactions. AIGFP
also participates as a dealer in a wide variety of financial
derivatives transactions. AIGFP economically hedges the market
risks arising from its transactions, although hedge accounting
under FAS 133 was not being applied during 2006, 2005 and
2004 to any of the derivatives and related assets and
liabilities. Accordingly, revenues and operating income were
exposed to volatility resulting from differences in the timing
of revenue recognition between the derivatives and the hedged
assets and liabilities. Revenues and operating income of the
Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in these
amounts for any given period are also significantly affected by
the number, size and profitability of transactions entered into
by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those
entered into during the prior period. Generally, the realization
of transaction revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is
not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on
AIGFP’s trading transactions is currently reflected in
operating income as the fair values change from period to period.

Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course
of AIGFP operations. Derivatives are recorded at fair value,
determined by reference to the mark to market value of the
derivative or their estimated fair value where market prices are
not readily available. The resulting aggregate unrealized gains
or losses from the derivatives are reflected in the consolidated
income statement. Where AIGFP cannot verify significant model
inputs to observable market data and cannot verify the model
value to market transactions, AIGFP values the contract at the
transaction price at inception and, consequently, records no
initial gain or loss in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No.

02-03,

“Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts
Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy
Trading and Risk Management Activities”
(EITF

02-03).

Such
initial gain or loss is recognized over the life of the
transaction. AIGFP periodically reevaluates its revenue
recognition under
EITF

02-03

based
on the observability of market parameters. The mark to fair
value of derivative transactions is reflected in the
consolidated balance sheet in the captions “Unrealized gain
on swaps, options and forward transactions” and
“Unrealized loss on swaps, options and forward
transactions.” Unrealized gains represent the present value
of the aggregate of each net receivable, by counterparty, and
the unrealized losses represent the present value of the
aggregate of each net payable, by counterparty, as of
December 31, 2006. These amounts will change from one
period to the next due to changes in interest rates, currency
rates, equity and commodity prices and other market variables,
as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the
maturing of existing transactions.

Spread income on investments and borrowings is recorded on an
accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are
classified as securities available for sale and are carried at
fair value with the resulting unrealized gains or losses
reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.
U.S. dollar denominated borrowings are carried at cost,
while borrowings in any currency other than the U.S. dollar
result in unrealized foreign

exchange gains or losses reported in income. AIGFP hedges the
economic exposure on its investments and borrowings on a
portfolio basis using derivatives and other financial
instruments. While these hedges are highly effective economic
hedges, they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
under FAS 133 through 2006. The change in the fair value of
the derivatives used to hedge these economic exposures is
therefore included in Other income, while the offsetting change
in fair value of the hedged investments and borrowings is not
recognized in income. AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting in
the first quarter of 2007 for AIGFP.

To the extent the Financial Services subsidiaries, other than
AIGFP, use derivatives to economically hedge their assets or
liabilities with respect to their future cash flows, and such
hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
FAS 133, the changes in fair value of such derivatives were
recorded in realized capital gains (losses) or other income.
Amounts recorded in realized capital gains (losses) are reported
as part of AIG’s Other category.

Capital Markets Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Capital Markets operating income in 2006 decreased by
$3.53 billion compared to 2005. Improved results, primarily
from increased transaction flow in AIGFP’s credit,
commodity index, energy and equity products, were more than
offset by the loss resulting from the effect of derivatives not
qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133.
This loss was $1.82 billion in 2006 compared to a gain of
$2.01 billion in 2005, a decrease of $3.83 billion. A
large part of the net loss on AIGFP’s derivatives
recognized in 2006 was due to the weakening of the
U.S. dollar, primarily against the British Pound and Euro,
resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the foreign
currency derivatives hedging AIGFP’s available for sale
securities. The majority of the net gain on AIGFP’s
derivatives in 2005 was due to the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar, primarily against the British Pound and Euro,
which increased the fair value of the foreign currency
derivatives hedging available for sale securities. To a lesser
extent, the net gain in 2005 was due to the decrease in
long-term U.S. interest rates, which increased the fair
value of derivatives hedging AIGFP’s assets and liabilities.

Financial market conditions in 2006 were characterized by a
general flattening of interest rate yield curves across fixed
income markets globally, tightening of credit spreads, higher
equity valuations and a weaker U.S. dollar.

The most significant component of Capital Markets operating
expenses is compensation, which was approximately
$544 million, $481 million and $497 million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of compensation
was not affected by gains and losses arising from derivatives
not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133.

AIG elected to early adopt FAS 155, “Accounting for
Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments” (FAS 155), in
2006 and AIGFP elected to apply the fair value option to its
structured notes and other financial liabilities containing
embedded derivatives outstanding as of January 1, 2006. The
cumulative effect of the adoption of FAS 155 on these
instruments at January 1, 2006 was a pre-tax loss of
$29 million. The effect of these hybrid financial
instruments reflected in AIGFP’s operating income in 2006
was a pretax loss of $287 million, largely offset by gains
on economic hedge positions also reflected in AIGFP’s
operating income.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Capital Markets operating income in 2005 increased by
$2 billion compared to 2004, primarily due to a gain
related to derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting
treatment of $2.01 billion in 2005 compared to a loss of
$122 million in 2004. The majority of the net gain on
AIGFP’s derivatives recognized in 2005 was due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and
British Pound, which resulted in an increase in the fair value
of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale
securities. To a lesser extent, the net gain was also due to the
fall in long-term U.S. interest rates, which resulted in an
increase in the fair value of AIGFP’s interest rate
derivatives hedging its assets and liabilities. The majority of
the net loss on AIGFP’s derivatives recognized in 2004 was
due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro
and British Pound, which resulted in a decrease in the fair
value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for
sale securities. This loss was partially offset by an increase
in the fair value of its interest rate derivatives hedging its
assets and liabilities as a result of the decrease in long-term
U.S. interest rates.

Financial market conditions in 2005 compared to 2004 were
characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield
curves across fixed income markets globally, some tightening of
credit spreads, higher equity valuations and a stronger
U.S. dollar. AIGFP’s 2005 results were adversely
affected by customer uncertainty surrounding the negative
actions of the rating agencies and the investigations, as well
as the negative effect on its structured notes business of AIG
being unable to fully access the capital markets during 2005.

Capital Markets operating income was also negatively affected in
2004 by the costs of the PNC settlement.

Consumer Finance

AIG’s consumer finance operations in North America are
principally conducted through AGF. Effective January 2,
2007, AGF expanded its operations into the United Kingdom
through the acquisition of Ocean Finance and Mortgages Limited,
a finance broker for home owner loans in the United Kingdom. AGF
derives a substantial portion of its revenues from finance
charges assessed on outstanding real estate loans, secured and
unsecured non-real estate loans and retail sales finance
receivables. The real estate loans are comprised principally of
first lien and some second lien mortgages on residential real
estate generally having a maximum term of 360 months, and
are considered non-conforming. The real estate loans may be
closed-end accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit and
may be fixed rate or adjustable rate products. AGF does not
offer mortgage products

with borrower payment options that allow for negative
amortization of the principal balance. The secured non-real
estate loans are secured by consumer goods, automobiles or other
personal property. Both secured and unsecured non-real estate
loans and retail sales finance receivables generally have a
maximum term of 60 months. The core of AGF’s
originations is sourced through its branches. However, a
significant volume of real estate loans is also originated
through broker relationships, and to lesser extents, through
correspondent relationships and direct mail solicitations. In
the first quarter of 2006, two wholly owned subsidiaries of AGF
discontinued originating real estate loans through an
arrangement with AIG Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered
thrift, and began originating such loans under their own state
licenses.

AIG’s foreign consumer finance operations are principally
conducted through AIGCFG. AIGCFG operates primarily in emerging
and developing markets. AIGCFG has operations in Argentina,
China, Hong Kong, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Taiwan and
Thailand. Certain of the AIGCFG operations are owned in part or
in whole by Life Insurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, the
financial results of those companies are shared between
Financial Services and Life Insurance & Retirement
Services according to their ownership percentages. While
products vary by market, the businesses generally provide credit
cards, unsecured and secured non-real estate loans, term
deposits, savings accounts, retail sales finance and real estate
loans. AIGCFG originates finance receivables through its
branches and direct solicitation. AIGCFG also originates finance
receivables indirectly through relationships with retailers,
auto dealers, and independent agents.

Consumer Finance Results

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Consumer Finance operating income decreased to
$761 million, or 13 percent, in 2006 compared to 2005.
Operating income from domestic consumer finance operations
declined as a result of decreased originations and purchases of
real estate loans and margin compression resulting from
increased interest rates and flattened yield curves. The foreign
operations operating income decreased primarily due to the
credit deterioration in the Taiwan credit card market.

Domestically, the U.S. housing market deteriorated
throughout 2006 and ended the year fairly weak compared to
recent years. As a result, the real estate loan portfolio
decreased slightly during 2006 due to lower refinancing
activity. This lower refinancing activity also caused a
significant decrease in originations and whole loan sales in
AGF’s mortgage banking operation, which resulted in a
substantial reduction of revenue and operating income compared
to the prior year. However, softening home prices (reducing the
equity customers are able to extract from their homes when
refinancing) and higher mortgage rates contributed to customers
utilizing non-real estate loans, which increased 10 percent
compared to 2005. Retail sales finance receivables also
increased 23 percent due to increased marketing efforts and
customer demand. Higher revenue resulting from portfolio growth
was more than offset by higher interest expense. AGF’s
short-term borrowing rates were 5.14 percent in 2006
compared to 3.58 percent in 2005. AGF’s long-term
borrowing rates were 5.05 percent in 2006 compared to
4.41 percent in 2005. AGF’s net charge-off ratio
improved to 0.95 percent in 2006 from 1.19 percent in 2005. The
improvement in the net charge-off ratio in 2006 was primarily
due to positive economic fundamentals. The U.S. economy
continued to expand during the year, and the unemployment rate
remained low, which improved the credit quality of AGF’s
portfolio. AGF’s delinquency ratio remained relatively low,
although it increased to 2.06 percent at December 31,
2006 from 1.93 percent at December 31, 2005. AGF
reduced the hurricane Katrina portion of its allowance for
finance receivable losses to $15 million at
December 31, 2006 after the reevaluation of its remaining
estimated losses. AGF’s allowance ratio was
2.01 percent at December 31, 2006 compared to
2.20 percent at December 31, 2005.

Revenues from the foreign consumer finance operations increased
by approximately 19 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Loan
growth, particularly in Poland and Argentina, was the primary
driver behind the higher revenues. Higher revenues were more
than offset, however, by AIGCFG’s $47 million share of
the allowance for losses related to industry-wide credit
deterioration in the Taiwan credit card market, increased cost
of funds, and higher operating expenses in connection with
expansion into new markets and distribution channels and new
product promotions, resulting in lower operating income for 2006
compared to 2005.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Revenues and operating income from the Consumer Finance
operations improved in 2005, both domestically and
internationally.

Domestically, the relatively low interest rate environment
contributed to a high level of mortgage refinancing activity.
AGF’s real estate loans increased 21 percent during
2005 compared to 2004. AGF’s short-term borrowing rates
rose to 3.58 percent in 2005 compared to 2.68 percent
in 2004. AGF’s long-term borrowing rates were
4.41 percent in 2005 compared to 4.28 percent in 2004.
Despite high energy costs, the U.S. economy continued to
expand during 2005, improving consumer credit quality. Both
AGF’s net charge-off ratio and delinquency ratio improved
in 2005 compared to 2004. AGF’s net charge-off ratio
improved to 1.19 percent in 2005 from 1.60 percent in
2004. The improvement in the net charge-off ratio in 2005 was
primarily due to the improving economy and a higher proportion
of average net receivables that were real estate loans.
AGF’s delinquency ratio at December 31, 2005 was 1.93
percent compared to 2.31 percent at December 31, 2004.
However, AGF incurred charges of approximately $62 million
for the estimated effect of hurricane Katrina on customers in
the Gulf Coast areas affected by the storm. At December 31,
2005, AGF’s allowance ratio was 2.20 percent compared
to 2.26 percent at December 31, 2004.

Foreign consumer finance operations performed well, as the
operations in Poland and Argentina recorded improved growth in
operating income. The Hong Kong businesses experienced improved
loan and earnings growth in a strengthening economy.

Asset Management Operations

AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety
of investment-related services and investment products. Such
services and products are offered to individuals and
institutions both domestically and overseas, and are primarily
comprised of Spread-Based Investment Businesses, Institutional
Asset Management and Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds.

The revenues and operating income for this segment are subject
to variability because they are affected by the general
conditions in the equity and credit markets. In addition,
realized gains and performance fees are contingent upon various
fund closings, maturity levels and market conditions.

Spread-Based Investment Business

In prior years, the sale of GICs to investors, both domestically
and overseas, was AIG’s primary institutional Spread-Based
Investment Business. During 2005, AIG launched its MIP and its
asset management subsidiaries, primarily SunAmerica Life, ceased
writing new GIC business. The GIC business will continue to run
off for the foreseeable future while the MIP business is
expected to grow.

Institutional Asset Management

AIG’s Institutional Asset Management business provides an
array of investment products and services globally to
institutional investors, AIG subsidiaries and affiliates and
high net worth investors. These products and services include
traditional equity and fixed income investment management and a
full range of alternative asset classes. Delivery of AIG’s
Institutional Asset Management products and services is
accomplished via a global network of operating subsidiaries
comprising AIGGIG. The primary operating entities within this
group are AIG Global Investment Corp., AIG Global Real Estate
Investment Corp. and AIG Private Bank. AIG Private Bank offers
banking, trading and investment management services to private
client and high net worth individuals and institutions globally.

Within the alternative investment asset class, AIGGIG offers
hedge and private equity fund-of-funds, direct investments and
distressed debt investments. Within the structured fixed income
and equity product asset class, AIGGIG offers various forms of
structured and credit linked notes, various forms of
collateralized debt obligations and other investment strategies
aimed at achieving superior returns or capital preservation. In
addition, Institutional Asset Management’s product
offerings include various forms of principal protected and
liability management structures.

Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds

AIG’s Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds business provides
mutual fund and broker-dealer related services to retail
investors, group trusts and corporate accounts through an
independent network of financial advisors. The AIG Advisor
Group, Inc., a subsidiary of AIG Retirement Services, Inc., is
comprised of several broker-dealer entities that provide these
services to clients primarily in the U.S. marketplace. SAAMCo
manages, advises and/or administers retail mutual funds, as well
as the underlying assets of variable annuities sold by AIG
SunAmerica and VALIC to individuals and groups throughout the
United States.

Other

Included in the Other category for Asset Management is income or
loss from partnerships. Partnership assets consist of
investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds,
affordable housing partnerships and hedge fund investments.

Asset Management Results

Asset Management results for 2006, 2005
and 2004 were as follows:

(a)

Includes the effect of hedging activities that did not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133,
    including the related foreign exchange gains and losses. For
    2004, the effect was a gain of $313 million in operating
    income. During 2006 and 2005, these derivative gains and losses
    were reported as part of AIG’s Other category, and were not
    reported in Asset Management operating income.

(b)

Includes the full results of certain AIG managed private
    equity and real estate funds that are consolidated pursuant to
    FIN 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities”. Also includes $346 million, $261 million
    and $195 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of
    third-party limited partner earnings offset in minority interest
    expense on the consolidated statement of income which is not a
    component of operating income.

(c)

Includes the full results of certain AIG managed partnerships
    that are consolidated effective January 1, 2006 pursuant to
    EITF

04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights”. For
    2006, operating income includes $252 million of third-party
    limited partner earnings offset in minority interest expense
    which is not a component of operating income.

Continued

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Asset Management operating income increased 4 percent in
2006 compared to 2005 on revenues that increased 9 percent.

Operating income related to the Spread-Based Investment Business
declined 20 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily
to the continued runoff of GIC balances and spread compression
related to increases in short-term interest rates. A significant
portion of the remaining GIC portfolio consists of floating rate
obligations. AIG has entered into hedges to manage against
increases in short-term interest rates. AIG believes these
hedges are economically effective, but they did not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Income or loss
from these hedges are classified as realized capital gains or
losses and are included in AIG’s Other category. The
decline in operating income was partially offset by improved
partnership income, particularly during the fourth quarter of
2006. Partnership income is primarily derived from alternative
investments and is affected by performance in the equity
markets. Thus, revenues, operating income and cash flow
attributable to GICs will vary among reporting periods.
Commencing with transactions initiated in the first quarter of
2007, AIG is reinstituting hedge accounting for derivative
transactions related to the MIP.

During 2005, the MIP replaced the GIC program as AIG’s
principal spread-based investment activity. While the MIP showed
strong growth in operating income, AIG does not expect that the
income growth in the MIP will offset the runoff in the GIC
portfolio for the foreseeable future, because the asset mix
under the MIP does not include the alternative investments
utilized in the GIC program.

The MIP was initially launched in the Euromarkets in September
2005 through AIG’s $10 billion Euro medium term note
program. Through December 31, 2006, AIG has issued the
equivalent of $5.3 billion for the MIP in the Euromarkets
and the U.S. public and private markets.

Operating income related to Institutional Asset Management
increased 50 percent in 2006 to $1.0 billion compared
to 2005, primarily due to an increase of $337 million in
gains on certain VIEs and partnerships. These gains are offset
in minority interest expense, which is not a component of
operating income. AIG’s unaffiliated client assets under
management, including both retail mutual funds and institutional
accounts, increased 21 percent from year-end 2005 to
$75 billion, resulting in higher management fee income.
Increased realized capital gains on real estate investments from
2005 also contributed to the increase in operating income. The
growth in Institutional Asset Management revenues and operating
income were driven by contributions from all asset classes
globally. Partially offsetting this growth were lower
performance-based fees on private equity investments, and higher
expenses related to the planned expansion of marketing and
distribution capabilities, combined with technology and
operational infrastructure-related enhancements.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

Asset Management operating income increased in 2005 compared to
2004 as a result of growth in institutional assets under
management, and the associated fee revenue, along with strong
realized gains on sales of real estate investments and
performance fees earned on various private equity investments.
The increase in operating income was achieved despite the runoff
of the existing GIC portfolio and the delay in the MIP. The
decline in GIC operating income compared to 2004 reflects
tighter spreads in the GIC portfolio, partially offset by
improved partnership returns. Spread compression occurred as the
base portfolio yield declined due to an increase in the cost of
funds in the short-term floating rate portion of the GIC
portfolio, only partially offset by increased investment income
from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio.

Other Operations

The operating loss of AIG’s Other category for the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

2006 and 2005 Comparison

Operating loss for AIG’s Other category declined to
$1.7 billion in 2006 compared to $2.5 billion in 2005,
largely due to regulatory settlement costs of $1.6 billion
in 2005 as described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Interest expense grew in 2006 as a result of increased
borrowings by the parent holding company. Unallocated corporate
expenses increased $142 million due to increases in general
corporate expenses primarily resulting from ongoing efforts to
improve internal controls, higher stock compensation expenses
and expenses relating to executive departures in 2005 and 2006.
AIG expects these compensation expenses to continue to increase
as these improvement efforts progress. Operating income in 2006
also includes realized capital losses of $295 million,
primarily reflecting the effect of hedging activities in the
Financial Services and Asset Management segments that did not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Also
reflected in Other operating loss in 2006 is an out of period
charge of $61 million with respect to the SICO Plans and a
one-time charge related to the Starr tender offer of
$54 million. For a further discussion of these items, see
Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
These declines were partially

offset by increased equity earnings in certain unconsolidated
subsidiaries.

2005 and 2004 Comparison

AIG’s Other operating loss was $2.5 billion in 2005
compared to $562 million in 2004, reflecting the
$1.6 billion of regulatory settlement costs in 2005. In
addition, AIG’s equity in certain partially owned
subsidiaries includes $312 million and $96 million in
catastrophe losses in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Capital Resources and
Liquidity

At December 31, 2006, AIG had total consolidated
shareholders’ equity of $101.68 billion and total
consolidated borrowings of $148.68 billion. At that date,
$131.55 billion of such borrowings were not guaranteed by
AIG, were matched borrowings by AIG or AIGFP, or represented
liabilities connected to trust preferred stock.

In 2007, AIG expects to issue capital securities in one or more
series. The proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of common
stock or to otherwise improve the efficiency of AIG’s
capital structure.

Borrowings

At December 31, 2006, AIG’s
net borrowings were $17.13 billion after reflecting amounts
that were matched borrowings by AIG and AIGFP, amounts not

stock. The following table summarizes borrowings outstanding at

The debt activity, excluding commercial
paper of $12.15 billion and VIE debt of $3.25 billion,
for the year ended December 31, 2006 was as
follows:

AIG (Parent Company)

AIG intends to continue its customary practice of issuing debt
securities from time to time to meet its financing needs and
those of certain of its subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes, as well as for the MIP. In July 2006, AIG filed and
had declared effective a post-effective amendment to its
universal shelf registration statement to sell up to
$25.1 billion of debt securities, preferred and common
stock and other securities.

In October 2006, AIG established a medium term note program
under its shelf registration statement providing for the
issuance of up to $25.1 billion of AIG debt securities. The
proceeds from the issuance of these debt securities may be used
(i) by AIG for general corporate purposes, (ii) by
AIGFP as it would use the proceeds from its own borrowings as
discussed below or (iii) to fund the MIP. As of
December 31, 2006, $1.8 billion principal amount of
notes were outstanding under the medium term note program, of
which (i) $749 million was used for AIG’s general
corporate purposes, (ii) $72 million was used by AIGFP
and (iii) $1.0 billion was used to fund the MIP. The
maturity dates of these notes range from 2011 to 2046. To the
extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions
to manage its effective borrowing with respect to these notes.

AIG also maintains a Euro medium term note program under which
an aggregate nominal amount of up to $10.0 billion of notes
may be outstanding at any one time. The program provides that
additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed
notes. As of December 31, 2006, the equivalent of
$5.7 billion of notes were outstanding under the program,
of which $3.7 billion were used to fund the MIP and the
remainder was used for AIG’s general corporate purposes.
The aggregate amount outstanding includes $249 million
resulting from foreign exchange translation into
U.S. dollars, of which $151 million relates to notes
issued by AIG for general corporate purposes and
$98 million relates to notes issued to fund the MIP. AIG
has hedged the currency exposure arising from foreign currency
denominated notes by effectively economically hedging that
exposure, although such hedges did not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment under FAS 133. In 2007, through
February 15, AIG issued the equivalent of $194 million
under the Euro program to fund the MIP.

In 2006, AIG issued in Rule 144A/Regulation S
offerings $3 billion principal amount of senior notes, of
which $1.0 billion was exchanged by AIG for substantially
identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act.
The proceeds from the sale of $2.25 billion of these notes
were used for AIG’s general corporate purposes and
$750 million was used to fund the MIP. In 2007, through
February 15, AIG issued in Rule 144A offerings an
aggregate of $750 million principal amount of senior notes, of
which $500 million was used to fund the MIP and
$250 million was used for AIG’s general corporate
purposes.

In November 2006, AIG filed a shelf registration statement in
Japan, providing for the issuance of up to Japanese
Yen 300 billion principal amount of senior notes. In
December 2006, AIG issued the equivalent of $429 million
under the Japanese shelf registration statement, the proceeds of
which were used for AIG’s general corporate purposes.

In November 2006, AIG established an Australian dollar debt
program under which senior notes with an aggregate amount of up
to 5 billion Australian dollars may be outstanding at any
one time. The program provides that additional notes may be
issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. Although as of
December 31, 2006 there were no outstanding notes under the
Australian program, AIG intends to use the program
opportunistically to fund the MIP or for AIG’s general
corporate purposes.

In March 2006, AIG borrowed a total of $1.3 billion on an
unsecured basis pursuant to loan agreements with third-party
banks, of which $700 million remained outstanding on Decem-

ber 31, 2006; $500 million was repaid in
February 2007, and the balance matures in March 2007.

AIGFP

AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and
GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of
securities and derivative transactions. The borrowings may also
be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements
to resell. AIGFP’s notes and bonds include structured debt
instruments whose payment terms are linked to one or more
financial or other indices (such as an equity index or commodity
index or another measure that is not considered to be clearly
and closely related to the debt instrument). These notes contain
embedded derivatives that otherwise would be required to be
accounted for separately under FAS 133. Upon AIG’s
early adoption of FAS 155, AIGFP elected the fair value
option for these notes. The notes that are accounted for using
the fair value option are reported separately under hybrid
financial instrument liabilities. AIG guarantees the obligations
of AIGFP under AIGFP’s notes and bonds and GIA borrowings.
See Operating Review — Financial Services Operations,
Liquidity and Derivatives herein.

In June 2006, AIGFP sold an aggregate of $2.0 billion
principal amount of senior, floating rate notes in
Rule 144A offerings, of which $1.0 billion matures in
2007 and $1.0 billion matures in 2008. AIGFP also has a
Euro medium term note program under which an aggregate nominal
amount of up to $10.0 billion of notes may be outstanding
at any one time. The program provides that additional notes may
be issued to replace matured or redeemed notes. As of
December 31, 2006, $5.66 billion of notes were
outstanding under the program, including $575 million
resulting from foreign exchange translation into
U.S. dollars. AIGFP’s Rule 144A Notes and the notes
issued under this program are guaranteed by AIG and are included
in AIGFP’s Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table
of borrowings.

AIG Funding

AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), issues commercial paper that is
guaranteed by AIG in order to help fulfill the short-term cash
requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. The issuance of AIG
Funding’s commercial paper, including the guarantee by AIG,
is subject to the approval of AIG’s Board of Directors or
the Finance Committee of the Board if it exceeds certain
pre-approved limits.

As backup for the commercial paper program and for other general
corporate purposes, AIG and AIG Funding maintain revolving
credit facilities, which, as of December 31, 2006, had an
aggregate of $5.8 billion available to be drawn and which
are summarized below under Revolving Credit Facilities.

ILFC

ILFC fulfills its short-term cash requirements through operating
cash flows and the issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of
commercial paper is subject to the approval of ILFC’s Board
of Directors and is not guaranteed by AIG. ILFC maintains
syndicated revolving credit facilities which, as of
December 31, 2006, aggregated $6.5 billion and which
are summarized below under Revolving Credit Facilities. These
facilities are used as back up for ILFC’s maturing
debt and other obligations.

As a well-known seasoned issuer, ILFC has filed an automatic
shelf registration statement with the SEC allowing ILFC
immediate access to the U.S. public debt markets. For 2006,
$1.90 billion of debt securities were issued under this
registration statement and $3.52 billion were issued under
a prior registration statement. In addition, ILFC has a Euro
medium term note program for $7.0 billion, under which
$4.28 billion in notes were sold through December 31,
2006. Notes issued under the Euro medium term note program are
included in ILFC Notes and bonds payable in the preceding table
of borrowings. The foreign exchange adjustment for the foreign
currency denominated debt was $733 million at
December 31, 2006 and $197 million at
December 31, 2005. ILFC has substantially eliminated the
currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated
notes by economically hedging the portion of the note exposure
not already offset by Euro-denominated operating lease payments,
although such hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133.

ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility for use in
connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft
delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various
European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from
5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing
ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the
aircraft. At December 31, 2006, ILFC had $1.0 billion
outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a
pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title
to the aircraft financed under the facility.

In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured Export
Credit Facility for up to a maximum of $2.64 billion for
Airbus aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2005. The
facility was subsequently increased to $3.64 billion and
extended to include aircraft to be delivered through
May 31, 2007. The facility becomes available as the various
European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for
aircraft based on a six-month forward-looking calendar, and the
interest rate is determined through a bid process. At
December 31, 2006, ILFC had $1.7 billion outstanding
under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities
are included in ILFC’s Notes and bonds payable in the
preceding table of borrowings.

From time to time, ILFC enters into funded financing agreements.
As of December 31, 2006, ILFC had a total of $1.2 billion
outstanding, which has varying maturities through February 2012.
The interest rates are LIBOR-based, with spreads ranging from
0.30 percent to 1.625 percent.

In December of 2005, ILFC issued two tranches of junior
subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion to underlie trust
preferred securities issued by a trust sponsored by ILFC. Both
tranches mature on December 21, 2065, but each tranche has
a different call option. The $600 million tranche has a
call date of December 21, 2010 and the $400 million
tranche has a call date of December 21, 2015. The tranche
with the 2010 call date has a fixed interest rate of
5.90 percent for the first five years. The tranche with the
2015 call date has a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent
for the first ten years.

The proceeds of ILFC’s debt financing are primarily used to
purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during
the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of
this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow
from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and
the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. AIG does not
guarantee the debt obligations of ILFC. See also Operating
Review — Financial Services Operations and Liquidity
herein.

AGF

AGF fulfills its short-term cash requirements through the
issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper
is subject to the approval of AGF’s Board of Directors and
is not guaranteed by AIG. AGF maintains committed syndicated
revolving credit facilities which, as of December 31, 2006,
aggregated to $4.25 billion and which are summarized below
under Revolving Credit Facilities. The facilities can be used
for general corporate purposes and to provide backup for
AGF’s commercial paper programs.

AGF issued $3.62 billion during 2006 and $5.51 billion
during 2005 of notes and bonds ranging in maturities from two to
25 years. As of December 31, 2006, notes and bonds
aggregating $19.59 billion were outstanding with maturity
dates ranging from 2007 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from
1.94 percent to 8.45 percent. To the extent deemed
appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its
effective borrowing with respect to these notes and bonds. As a
well-known seasoned issuer, AGF has filed an automatic shelf
registration statement with the SEC allowing AGF immediate
access to the U.S. public debt markets. At
December 31, 2006, AGF had the corporate authority to issue
up to $13.4 billion of debt securities under its shelf
registration statements.

In January 2007, AGF issued junior subordinated debentures in an
aggregate principal amount of $350 million that mature in
January 2067. The debentures underlie a series of trust
preferred securities sold by a trust sponsored by AGF in a
Rule 144A/Regulation S offering. AGF can redeem the
debentures at par beginning in January 2017 and until that time
will pay a fixed rate of interest. If AGF does not redeem the
debentures in January 2017, the interest rate changes to a
floating rate, which will reset based on 3-month LIBOR.

AGF’s funding sources include a medium term note program,
private placement debt, retail note issuances, securitizations
of finance receivables that AGF accounts for as on-balance-sheet
secured financings and bank financings. In addition, AGF has
become an established issuer of long-term debt in the
international capital markets.

In addition to debt refinancing activities, proceeds from the
collection of finance receivables may be used to pay the
principal and interest on AGF’s debt. AIG does not
guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF. See also Operating
Review — Financial Services Operations and Liquidity
herein.

AIGCFG

AIGCFG has a variety of funding mechanisms for its various
markets, including: retail and wholesale deposits; short-term
and long-term bank loans and intercompany subordinated debt. AIG
Credit Card Company (Taiwan), a consumer finance business in
Taiwan, has issued commercial paper for the funding of its own
operations. AIG does not guarantee any borrowings for AIGCFG
businesses, including this commercial paper.

Revolving Credit Facilities

AIG, ILFC and AGF maintain the following committed, unsecured
revolving credit facilities in order to support their respective
commercial paper programs and for general corporate purposes.
AIG, ILFC and AGF expect to replace or extend these credit
facilities on or prior to their expiration. Some of the
facilities, as noted below, contain a “term-out
option” allowing for the conversion by the borrower of any
outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans.

Credit Ratings

The cost and availability of unsecured financing for AIG and its
subsidiaries are generally dependent on their short-term and
long-term debt ratings. The following table presents the credit
ratings of AIG and certain of its subsidiaries as of
February 28, 2007. In parentheses, following the initial
occurrence in the table of each rating, is an indication of that
rating’s relative rank within the agency’s rating
categories. That ranking refers only to the generic or major
rating category and not to the modifiers appended to the rating
by the rating agencies to denote relative position within such
generic or major category.

These credit ratings are current opinions of the rating
agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn
at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or
unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances.
Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management’s request.
This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of
AIG and its subsidiaries. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for
more information regarding the credit ratings of AIG and its
subsidiaries and certain risks related thereto.

“Rating triggers” have been defined by one independent
rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of
which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or
more rating agencies. Rating triggers generally relate to events
which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of
credit availability, or require accelerated repayment,
(ii) could result in the termination of business contracts
or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the
benefit of counterparties.

AIG believes that any of its own or its subsidiaries’
contractual obligations that are subject to “ratings
triggers” or financial covenants relating to “ratings
triggers” would not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or liquidity. Ratings downgrades could also
trigger the application of termination provisions in certain of
AIG’s contracts, principally agreements entered into by
AIGFP and assumed reinsurance contracts entered into by
Transatlantic.

It is estimated that, as of the close of business on
February 15, 2007, based on AIGFP’s outstanding
municipal GIAs and financial derivatives transactions as of such
date, a downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to
‘Aa3’ by Moody’s or ‘AA-’ by S&P
would permit counterparties to call for approximately $864
million of collateral. Further, additional downgrades could
result in requirements for substantial additional collateral,
which could have a material effect on how AIGFP manages its
liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIGFP
would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such
downgrades depends on market conditions, the fair value of the
outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing
at the time of the downgrade. Additional obligations to post
collateral would increase the demand on AIGFP’s liquidity.

Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments

The maturity schedule of contractual
obligations of AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries at
December 31, 2006 was as follows:

(a)

Excludes commercial paper and obligations included as debt
    pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46R), and includes
    hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value.
    See also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

(b)

Represents future loss and loss adjustment expense payments
    estimated based on historical loss development payment
    patterns.

(c)

Insurance and investment contract liabilities include various
    investment-type products with contractually scheduled
    maturities, including periodic payments of a term certain
    nature. Insurance and investment contract liabilities also
    include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant
    portion represents policies and contracts that do not have
    stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any
    future payment obligations. For these policies and contracts
    (i) AIG is currently not making payments until the
    occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability,
    (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship, or
    (iii) the occurrence of a payment due to a surrender or
    other non-scheduled event out of AIG’s control. AIG has
    made significant assumptions to determine the estimated
    undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits
    which include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates,
    expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates,
    offset by expected future deposits and premium on in-force
    policies. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the
    amounts presented could be materially different from actual
    required payments. The amounts presented in this table are
    undiscounted and therefore exceed the future policy benefits and
    policyholder contract deposits included in the balance sheet.

(d)

Represents guaranteed maturities under GICs.

commercial commitments of AIG and its consolidated subsidiaries

Special Purpose Vehicles and Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements

AIG transacts with special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the
ordinary course of business. Many of these SPVs are included in
the consolidated financial statements but some are off balance
sheet.

AIG has guidelines with respect to the formation of and
investment in SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements. In
addition, AIG has expanded the responsibility of its Complex
Structured Financial Transaction Committee (CSFT) to include the
review of any transaction that could subject AIG to heightened
legal, reputational, regulatory, accounting or other risk. See
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures —
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting for a further discussion of the CSFT.

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings
in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in
the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital
needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise
additional funds through the issuance of additional securities.

In February 2007, AIG’s Board of Directors adopted a new
dividend policy, to take effect with the dividend to be declared
in the second quarter of 2007, providing that under ordinary
circumstances, AIG’s plan will be to increase its common
stock dividend by approximately 20 percent annually.

Share Repurchases

During 2006, AIG did not purchase any shares of its common stock
under its existing share repurchase authorization. At
December 31, 2006, an additional 36,542,700 shares
could be purchased under the then current authorization by
AIG’s Board of Directors. In February 2007, AIG’s
Board of Directors increased the repurchase program by
authorizing the repurchase of shares with an aggregate purchase
price of $8 billion. AIG or its subsidiaries from time to
time may buy shares of its common stock in the open market for
general corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations
under various employee benefit plans. During 2006, ILFC
purchased 17,000 shares of AIG common stock at an average
cost of $72.18 per share to satisfy its obligations under an
employee benefit plan. See Capital Resources and
Liquidity — Liquidity for a discussion of
possible share repurchases in 2007.

Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries

Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are
subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory
authorities. With respect to AIG’s domestic insurance
subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice
to the insurance department in which the particular insurance
subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an
insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the
insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below
certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may
restrict the ability of AIG’s foreign insurance
subsidiaries to pay dividends. The most significant foreign
insurance regulatory jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Singapore.
Largely as a result of the restrictions, approximately
90 percent of consolidated shareholders’ equity was
restricted from immediate transfer to AIG parent at
December 31, 2006. See Regulation and Supervision herein.
AIG cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may
affect the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay
dividends. To AIG’s knowledge, no AIG company is currently
on any regulatory or similar “watch list” with regard
to solvency. See also Liquidity herein, Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk
Factors — Liquidity.

Regulation and Supervision

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other
insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the
states and jurisdictions in which they do business. In the U.S.,
the NAIC has developed Risk-Based Capital
(RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance
company’s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its
overall operations.

In preparing both its 2004 and 2005 audited statutory financial
statements for its Domestic General Insurance companies, AIG
agreed with the relevant state regulatory authorities on the
statutory accounting treatment of the various items requiring
adjustment or restatement. With respect to the 2004 audited
statutory financial statements, these adjustments and
restatements reduced previously reported General Insurance
statutory surplus at December 31, 2004 by approximately
$3.5 billion, to approximately $20.6 billion. With
respect to the 2005 audited statutory financial statements, the
state regulators permitted the Domestic General Insurance
companies to record a $724 million reduction to opening
statutory surplus as of January 1, 2005.

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries file financial statements
prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices
prescribed or

76       AIG


Form

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory
authorities. The principal differences between statutory
financial statements and financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP for domestic companies are that
statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond
portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, assets and
liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder
liabilities are valued using more conservative assumptions and
certain assets are non-admitted.

In connection with the filing of the 2005 statutory financial
statements for AIG’s Domestic General Insurance companies,
AIG agreed with the relevant state insurance regulators on the
statutory accounting treatment of various items. The regulatory
authorities have also permitted certain of the domestic and
foreign insurance subsidiaries to support the carrying value of
their investments in certain non-insurance and foreign insurance
subsidiaries by utilizing the AIG audited consolidated financial
statements to satisfy the requirement that the
U.S. GAAP-basis equity of such entities be audited. In
addition, the regulatory authorities have permitted the Domestic
General Insurance companies to utilize audited financial
statements prepared on a basis of accounting other than
U.S. GAAP to value investments in joint ventures, limited
partnerships and hedge funds. AIG has received similar permitted
practices authorizations from insurance regulatory authorities
in connection with the 2006 statutory financial statements.
These permitted practices did not affect the Domestic General
Insurance companies’ compliance with minimum regulatory
capital requirements.

Statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum
company action level requirements following the adjustments, but
AIG nonetheless contributed an additional $750 million of
capital into American Home effective September 30, 2005 and
contributed a further $2.25 billion of capital in February
2006 for a total of approximately $3 billion of capital
into Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries effective
December 31, 2005. To enhance their current capital
positions, AIG suspended dividends from the DBG companies from
the fourth quarter 2005 through 2006, but AIG expects dividend
payments will resume in the first quarter of 2007. AIG believes
it has the capital resources and liquidity to fund any necessary
statutory capital contributions.

As discussed above, various regulators have commenced
investigations into certain insurance business practices. In
addition, the OTS and other regulators routinely conduct
examinations of AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIG’s
consumer finance operations. AIG cannot predict the ultimate
effect that these investigations and examinations, or any
additional regulation arising therefrom, might have on its
business. Federal, state or local legislation may affect
AIG’s ability to operate and expand its various financial
services businesses, and changes in the current laws,
regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material
adverse effect on these businesses.

AIG’s U.S. operations are negatively affected under
guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a
result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund
assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for
certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other
insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally
records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain
states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be
used as a credit against a company’s future premium tax
liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot
reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of
credits for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were
$97 million, $124 million and $118 million.

AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools
(principally workers compensation business) which provide
insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in
the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon
notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated.

A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business
and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement
Services business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree
of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies.
Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating
in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory
requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG
subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus,
AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from
conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where
they currently operate. AIG’s international operations
include operations in various developing nations. Both current
and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by
unfavorable political developments up to and including
nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation.
Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect
AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s
net financial exposure at that time in that country.

Foreign insurance operations are individually subject to local
solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of
adequate capitalization, which AIG complies with by country. In
addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have
established regulations that can result in guarantee fund
assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIG’s
financial condition or results of operations.

Liquidity

AIG manages liquidity at both the subsidiary and parent company
levels. At December 31, 2006, AIG’s consolidated
invested assets, primarily held by its subsidiaries, included
$26.8 billion in cash and short-term investments.
Consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in 2006
amounted to $6.8 billion. At the parent company level,
liquidity management activities are conducted in a manner to
preserve and enhance funding stability, flexibility, and
diversity through the full range of potential operating
environments and market conditions. AIG’s primary sources
of cash flow are dividends and other payments from its regulated
and unregulated subsidiaries, as well as issuances of debt
securities. Primary uses of cash flow are for debt service,
subsidiary funding and shareholder dividend payments. Management

of common stock.

Insurance Operations

The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived
both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating
cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations
and investment operations. Cash flow from underwriting
operations includes periodic premium collections, including
policyholders’ contract deposits, and paid loss recoveries,
less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and
operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when
premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence
of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are
paid. Investment cash flow is primarily derived from interest
and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net
of realized capital losses.

In addition to the combined insurance operating cash flow,
AIG’s insurance operations held $11.2 billion in cash
and short-term investments at December 31, 2006. Operating
cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held provided
AIG’s insurance operations with a significant amount of
liquidity. This liquidity is available, among other things, to
purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income
securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity
securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy
loans, and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with
proceeds of approximately $126 billion from the maturities,
sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the
sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately
$161 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity
securities during 2006.

General Insurance

General Insurance operating cash flow is derived from
underwriting and investment activities. With respect to General
Insurance operations, if paid losses accelerated beyond
AIG’s ability to fund such paid losses from current
operating cash flows, AIG might need to liquidate a portion of
its General Insurance investment portfolio and/or arrange for
financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain
could be the result of several significant catastrophic events
occurring in a relatively short period of time. Additional
strain on liquidity could occur if the investments liquidated to
fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place
and/or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became
uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance
recoverable significantly decreased in value.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services

Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating cash flow is
derived from underwriting and investment activities. If a
substantial portion of the Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in
value and/or defaulted, AIG might need to liquidate other
portions of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services
investment portfolio and/or arrange financing. Potential events
causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic
collapse of a nation or region in which Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations exist, nationalization, terrorist
acts, or other economic or political upheaval. In addition, a
significant rise in interest rates leading to a major increase
in policyholder surrenders could also create a liquidity strain.

Financial Services

AIG’s major Financial Services operating subsidiaries
consist of AIGFP, ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG. Sources of funds
considered in meeting the liquidity needs of AIGFP’s
operations include GIAs, issuance of long-term and short-term
debt, proceeds from maturities, sales of securities available
for sale and securities and spot commodities leased or sold
under repurchase agreements. ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG utilize the
commercial paper markets, bank loans and bank credit facilities
as sources of liquidity. ILFC and AGF also fund in the domestic
and international capital markets without reliance on any
guarantee from AIG. An additional source of liquidity for ILFC
is the use of export credit facilities. AIGCFG also uses
wholesale and retail bank deposits as sources of funds. On
occasion, AIG has provided equity capital to ILFC, AGF and
AIGCFG and provides intercompany loans to AIGCFG.

Asset Management

Asset Management operating cash flow is derived primarily from
investment income in connection with domestic and foreign GICs
and from the collection of various forms of investment
management fees, brokerage commissions and custody fees earned
from affiliated and unaffiliated clients. Investment management
fees are typically asset-based fees collected on a periodic
basis, while brokerage commissions and custody fees are more
transaction driven and received on a continual basis. Asset
Management also derives cash from the realization of gains
earned through its investment partnership holdings and collects
various forms of incentive management fees. These incentive
management fees, which are typically based on the appreciation
and/or realization of gains on managed assets, are generally
received in the form of carried interest earned from sponsored
funds managed on behalf of clients. Asset Management’s
spread-based investment business derives cash from the
investment income and the sale of invested assets backing these
contract liabilities.

AIGGIG incurs expenses with associated cash outflows from the
operation of its business, including costs related to portfolio
management and related back and middle office costs. In
addition, cash is used in association with investment
warehousing activities wherein AIGGIG funds and holds an
investment for the benefit of a future investment vehicle.

Cash needs for the spread-based investment business are
principally the result of GIC maturities. Significant blocks of
the GIC portfolio will mature over the next five years. AIG
utilizes asset liability matching to control liquidity risks
associated with

78       AIG


Form

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

this business. In addition, AIG believes that its products
incorporate certain restrictions which encourage persistency,
limiting the magnitude of unforeseen surrenders in the GIC
portfolio.

Liquidity for Asset Management operations can be affected by
significant credit or geopolitical events that might cause a
delay in fund closings, securitizations or an inability of
AIG’s clients to fund their capital commitments. AIGGIG has
relied upon AIG from time to time in order to fund certain
liquidity requirements associated with investment warehousing.
In addition, AIG Global Real Estate maintains several external
credit lines in order to fund its ongoing property development
and construction related activities.

AIG (Parent Company)

The liquidity of the parent company is principally derived from
its subsidiaries. The primary sources of cash flow are dividends
and other payments from its regulated and unregulated
subsidiaries, as well as issuance of debt securities. Primary
uses of cash flow are for debt service, subsidiary funding,
shareholder dividend payments and purchases of outstanding
shares of common stock. In 2006, AIG Parent collected $2.1
billion in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries and
issued $6.6 billion in debt securities excluding MIP and Series
AIGFP debt. AIG Parent also made interest payments totaling $232
million, made $2.9 billion in capital contributions to
subsidiaries (principally $2.3 billion to DBG), and paid
$1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2006. No share
repurchases were made by AIG Parent in 2006.

AIG funds its short-term working capital needs through
commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. As of December 31,
2006, AIG Funding had $4.8 billion of commercial paper
outstanding with an average maturity of 28 days. As
additional liquidity, AIG and AIG Funding maintain revolving
credit facilities that, as of December 31, 2006, had an
aggregate of $5.8 billion available to be drawn, which are
summarized above under Revolving Credit Facilities.

At the parent company level, liquidity management activities are
conducted in a manner intended to preserve and enhance funding
stability, flexibility, and diversity through the full range of
potential operating environments and market conditions.
Assessing liquidity risk involves forecasting of cash
inflows/outflows on both a short- and long-term basis. Corporate
Treasury is responsible for formulating the parent
company’s liquidity and contingency planning efforts, as
well as for execution of AIG’s specific funding activities.
Through active liquidity management, AIG seeks to retain stable,
reliable and cost-effective funding sources. In addition to
current liquidity requirements, factors which affect funding
decisions include market conditions, prevailing interest rates
and the desired maturity profile of liabilities. The objectives
of contingency planning are to ensure maintenance of appropriate
liquidity during normal and stress periods, to measure and
project funding requirements during periods of stress, and to
manage access to funding sources. Diversification of funding
sources is an important element of AIG’s liquidity risk
management approach.

AIG’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access
the capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflows of
cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may
be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an
operational problem that affects third parties or AIG.
Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit AIG’s
ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its
subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIG’s subsidiaries,
including its insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws and
regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce
the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that
prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances.
These laws and regulations may hinder AIG’s ability to
access funds that it may need to make payments on its
obligations. Because of the wide geographic profile of
AIG’s regulated subsidiaries, management believes that
these cash flows represent a diversified source of liquidity for
AIG. For a further discussion of the regulatory environment in
which AIG subsidiaries operate and other issues affecting
AIG’s liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Invested Assets

AIG’s investment strategy is to invest primarily in high
quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid
significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country
concentrations.

At December 31, 2005, approximately 70 percent and

General Insurance Invested Assets

In AIG’s General Insurance business, the duration of
liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than other
lines. As differentiated from the Life Insurance &
Retirement Services companies, the focus is not on
asset-liability matching, but on preservation of capital and
growth of surplus.

Fixed income holdings of the Domestic General Insurance
companies are comprised primarily of tax-exempt securities,
which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. These
high quality municipal investments have an average rating of
high AA.

Fixed income assets held in Foreign General Insurance are of
high quality and short to intermediate duration, averaging
4.2 years compared to 7.2 years for those in Domestic
General Insurance.

While reserves are invested in conventional fixed income
securities in Domestic General Insurance, a modest portion of
surplus is allocated to large capitalization, high-dividend,
public equity strategies and to alternative investments,
including private equity and hedge funds. These investments have
provided a combination of added diversification and attractive
long-term returns.

General Insurance invested assets grew by $21.3 billion, or
22 percent, during 2006 as bond holdings grew by
$17 billion, or 24 percent. Listed equity holdings
remained essentially flat at $6.5 billion.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services
Invested Assets

With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services,
AIG’s investment strategy is to produce cash flows greater
than maturing insurance liabilities. AIG actively manages the
asset-liability relationship in its foreign operations, as it
has been doing throughout AIG’s history, even though
certain territories lack qualified long-term investments or
certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment
restrictions. For example, in several Southeast Asian countries,
the duration of investments is shorter than the effective
maturity of the related policy liabilities. Therefore, there is
risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at

AIG        81

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Operations

Continued

the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below
that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy
liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future investment risk
associated with certain policies currently in-force which will
have premium receipts in the future. That is, the investment of
these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that
required to meet future policy liabilities.

In 2006, new money investment rates generally increased in the
U.S., Japan and Taiwan, and were generally unchanged in
Thailand. In regard to in-force business, management focus is
required in both the investment and product management process
to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to
support future policy liabilities. Business strategies continue
to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business. In
some countries, new products are being introduced with minimal
investment guarantees resulting in a shift toward investment
linked savings products and away from traditional savings
products with higher guarantees.

The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the
proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active
management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory
investment quality and liquidity.

AIG may use alternative investments in certain foreign
jurisdictions where interest rates remain low and there are
limited long-dated bond markets, including equities, real estate
and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to
extend the duration or increase the yield of the investment
portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the
policyholder liabilities and DAC recoverability. This strategy
has been effectively used in Japan and more recently by Nan Shan
in Taiwan. In Japan, foreign assets, excluding those matched to
foreign liabilities, were approximately 30 percent of
statutory assets, which is below the maximum allowable
percentage under current local regulation. Foreign assets
comprised approximately 32 percent of Nan Shan’s
invested assets at December 31, 2006, slightly below the
maximum allowable percentage under current local regulation. The
majority of Nan Shan’s in-force policy portfolio is
traditional life and endowment insurance products with implicit
interest rate guarantees. New business with lower interest rate
guarantees are gradually reducing the overall interest
requirements, but asset portfolio yields have declined faster
due to the prolonged low interest rate environment. As a result,
although the investment margins for a large block of in-force
policies are negative, the block remains profitable because the
mortality and expense margins presently exceed the negative
investment spread. In response to the low interest rate
environment and the volatile exchange rate of the NT dollar, Nan
Shan is emphasizing new products with lower implied guarantees,
including participating endowments and investment linked
products. Although the risks of a continued low interest rate
environment coupled with a volatile NT dollar could increase net
liabilities and require additional capital to maintain adequate
local solvency margins, Nan Shan currently believes it has
adequate resources to meet all future policy obligations.

AIG actively manages the asset-liability relationship in its
domestic operations. This relationship is more easily managed
through the availability of qualified long-term investments.

A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits or
guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain
variable life and variable annuity products. AIG manages its
exposure resulting from these long-term guarantees through
reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments.

AIG invests in equities for various reasons, including
diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk.
Available for sale bonds and equity securities are subject to
declines in fair value. Such declines in fair value are
presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of
investments, net of taxes, as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income. Declines that are determined to be
other-than-temporary are reflected in income in the period in
which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer
exists. See Valuation of Invested Assets herein. Generally,
insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an
insurance company may invest. When permitted by regulatory
authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance
assets, including invested assets, from adverse movements in
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity
prices, AIG and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into
derivative transactions as end users to hedge their exposures.
For a further discussion of AIG’s use of derivatives, see
Risk Management — Credit Risk Management —
Derivatives herein.

In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign
governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate
free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the
insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. For a discussion of these
restrictions, see Item 1. Business — Regulation.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services invested assets grew by
$37.0 billion, or 10 percent, during 2006 as bond
holdings grew by $15.1 billion, or 6 percent, and
listed equity holdings grew by $6.7 billion, or
41 percent. For a discussion of credit risk exposures, see
Risk Management — Credit Risk Management herein.

Financial Services Invested Assets

ILFC

The cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived
primarily from the proceeds of ILFC’s debt financings. The
primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the related
interest expense are ILFC’s cash flow from operations,
proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and
refinancing of the prior debt. During 2006, ILFC acquired flight
equipment costing $6.0 billion. For a further discussion of
ILFC’s borrowings, see Operating Review —
Financial Services Operations — Aircraft Leasing and
Capital Resources — Borrowings herein.

At December 31, 2006, ILFC had committed to purchase 254
new aircraft deliverable from 2007 through 2015 for an estimated
aggregate purchase price of $19.0 billion. As of
February 22, 2007, ILFC has entered into leases for all of
the new aircraft to be delivered in 2007, and 64 of 171 of the
new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2007. ILFC will be
required to find customers for any aircraft currently on order
and any aircraft to be

ordered, and it must arrange financing for portions of the
purchase price of such equipment. ILFC has been successful to
date both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales
contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no
assurance that such success will continue in future environments.

Capital Markets

Capital Markets derivative transactions are carried at market
value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not
readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure
through similarly valued offsetting transactions including
swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The
estimated fair values of these transactions represent
assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows.
These transactions would be exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP
were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to
maturity. AIG believes that the effect of any such event would
not be significant to AIG’s financial condition or its
overall liquidity. For a further discussion on the use of
derivatives by Capital Markets, see Operating Review —
Financial Services Operations — Capital Markets and
Risk Management — Derivatives herein and Note 19
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and
GIAs to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities,
including securities available for sale, at market, and
derivative transactions. The funds may also be invested in
securities purchased under agreements to resell. The proceeds
from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for
sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell are
used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP financings, or
invest in new assets. For a further discussion of AIGFP’s
borrowings, see Capital Resources — Borrowings herein.

Securities available for sale is predominately a diversified
portfolio of high grade fixed income securities, where the
individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk. At
December 31, 2006, the average credit rating of this
portfolio was in the AA+ category or the equivalent thereto as
determined through rating agencies or internal review. AIGFP has
also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically
hedge its credit risk associated with $128 million of these
securities. Securities deemed below investment grade at
December 31, 2006 amounted to approximately
$340 million in fair value, representing 0.7 percent
of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There have
been no significant downgrades through February 15, 2007.
If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer
significant default and the collateral held declined
significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default
swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a
liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFP’s payment
obligations, including its debt obligations.

AIGFP’s exposure management objective is to minimize
interest rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated
with its securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP
purchases a security for its securities available for sale
investment portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an
offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the
hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment
security, which achieves the economic result of converting the
return on the underlying security to U.S. dollar LIBOR plus
or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each
security on the initial trade date. The market risk associated
with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with
third-party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge
accounting treatment was not achieved in 2006, the unrealized
gains and losses on the derivative transactions with
unaffiliated third parties were reflected in operating income.
The unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities
available for sale resulting from changes in interest rates and
currency rates and commodity and equity prices were included in
Accumulated other comprehensive income, or in operating income,
as appropriate. When a security is sold, the realized gain or
loss with respect to this security is then included in operating
income.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as
collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of
or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under
agreements to resell.

AIGFP owns inventories in certain commodities in which it
trades, and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the
use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. Physical
commodities held in AIGFP’s wholly owned broker-dealer
subsidiary are recorded at fair value. All other commodities are
recorded at the lower of cost or market value.

Trading securities, at fair value, and securities and spot
commodities sold but not yet purchased, at fair value, are
marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being
recognized in income at that time. These trading securities are
purchased and sold as necessary to meet the risk management
objectives of Capital Markets operations.

The gross unrealized gains and gross
unrealized losses of Capital Markets operations included in the
financial services assets and liabilities at December 31,
2006 were as follows:

The senior management of AIG defines the policies and
establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets
operations. AIG’s senior management has established various
oversight committees to monitor on an ongoing basis the various
financial market, operational and credit risks attendant to the
Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP
reports the results of its operations to and reviews future
strategies with AIG’s senior management.

while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportu-

nities. In doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a variety of
exposures, including credit, market, liquidity, operational and
legal risks.

Consumer Finance

AIG’s Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of
consumer finance products, including real estate and other
consumer loans, credit card loans, retail sales finance and
credit-related insurance to customers both domestically and
overseas, particularly in emerging markets. These products are
funded through a combination of deposits and various borrowings,
including commercial paper and medium-term notes. AIG’s
Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk
of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates.
Over half of the finance receivables are real estate loans which
are substantially collateralized by the related properties.

With respect to credit losses, the allowance for losses is
maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated
credit losses existing in that portfolio as of the balance sheet
date.

Asset Management Invested Assets

Asset Management invested assets are primarily comprised of
assets supporting AIG’s spread-based investment business,
which includes AIG’s MIP and domestic GIC programs as well
as AIG’s foreign spread-based business. Asset Management
invested assets also include assets attributable to certain
consolidated partnerships and variable interest entities. A
portion of these consolidated assets is offset by minority
interest liabilities attributable to unaffiliated investor
entities in AIG-sponsored investment vehicles.

The spread-based investment business strategy is to produce cash
flows greater than maturing liabilities. The asset-liability
relationship is managed actively, leveraging the
organization’s experience in the Life Insurance &
Retirement Services segment. Margins are emphasized while
maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. The
invested assets are predominantly fixed income securities for
the spread-based investment business.

Asset Management invested assets grew by $14.3 billion, or
20 percent during 2006, although aggregate Asset Management
fixed income investments remained essentially flat at
$37.7 billion. The growth in invested assets was primarily
attributable to increases in

short-term

investments,
securities lending collateral and real estate investments. These
increases were primarily driven by continued growth of the MIP
and AIG’s foreign spread-based business, and the growth of
AIG’s institutional Asset Management business. These
increases were partially offset by the decrease in assets
associated with the runoff of the domestic GIC program.

Valuation of Invested Assets

AIG has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its
stated maturity, including those fixed maturity securities
classified as available for sale. Therefore, the decision to
sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available
for sale reflects the judgment of AIG’s management that the
security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis,
as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities
entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed
securities, the sale decision reflects management’s
judgment that the risk-discounted anticipated ultimate recovery
is less than the value achievable on sale.

Traded Securities

The valuation of AIG’s investment portfolio involves
obtaining a market value for each security. The source for the
fair value is generally from market exchanges or dealer
quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities. AIG
considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income
investments, certain structured securities, direct private
equities, limited partnerships, and hedge funds.

Nontraded Securities

The aggregate carrying value of AIG’s nontraded securities
at December 31, 2006 was approximately $67 billion.
The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed
income investments is by reference to traded securities with
similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This
methodology takes into account such factors as the issuer’s
industry, the security’s rating and tenor, its coupon rate,
its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and other
relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a
component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.

For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based
on an estimate of the security’s future cash flows pursuant
to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No.

99-20,

“Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial
Assets.” The change in carrying value is recognized in
income.

Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the
aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair
value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of
Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.

With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which
AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest,
or less than a five percent interest but where AIG has more than
a minor influence over the operations of the investee, AIG
accounts for these investments using the equity method. The
changes in such net asset values are included in operating
income.

AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited
partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the
general partner or manager of each of these investments, the
accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis.

Each of these investment categories is regularly tested to
determine if impairment in value exists. Various valuation
techniques are used with respect to each category in this
determination.

Portfolio Review

AIG periodically evaluates its securities for
other-than-temporary impairments in valuation. As a matter of
policy, the determination that a security has incurred an
other-than-temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss
recognition requires the judgment of AIG’s management and a
continual review of its investments. See Note 1(e) of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
AIG’s policy.

Once a security has been identified as other-than-temporarily
impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by
reference to that security’s contemporaneous market price
and recorded as a charge to earnings.

As a result of these policies, AIG recorded, in realized capital
gains (losses), other-than-temporary impairment pretax losses of
$944 million, $598 million and $684 million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Just over half of
other-than-temporary impairment charges in 2006 were a result of
the decision not to hold these investment securities until they
fully recover in value. The writedowns recorded in 2005 and 2004
were primarily the result of adverse changes in the
creditworthiness of the issuer.

No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was
significant to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or
results of operations, and no individual impairment loss
exceeded 1.0 percent of consolidated net income for 2006.

Excluding the other-than-temporary impairments noted above, the
changes in fair value for AIG’s available for sale
portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIG’s
investments, were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive
income as unrealized gains or losses, net of tax.

At December 31, 2006, aggregate
pretax unrealized gains were $17.5 billion, while the
pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds,
non-investment grade bonds and equity securities were
$3.6 billion, $134 million and $159 million,
respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect
to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost
relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the fair value
is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number of
respective items, was as follows:

(a)

For bonds, represents amortized cost.

(b)

As more fully described above, upon realization, certain
    realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder
    accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in
    the amortization of DAC.

At December 31, 2006, the fair value of AIG’s fixed
maturities and equity securities aggregated $496.0 billion.
At December 31, 2006, aggregate unrealized gains after
taxes for fixed maturity and equity securities were
$11.4 billion. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate
unrealized losses after taxes of fixed maturity and equity
securities were approximately $2.5 billion.

The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will
be mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses
will be charged to participating policyholder accounts, or
realization will result in current decreases in the amortization
of certain DAC.

At December 31, 2006, unrealized losses for fixed maturity
securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant
industry concentrations.

The amortized cost of fixed maturities
available for sale in an unrealized loss position at
December 31, 2006, by contractual maturity, is shown

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the pretax realized

equity securities were $1.3 billion. The aggregate fair
value of securities sold was $43 billion, which was
approximately 97 percent of amortized cost. The average
period of time that securities sold at a loss during the year
ended December 31, 2006 were trading continuously at a
price below book value was approximately four months. See Risk
Management — Investments herein for an additional
discussion of investment risks associated with AIG’s
investment portfolio.

Risk Management

Overview

AIG believes that strong risk management practices and a sound
internal control environment are fundamental to its continued
success and profitable growth. Failure to manage risk properly
could expose AIG to significant losses, regulatory issues and a
damaged reputation.

The major risks to which AIG is exposed include the following:

•

Insurance risk

— the potential loss resulting
    from ultimate claims and expenses exceeding held reserves.

•

Credit risk

— the potential loss arising from
    an obligor’s inability or unwillingness to meet its
    obligations to AIG.

•

Market risk

— the potential loss arising from
    adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies,
    equity and commodity prices, and their levels of volatility.

•

Operational risk

— the potential loss resulting
    from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and
    systems, or from external events.

AIG senior management establishes the framework, principles and
guidelines for risk management. The business executives are
responsible for establishing and implementing risk management
processes and responding to the individual needs and issues
within their business, including risk concentrations within
their business segments.

Corporate Risk Management

AIG’s major risks are addressed at the corporate level
through the Enterprise Risk Management Department (ERM). ERM is
headed by AIG’s Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and is
responsible for assisting AIG’s business leaders, executive
management and the Board of Directors to identify, assess,
quantify, manage and mitigate the risks incurred by AIG. An
important goal of ERM is to ensure that once appropriate
governance, authorities, procedures and policies have been
established, aggregated risks do not result in inappropriate
concentrations.

Senior management defines the policies, has established general
operating parameters for its global businesses and has
established various oversight committees to monitor the risks
attendant to its businesses:

•

The Credit Risk Committee (CRC) is responsible for
    (i) approving credit risk policies and procedures for use
    throughout AIG; (ii) delegating credit authority to
    business unit credit officers and select business unit managers;
    (iii) approving transaction requests and limits for
    corporate, sovereign and cross-border credit exposures that
    exceed the delegated authorities; (iv) establishing and
    maintaining AIG’s risk rating process for corporate,
    financial and sovereign obligors; and (v) regular reviews
    of credit risk exposures in the portfolios of all
    credit-incurring business units.

•

The Financial Risk Committee (FRC) oversees AIG’s
    market risk exposures to interest rates, foreign exchange and
    equity prices and provides strategic direction for AIG’s
    asset-liability management. The FRC meets monthly and acts as a
    central mechanism for AIG senior management to review
    comprehensive information on AIG’s financial exposures and
    to exercise broad control over these exposures.

•

The Foreign Exchange Committee (FEC) monitors trends in
    foreign exchange rates, reviews AIG’s foreign exchange
    exposures, and provides recommendations on foreign currency
    asset allocation and remittance hedging.

•

The Derivatives Review Committee (DRC) provides an
    independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or
    program not otherwise managed by AIGFP. The DRC examines, among
    other things, the nature and purpose of the derivative
    transaction, its potential credit exposure, if any, and the
    estimated benefits.

•

The Complex Structured Finance Transaction Committee
    (CSFTC) has the authority and responsibility to review and
    approve proposed transactions that could subject AIG to
    heightened legal, reputational, accounting, or regulatory risk
    (CSFTs). The CSFTC provides guidance to and monitors the
    activities of transaction review committees (TRCs) which have
    been established in all major business units. TRCs have the
    responsibility to identify, review and refer CSFTs to the CSFTC.

Credit Risk Management

Credit risk is one of AIG’s largest single business risks
and AIG devotes considerable resources, expertise and controls
to managing its credit exposures. Credit risk is defined as the
risk that AIG’s customers or counterparties are unable or
unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they come
due. Credit risk may also be manifested: (i) through the
downgrading of credit ratings of counterparties whose credit
instruments AIG may be holding, or, in some cases, insuring,
causing the value of the assets to decline or insured risks to
rise and (ii) as cross-border risk where a country
(sovereign government risk) or one or more non-sovereign
obligors within a country are unable to repay an obligation or
are unable to provide foreign exchange to service a credit or
equity exposure incurred by another AIG business unit located
outside that country.

AIG’s credit risks are managed at the corporate level by
the Credit Risk Management Department (CRM) whose primary
role is to support and supplement the work of the CRC. CRM is
headed by AIG’s Chief Credit Officer (CCO), who reports to
AIG’s CRO. AIG’s CCO is primarily responsible for the
development and maintenance of credit risk policies and
procedures approved by the CRC. In discharging this function CRM
has the following responsibilities:

•

Manage the approval process for all requests for credit limits,
    program limits and transactions.

•

Approve delegated credit authorities to CRM credit executives
    and business unit credit officers.

•

Aggregate globally all credit exposure data by counterparty,
    country and industry and report risk concentrations regularly to
    the CRC.

•

Administer regular portfolio credit reviews of all investment,
    derivative and credit-incurring business units.

•

Develop methodologies for quantification and assessment of
    credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of
    AIG’s internal risk rating process.

•

Approve appropriate credit reserves and methodologies at the
    business unit and enterprise levels.

AIG closely monitors and controls its company-wide credit risk
concentrations and attempts to avoid unwanted or excessive risk
accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. To minimize the level
of credit risk in certain circumstances, AIG may require
collateral, guarantees and/or reinsurance support such as
letters of credit.

AIG defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as
the sum of its fixed maturities, loans, derivatives (mark to
market), deposits (in the case of financial institutions) and
the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance
products which embody credit risk.

The following table presents AIG’s
largest credit exposures at December 31, 2006 as a
percentage of total shareholders’ equity.

(a)

Risk rating is based on external ratings, or equivalent,
    based on AIG’s internal risk rating process.

(b)

Six are highly-rated financial institutions and three are
    investment-grade rated sovereigns; none is rated lower than BBB+
    or its equivalent.

AIG closely controls its aggregate cross-border exposures to
avoid excessive concentrations in any one country or regional
group of countries. AIG defines its cross-border exposure to
include both cross-border credit exposures and its large
cross-border investments in its own international subsidiaries.
Nine countries had cross-border exposures in excess of
10 percent of total shareholders’ equity; seven are
AAA-rated and two are AA-rated.

In addition, AIG closely monitors its industry concentrations,
the risks of which are often mitigated by the breadth and scope
of AIG’s international operations.

•

AIG’s single largest industry credit exposure is to the
    highly-rated global financial institutions sector, accounting
    for 72 percent of total shareholders’ equity at
    December 31, 2006.

•

AIG’s other industry credit concentrations in excess of
    10 percent of total shareholders’ equity at
    December 31, 2006 exist to the following industries (in
    descending order by approximate size):

– global telecommunications companies;

– U.S. residential mortgages;

– global life insurance carriers;

–

U.S.-based

regional financial institutions;

– U.S. commercial mortgages;

– global reinsurance firms; and

– global securities firms.

The CRC reviews quarterly concentration reports in all
categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk
ratings. The CRC may adjust limits to provide reasonable
assurance that AIG does not incur excessive levels of credit
risk and that AIG’s credit risk profile is properly
calibrated across business units.

Market Risk Management

AIG seeks to minimize market risks by matching the market risks
in its assets with the market risks in its liabilities.
Nevertheless, AIG does have net exposure to market risks,
primarily within its insurance businesses. These asset-liability
exposures are predominantly structural in nature, and not the
result of speculative positioning to take advantage of
short-term market opportunities. The Market Risk Management
Department (MRM), which reports to the CRO, is responsible for
control and oversight of market risks in all aspects of
AIG’s financial services, insurance, and investment
activities.

AIG’s market exposures arise from the following:

•

AIG is a globally diversified enterprise with capital deployed
    in a variety of currencies. Capital deployed in AIG’s
    overseas businesses, when converted into U.S. dollars for
    financial reporting purposes, constitutes a “long foreign
    currency/short U.S. dollar” market exposure on
    AIG’s balance sheet. Similarly, overseas earnings
    denominated in foreign currency also represent a “long
    foreign currency/short U.S. dollar” market exposure on
    AIG’s income statement.

•

Much of AIG’s domestic capital is invested in fixed income
    or equity securities, leading to exposures to U.S. yields
    and equity markets.

•

Several of AIG’s Foreign Life subsidiaries operate in
    developing markets where maturities on longer-term life
    insurance liabilities exceed the maximum maturities of available
    local currency assets.

AIG analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques
including Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical
measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of
market factors to calculate the maximum loss that could occur
over a defined period of time given a certain probability. VaR
measures not only the size of individual exposures but also the
interaction between different market exposures, thereby
providing a portfolio approach to measuring market risk.
Substantially similar VaR methodologies are used to determine
capital requirements for market risk within AIG’s economic
capital framework.

While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, their results are
limited by the assumptions and parameters used in these models.
AIG believes that statistical models alone do not provide a
reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk.
Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the
experience or judgment of senior management.

Insurance, Asset Management and
Non-Trading Financial Services VaR

AIG has performed one comprehensive VaR analysis across all of
its non-trading businesses, and a separate VaR analysis for its
trading business at AIGFP. The comprehensive VaR is categorized
by AIG business segment (General Insurance, Life
Insurance & Retirement Services, Financial Services and
Asset Management) and also by market risk factor (interest rate,
currency and equity).

For the insurance segments, assets included are invested assets
(excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued),
and liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss
expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits
for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other
policyholders’ funds. For financial services companies,
loans and leases represent the majority of assets represented in
the VaR calculation, while bonds and notes issued represent the
majority of liabilities.

AIG calculated the VaR with respect to net fair values as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005. The VaR number represents the
maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred
with a 95 percent confidence (i.e., only five percent of
historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure)
within a one-month holding period. AIG uses the historical
simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and
liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a
specific historical time period. AIG uses the most recent three
years of historical market information for interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices. For each
scenario, each transaction was repriced. Segment and AIG-wide
scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all
the underlying assets and liabilities.

The following table presents the
year-end, average, high and low VaRs on a diversified basis and
of each component of market risk for each of AIG’s
non-trading investments as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.
The diversified VaR is usually smaller than the sum of its
components due to correlation effects.

AIG’s total VaR declined from $5.2 billion at the end
of 2005 to $5.1 billion at the end of 2006, even as the
diversified VaR in each of the Insurance segments grew modestly.
Two factors contributed to the decline in total VaR. A reduction
in interest rate volatility in many currencies moderated
AIG’s interest rate risk profile, and higher correlations
between the long asset duration exposure in U.S. fixed
income and long liability duration exposures in many emerging
markets provided a greater diversification benefit during 2006.
Lower VaR figures in both the Financial Services and Asset
Management segments during 2006 were the result of a combination
of closer duration matching and a reduction of interest rate
volatility.

Operational Risk Management

AIG has established a corporate-level Operational Risk
Management Department (ORM) to oversee AIG’s
operational risk management practices. The Director of ORM
reports to the CRO. ORM is responsible for establishing the
framework, principles and guidelines for operational risk
management. This framework also utilizes the risk management
efforts of AIG’s compliance, legal and regulatory and
internal audit functions. ORM also manages compliance with the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Each business is responsible for implementing the components of
AIG’s operational risk management program to ensure that
effective operational risk management practices are utilized
throughout AIG. These components include governance, risk and
control self assessment, risk event data analysis, and key risk
indicators. The program currently incorporates the following:

•

Governance

Strong governance sets the appropriate tone to enable effective
management of the risks inherent in each of AIG’s
businesses, as well as aid in the management of reputational
risk. Each AIG business is responsible for maintaining
appropriate governance over its management of operational risk.
This respon-

sibility includes developing and implementing policies,
procedures, management oversight processes, and other
governance-related activities consistent with AIG’s overall
operational risk management process.

•

Risk and Control Self Assessment

AIG’s operational risk management program includes a self
assessment process. The self assessment process is used to
identify key operational risks in a business and evaluate the
effectiveness of existing controls to mitigate those risks, as
well as develop corrective action plans for identified
deficiencies.

Insurance Risk Management

Reinsurance

AIG uses reinsurance programs for its general insurance risks as
follows: (i) facultative to cover large individual
exposures; (ii) quota share treaties to cover specific
books of business; (iii) excess of loss treaties to cover
large losses; and (iv) catastrophe treaties to cover
certain catastrophes including earthquake, flood, wind and
terror. AIG’s Reinsurance Security Department conducts
periodic detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and
current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic.
Such assessments may include, but are not limited to,
identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has
sufficient financial capacity, and evaluating the local economic
environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates.

AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions, primarily
through AIRCO, for its General Insurance and Life
Insurance & Retirement Services operations. AIG enters
into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice
in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance
risk among AIG’s various legal entities. AIG generally
obtains letters of credit from third-party financial
institutions in order to obtain statutory recognition of these
intercompany reinsurance transactions. At December 31,
2006, approximately $4.0 billion of letters of credit were
outstanding to cover intercompany reinsurance transactions with
AIRCO or other General Insurance subsidiaries.

Although reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG
subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds, an
efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits
AIG’s exposure to potentially significant losses. AIG
continually evaluates the reinsurance markets and the relative
attractiveness of various arrangements for coverage, including
structures such as catastrophe bonds, insurance risk
securitizations and “sidecar” and similar vehicles.

Effective July 15, 2006, Lexington and Concord Re Limited
(Concord Re), a “sidecar” reinsurer that was
established exclusively to reinsure Lexington, entered into a
quota share reinsurance agreement covering the
U.S. commercial property insurance business written by
Lexington. Concord Re was capitalized with approximately
$730 million through the issuance of equity securities and
loans from third party investors. AIG and its subsidiaries
invest in a wide variety of investment vehicles managed by third
parties where AIG has no control over investment decisions.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such vehicles do
not, or will not, hold securities of Concord Re.

Reinsurance Recoverable

The Reinsurance Security Department reviews the nature of the
risks ceded to reinsurers and the requirements for credit risk
mitigants. For example, in AIG’s treaty reinsurance
contracts, AIG frequently includes provisions that require a
reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs.
Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers
through the use of credit triggers, which include, but are not
limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades,
declines in policyholders surplus below predetermined levels or
reaching maximum limits of reinsurance recoverable. In addition,
AIG’s CRC reviews all reinsurer exposures and credit limits
and approves most large reinsurer credit limits that represent
actual or potential credit concentrations. AIG believes that no
exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate
concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIG’s business
substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.

AIG’s consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to
$21.8 billion at December 31, 2006. AIG manages the
credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with
reinsurers that it considers financially sound, and when
necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form of funds,
securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral
can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified
time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At
December 31, 2006, approximately 54 percent of the
general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers.
Many of these balances were collateralized, permitting statutory
recognition. Additionally, with the approval of insurance
regulators, AIG posted approximately $2 billion of letters
of credit issued by commercial banks in favor of certain
Domestic General Insurance companies to permit those companies
statutory recognition of balances otherwise uncollateralized at
December 31, 2006. The remaining 46 percent of the
general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The
terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory
categories, not creditworthiness. At December 31, 2006,
approximately 85 percent of the balances with respect to
authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated A
(excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A
(strong) or better, as rated by S&P. These ratings are
measures of financial strength.

The following table provides
information for each reinsurer representing in excess of five
percent of AIG’s general reinsurance assets at
December 31, 2006.

(a)

Excludes collateral held in excess of applicable treaty
    balances.

(b)

Excludes Equitas gross reinsurance assets that are unrated,
    which are less than five percent of AIG’s general
    reinsurance assets.

At December 31, 2006, consolidated general reinsurance
assets of $21.8 billion include reinsurance recoverables
for paid losses and loss expenses of $1.0 billion and
$17.3 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses
and loss expenses, including ceded losses IBNR (ceded reserves)
and $3.5 billion of ceded reserve for unearned premiums.
The ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses represent the
accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including
provisions for ceded IBNR and loss expenses. The methods used to
determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded
reserves involve significant judgment in projecting the
frequency and severity of losses over multiple years and are
continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments
thereto are reflected in income currently. It is AIG’s
belief that the ceded reserves for losses and loss expenses at
December 31, 2006 were representative of the ultimate
losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded reserves
continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate loss
recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently
ceded.

AIG maintains an allowance for estimated unrecoverable
reinsurance of $536 million. The allowance was reduced
substantially during 2006, as uncollectible amounts due from
individual reinsurers were charged off against the allowance,
primarily as a result of the balance sheet reconciliation
remediation process; in addition, a portion of the allowance was
reclassified to align it with the related receivable. The
reduction for charge offs was partially offset by additional
provisions totaling $147 million during 2006. At
December 31, 2006, AIG had no significant reinsurance
recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was
financially troubled (i.e., liquidated, insolvent, in
receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal
regulatory restriction).

Segment Risk Management

Other than as described above, AIG manages its business risk
oversight activities through its business segments.

Insurance Operations

AIG’s multiple insurance businesses conducted on a global
basis expose AIG to a wide variety of risks with different time
horizons. These risks are managed throughout the organization,
both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures,
including: (i) pre-launch approval of product design,
development and distribution; (ii) underwriting approval
processes and authorities; (iii) exposure limits with
ongoing monitoring; (iv) modeling and reporting of
aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels
(policy, line of business, product group, country,
individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);
(v) compliance with financial reporting and capital and
solvency targets; (vi) extensive use of reinsurance, both
internal and third-party; and (vii) review and
establishment of reserves.

AIG has two major categories of insurance risks as follows:

•

General Insurance

— risks covered include
    property, casualty, fidelity/surety, management liability and
    mortgage insurance. Risks in the general insurance segment are
    managed through aggregations and limitations of concentrations
    at multiple levels: policy, line of business, correlation and
    catastrophic risk events.

•

Life Insurance & Retirement Services

—
    risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented
    products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract
    liabilities in the retirement savings-oriented products. In the
    Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment, risk is
    aggregated and limited by individual/group, product group,
    country and catastrophic risk events.

AIG closely manages insurance risk by overseeing and controlling
the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of
business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the
underwriting and the premiums charged for taking on the risk.
Concentrations of risk primarily arise from external events,
such as wind, flood, earthquake, terrorism and pandemics, which
are analyzed using various modeling techniques.

AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its insurance
operations. The use of reinsurance facilitates insurance risk
management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital
planning locally (branch and subsidiary). Pooling of AIG’s
reinsurance risks enables AIG to purchase reinsurance more
efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty
risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks, both
for the General Insurance and Life Insurance &
Retirement Services businesses.

General Insurance

In General Insurance, underwriting risks are managed through the
application approval process, exposure limitations as well as
through exclusions, coverage limits and reinsurance. The risks
covered by AIG are managed through limits on delegated under-

Continued

writing authority, the use of sound underwriting practices,
pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis as part of
the determination of overall adequacy of provisions for
insurance contract liabilities.

A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance
operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this
goal, AIG must be disciplined in its risk selection, and
premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate
to cover the risk accepted.

Catastrophe Exposures

The nature of AIG’s business exposes it to various
catastrophic risk events in which multiple losses across
multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year. In
order to control this exposure, AIG uses a combination of
techniques, including setting aggregate limits in key business
units, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and
purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other
reinsurance protections.

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other
catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIG’s
operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a
pandemic disease, such as the Avian Influenza A Virus (H5N1),
could adversely affect AIG’s business and operating results
to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance
programs.

AIG evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability
of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the
use of

state-of

-the-art
industry recognized models, among other techniques. AIG
supplements these models by periodically monitoring the risk
exposure of AIG’s worldwide General Insurance operations
and adjusting such models accordingly. Following is an overview
of modeled losses associated with the more significant natural
perils, which includes exposures for DBG, Personal Lines,
Foreign General (other than Ascot), HSB and 21st Century.
Transatlantic and Ascot utilize a different model, and their
combined results are presented separately below. The modeled
results assume that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to
AIG in accordance with their terms.

It is important to recognize that there is no standard
methodology to project the possible losses from total property
and workers compensation exposures. Further, there are no
industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these
losses. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could
materially change the projected losses. Therefore, these modeled
losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other
companies.

These estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect
AIG’s maximum exposures to these events. It is highly
likely that AIG’s losses will vary, perhaps significantly,
from these estimates.

The modeled results provided in the table below were based on
the aggregate exceedence probability (AEP) losses which
represent total property and workers compensation losses that
may occur in any single year from one or more natural events.
The model, which has been updated to reflect 2005 catastrophes,
generally used exposure data as of mid-year 2006 and the current
reinsurance program structure. The values provided were based on

100-year

return period
losses, which have a one percent likelihood of being exceeded in
any single year. Thus, the model projects that there is a one
percent probability that AIG could incur in any year losses in
excess of the modeled amounts for these perils.

In addition, AIG evaluates potential single event earthquake and
hurricane losses that may be incurred. The single events
utilized are a subset of potential events identified and
utilized by
Lloyd’s

(1)

and referred to as Realistic Disaster Scenarios (RDSs). The
purpose of this analysis is to utilize these RDSs to provide a
reference frame and place into context the model results.
However, it is important to note that the specific events used
for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case
loss that AIG could incur from this type of an event in these
regions. The losses associated with the RDSs are included in the
table below.

Single event modeled property and workers compensation losses

application of policy limits and deductibles, and net values
represent losses after all reinsurance is applied.

The specific international RDS events do not necessarily
correspond to AIG’s international exposures. As a result,
AIG runs its own simulations where statistical return period
losses associated with the written exposure specific to AIG
provide the basis for monitoring risk. Based on these
simulations, the

100-year

return period
for Japanese Earthquake is $296 million gross, and
$120 million net, the

100-year

return period
for European Windstorm is $269 million gross, and
$80 million net, and the

100-year

return period
for Japanese Typhoon is $306 million gross, and
$252 million net.

ACTUAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD ARE LIKELY TO VARY, PERHAPS
MATERIALLY, FROM THE MODELED SCENARIOS, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF
ONE OR MORE SEVERE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
ON AIG’S FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
LIQUIDITY.

Measures Implemented to Control
Hurricane and Earthquake Catastrophic Risk

Catastrophic risk from the earthquake and hurricane perils is
proactively managed through reinsurance programs, and aggregate
accumulation monitoring. Catastrophe reinsurance is purchased by
AIG from financially sound reinsurers. Recoveries under this
program, along with other non-catastrophic reinsurance
protections, are reflected in the net values provided in the
tables above. In addition to catastrophic reinsurance programs,
hurricane and earthquake exposures are controlled by
periodically monitoring aggregate exposures. The aggregate
exposures are calculated by compiling total liability within AIG
defined hurricane and earthquake catastrophe risk zones and
therefore represent the maximum that could be lost in any
individual zone. These aggregate accumulations are tracked over
time in order to monitor both long and short term trends.
AIG’s major property writers, Lexington and AIG private
client group, have also implemented catastrophe-related
underwriting procedures and manage their books at an account
level. Lexington individually models most accounts prior to
binding in order to specifically quantify catastrophic risk for
each account.

Terrorism

Exposure to loss from terrorist attack is controlled by limiting
the aggregate accumulation of workers compensation and property
insurance that is underwritten within defined target locations.
Modeling is used to provide projections of probable maximum loss
by target location based upon the actual exposures of AIG
policyholders.

Terrorism risk is monitored to manage AIG’s exposure. AIG
shares its exposures to terrorism risks under the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Act (TRIA). During 2006, AIG’s deductible under
TRIA was approximately $3.3 billion, with a 10 percent
share of certified terrorism losses in excess of the deductible.
As of January 1, 2007, the deductible increased to
approximately $4.0 billion, with a 15 percent share of
certified terrorism losses in excess of the deductible. Without
an extension by Congress, TRIA will sunset at December 31,
2007. Should TRIA not be renewed, AIG would expect to reassess
and modify its underwriting guidelines and retention levels as
appropriate.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services

In Life Insurance & Retirement Services, the primary
risks are (i) underwriting, which represents the exposure
to loss resulting from the actual policy experience emerging
adversely in comparison to the assumptions made in the product
pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and
expenses; and (ii) investment risk which represents the
exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested
assets being less than the cash flows required to meet the
obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and
the necessary return on investments. AIG businesses manage these
risks through exposure limitations and the active management of
the asset-liability relationship in their operations. The
emergence of significant adverse experience would require an
adjustment to DAC and benefit reserves that could have a
material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for a particular period.

AIG’s Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services
companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on
life insurance of a single life to approximately
$1.7 million of coverage. AIG’s Domestic Life
Insurance & Retirement Services companies limit their
maximum underwriting exposure on life insurance of a single life
to $10 million of coverage in certain circumstances by
using yearly renewable term reinsurance. In Life
Insurance & Retirement Services, the reinsurance
programs provide risk mitigation per policy, per individual life
and group covers and for catastrophic risk events.

Pandemic Influenza

The potential for a pandemic influenza outbreak has received
much recent attention. While outbreaks of the Avian Flu continue
to occur among poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in
Asia, Europe, including the U.K., and Africa, transmission to
humans has been rare to date. If the virus mutates to a form
that can be transmitted from human to human, it has the
potential to spread rapidly worldwide. If such an outbreak were
to take place, early quarantine and vaccination could be
critical to containment.

The contagion and mortality rates of any mutated H5N1 virus that
can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative.
AIG continues to monitor the developing facts. A significant
global outbreak could have a material adverse effect on Life
Insurance & Retirement Services operating results and
liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates. AIG
continues to analyze its exposure to this serious threat and has
engaged an external risk management firm to model loss scenarios
associated with an outbreak of Avian Flu. Using a 1 in

100-year

return period,
AIG estimates its after-tax net losses under its life insurance
policies due to Avian Flu at less than 1 percent of
consolidated shareholders’ equity as of December 31,
2006. This estimate was calculated over a

3-year

period, although
the majority of the losses would be incurred in the first year.
The modeled losses calculated were based on 2005 policy data
representing approximately 90 percent of AIG’s
individual life, group life and credit life books of business,
net of reinsurance. This estimate does not include claims that
could be made under other policies, such as business
interruption or general liability

policies, and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting
from disruption of AIG’s own business operations that may
arise out of such a pandemic. The model used to generate this
estimate has only recently been developed. The reasonableness of
the model and its underlying assumptions cannot readily be
verified by reference to comparable historical events. As a
result, AIG’s actual losses from a pandemic influenza
outbreak are likely to vary significantly from those predicted
by the model.

Investments

AIG’s fixed maturity investments totaled
$417.9 billion at December 31, 2006, compared to
$385.7 billion at December 31, 2005. AIG’s
investment strategies are tailored to the specific business
needs of each operating unit based on considerations that
include the local market, liability duration and cash flow
characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital
considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization,
diversification and credit limits. These strategies are intended
to produce a reasonably stable and predictable return throughout
the economic cycle, without undue risk or volatility.

At December 31, 2006, approximately 57 percent of the
fixed maturities investments were domestic securities.
Approximately 39 percent of such domestic securities were
rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies.
Approximately five percent were below investment grade or not
rated.

A significant portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is
rated by Moody’s, S&P or similar foreign rating
services. Rating services are not available in all overseas
locations. The CRC closely reviews the credit quality of the
foreign portfolio’s non-rated fixed income investments. At
December 31, 2006, approximately 20 percent of the
foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA or, on
the basis of AIG’s internal analysis, were equivalent from
a credit standpoint to securities so rated. Approximately five
percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date. A
large portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is sovereign
fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in
the country of issuance.

The credit ratings of fixed maturity
investments, other than those of AIGFP, at December 31,
2006 were

AIG uses asset-liability matching as a management tool worldwide
in the life insurance business to determine the composition of
the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies.
AIG’s objective is to maintain a matched asset-liability
structure. However, in certain markets, the absence of
long-dated fixed income instruments may preclude a matched
asset-liability position in those markets. In addition, AIG may
occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to
be temporarily in an unmatched position.

Financial Services

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified
activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance.

Aircraft Leasing

AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations
of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new
and used commercial jet aircraft to scheduled and charter
airlines and companies associated with the airline industry.
Risks inherent in this business, and which are managed at the
business unit level, include: (i) the risk that there will
be no market for the aircraft acquired; (ii) the risk that
aircraft cannot be placed with lessees; (iii) the risk of
nonperformance by lessees; and (iv) the risk that aircraft
and related assets cannot be disposed of at the time and in a
manner desired.

Capital Markets

The Capital Markets operations of AIG are conducted primarily
through AIGFP, which engages as principal in standard and
customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy
and credit products with top-tier corporations, financial
institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors and
high-net-worth individuals throughout the world.

The senior management of AIG defines the policies and
establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets
operations. AIG’s senior management has established various
oversight committees to monitor on an ongoing basis the various
financial market, operational and credit risk attendant to the
Capital Markets operations. The senior management of AIGFP
reports the results of its operations to and reviews future
strategies with AIG’s senior management.

AIGFP actively manages its exposures to limit potential losses,
while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business
opportunities. In doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a
variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity,
operational and legal risks.

AIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary
course of its business. The majority of AIGFP’s credit
derivatives require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a
designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. AIGFP provides
such credit protection on a “second loss” basis, under
which AIGFP’s payment obligations arise only after credit
losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold
amount or level of “first losses.” The threshold
amount of credit losses that must be realized before AIGFP has
any payment obligation is negotiated by AIGFP for each
transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment
obligation by AIGFP under each transaction is remote, even in
severe recessionary market scenarios.

In certain cases, the credit risk associated with a designated
portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk, which are
then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies.
Typically, there

94       AIG


Form

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in
respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the
total portfolio, and then successive layers that are rated,
generally a BBB-rated layer, an A-rated layer, an AA-rated
layer, and one or more AAA-rated layers. In transactions that
are rated, the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior
to the threshold level above which AIGFP’s payment
obligation would generally arise is rated AAA by the rating
agencies. In transactions that are not rated, AIGFP applies the
same risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its
payment obligations. Therefore, the risk layer assumed by AIGFP
with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions
is often called the “super senior” risk layer, defined
as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been
rated AAA by the credit rating agencies, or if the transaction
is not rated, equivalent thereto.

AIGFP continually monitors the underlying portfolios to
determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular
portfolio has caused the likelihood of AIGFP having a payment
obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior
risk. AIGFP maintains the ability opportunistically to
economically hedge specific securities in a portfolio and
thereby further limit its exposure to loss and has hedged
outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion. At
December 31, 2006, the notional amount with respect to the
Capital Markets credit derivative portfolio (including the super
senior transactions) was $483.6 billion.

Financial Services securities available for sale is
predominately a diversified portfolio of high grade fixed income
securities. At December 31, 2006, the average credit rating
of this portfolio was in the AA+ category or the equivalent
thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal
review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative
transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated
with $128 million of these securities. Securities deemed
below investment grade at December 31, 2006 amounted to
approximately $340 million in fair value representing
0.7 percent of the total AIGFP securities available for
sale. There have been no significant downgrades through
February 15, 2007. If its securities available for sale
portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral
held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the
credit default swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could
have a liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFP’s payment
obligations, including its debt obligations.

AIGFP’s management objective is to minimize interest rate,
currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its
securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a
security for its securities available for sale investment
portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal
hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction
offset the payment terms of the investment security, which
achieves the economic result of converting the return on the
underlying security to U.S. dollar LIBOR plus or minus a
spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the
initial trade date. The market risk associated with such
internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with
third-party hedging transactions executed as necessary. These
hedging activities did not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as
collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of
or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under
agreements to resell.

A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a
derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending
credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit
risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a
positive fair value to AIG. The maximum potential exposure will
increase or decrease during the life of the derivative
commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. To
help manage this risk, AIGFP’s credit department operates
within the guidelines set by the CRC. Transactions which fall
outside these pre-established guidelines require the specific
approval of the CRC. It is also AIG’s policy to establish
reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary.

In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements,
including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit
triggers, credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the
credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative
transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection
with specific transactions based on, among other things, the
creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the
transaction’s size and maturity. Furthermore, AIGFP
generally seeks to enter into agreements that have the benefit
of set-off and close-out netting provisions. These provisions
provide that, in the case of an early termination of a
transaction, AIGFP can set-off its receivables from a
counterparty against its payables to the same counterparty
arising out of all covered transactions. As a result, where a
legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of
the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of
estimated positive fair values. The fair value of AIGFP’s
interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, options,
swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward
contracts approximated $19.25 billion at December 31,
2006 and $18.70 billion at December 31, 2005. Where
applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance
with the respective close-out netting provisions.

AIGFP independently evaluates the counterparty credit quality by
reference to ratings from rating agencies or, where such ratings
are not available, by internal analysis consistent with the risk
rating policies of the CRC. In addition, AIGFP’s credit
approval process involves pre-set counterparty and country
credit exposure limits and, for particularly credit-intensive
transactions, requires approval from the CRC. AIG estimates that
the average credit rating of Capital Markets derivatives
counterparties, measured by reference to the fair value of its
derivative portfolio as a whole, is equivalent to the AA rating
category.

Capital Markets Trading VaR

AIGFP maintains a very conservative market risk profile and
minimizes risk in interest rates, equities, commodities and
foreign exchange. Market exposures in option implied
volatilities, correlations and basis risks are also minimized
over time but those are the main types of market risks that
AIGFP manages. As a result, AIGFP’s operating income due to
changes in market prices and rates is generally a very small
percentage of its overall operating income.

AIGFP’s minimal reliance on market risk driven revenue is
reflected in its VaR. AIGFP’s VaR calculation is based on
the interest rate, equity, commodity and foreign exchange risk
arising from its portfolio. Because the market risk with respect
to securities available for sale, at market, is substantially
hedged, segregation of the financial instruments into trading
and other than trading was not deemed necessary.

In the calculation of VaR for AIGFP, AIG uses the historical
simulation methodology that entails repricing all transactions
under explicit changes in market rates within a specific
historical time period. AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and
independent current market prices, such as published exchange
prices, external subscription services such as Bloomberg or
Reuters, or third-party broker quotes. When such prices are not
available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes
extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to
the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have
not deviated from these models in any material respect.

AIGFP reports its VaR using a 95 percent confidence
interval and a one-day holding period, facilitating risk
comparison with AIGFP’s trading peers and reflecting the
fact that market risks can be actively assumed and offset in
AIGFP’s trading portfolio.

The following table presents the
year-end, average, high, and low VaRs on a diversified basis and
of each component of market risk for Capital Markets operations
for the years 2006 and 2005. The diversified VaR is usually
smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation
effects.

Consumer Finance

AIG’s Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of
consumer finance products, including real estate and other
consumer loans, credit card loans, retail sales finance and
credit-related insurance to customers both domestically and
overseas, particularly in emerging markets. Consumer Finance
operations include AGF as well as AIGCFG. AGF provides a wide
variety of consumer finance products, including real estate
loans, non-real estate loans, retail sales finance and
credit-related insurance to customers in the United States,
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AIGCFG, through
its subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi-product
consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets.

Many of AGF’s borrowers are non-prime or sub-prime. Current
economic conditions, such as interest rate and employment
levels, can have a direct effect on the borrowers’ ability
to repay these loans. AGF manages the credit risk inherent in
its portfolio by using credit scoring models at the time of
credit applications, established underwriting criteria, and, in
certain cases, individual loan reviews. AGF monitors the quality
of the finance receivables portfolio and determines the
appropriate level of the allowance for losses through its Credit
Strategy and Policy Committee. This Committee bases its
conclusions on quantitative analyses, qualitative factors,
current economic conditions and trends, and each Committee
member’s experience in the consumer finance industry.
Through 2006, the credit quality of AGF’s finance
receivables continued to be strong. However, declines in the
strength of the U.S. housing market or economy may
adversely affect the future credit quality of these receivables.

AIGCFG monitors the quality of its finance receivable portfolio
and determines the appropriate level of the allowance for losses
through several internal committees. These committees base their

96       AIG


Form

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

conclusions on quantitative analysis, qualitative factors,
current economic conditions and trends, political and regulatory
implications, competition and the judgment of the
committees’ members.

AIG’s Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit
risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in
interest rates and payment defaults. Credit loss exposure is
managed through a combination of underwriting controls, mix of
finance receivables, collateral and collection efficiency. Large
product programs are subject to CRC approval.

Over half of the finance receivables are real estate loans which
are collateralized by the related properties. With respect to
credit losses, the allowance for losses is maintained at a level
considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing
in that portfolio as of the balance sheet date.

Asset Management

AIG’s Asset Management operations are exposed to various
forms of credit, market and operational risks. Asset Management
complies with AIG’s corporate risk management guidelines
and framework and is subject to periodic reviews by the CRC. In
addition, transactions are referred to the Asset Management
investment committees for approval of investment decisions.

The majority of the credit and market risk exposures within
Asset Management results from the spread-based investment
business and the investment activities of AIG Global Real Estate
Investment Corp.

In the spread-based investment businesses, GIC and MIP, the
primary risk is investment risk, which represents the exposure
to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets
being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations
of the liabilities and the necessary return on investments.
Credit risk is also a significant component of the investment
strategy for these businesses. Market risk is taken in the form
of duration and convexity risk. While AIG generally maintains a
matched asset-liability relationship, it may occasionally
determine that it is economically advantageous to be in an
unmatched duration position. The risks in the spread-based
businesses are managed through exposure limitations, active
management of the investment portfolios and close oversight of
the asset-liability relationship.

Within AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp., AIG is exposed
to the general conditions in global real estate markets and the
credit markets. Such exposure can subject Asset Management to
delays in real estate sales, additional carrying costs and in
turn affect operating results within the segment. These risks
are mitigated through the underwriting process, transaction and
contract terms and conditions and portfolio diversification by
type of project, sponsor, real estate market and country.
AIG’s exposure to real estate investments is monitored on
an ongoing basis by the Asset Management real estate investment
committee.

Economic Capital

Since mid 2005, AIG has been developing a firm-wide economic
capital model to improve decision making and to enhance
shareholder value. Economic Capital is the amount of capital the
organization, its segments, profit centers, products or
transactions require to cover potential, unexpected losses
within a confidence level consistent with the risk profile
selected by management. The Economic Capital requirement can
then be compared with the economic capital resources available
to AIG.

The Economic Capital requirement is driven by exposures to risks
and correlations among various types of risks. As a global
financial conglomerate, AIG is exposed to various risks
including underwriting, financial and operational risks. The
Economic Capital initiative has modeled these risks into five
major categories: property & casualty insurance risk,
life insurance risk, market risk, credit risk and operational
risk. Within each risk category, there are sub-risks that have
been modeled in greater detail. The Economic Capital initiative
also analyzes and includes diversification benefits within and
across risk categories and business segments.

A primary objective of the Economic Capital initiative is to
develop a comprehensive framework to discuss capital and
performance on a risk-adjusted basis internally with AIG
management and externally with the investment community, credit
providers, regulators and rating agencies. Economic Capital
analysis provides a framework to validate AIG’s capital
adequacy, to measure more precisely capital efficiency at
various levels throughout the organization, to allocate capital
consistently among AIG’s businesses, to quantify the
specific areas of diversification benefits and to assess
relative economic value added by a business, product or
transaction to AIG as a whole. The Economic Capital initiative
will also be a component in developing a more efficient capital
structure. Other key areas of Economic Capital applications
include strategic decision-making for mergers, acquisitions and
divestitures, risk retention, reinsurance and hedging strategies
and product development and pricing.

During 2006, AIG developed a methodology framework that
incorporates financial services industry best practices,
maintains consistency with regulatory frameworks and reflects
AIG’s distinct global business and management strategies.
By utilizing stochastic simulation techniques, where
appropriate, AIG enhanced existing models or developed new ones
through a collaborative effort among business executives,
actuaries, finance specialists and risk professionals. Initial
assessments of Economic Capital were made and AIG began
reviewing its economic capital model methodology with the rating
agencies.

The initial assessments were made at the corporate, segment and
major business unit level, and detailed analyses of selected
businesses and products were undertaken. AIG also developed
assessments of diversification benefits across lines of
business, geographic regions and risk categories. Given the
breadth and global nature of AIG’s businesses, these
benefits were found to be significant.

The initial assessments have provided useful insight into the
overall capital strength of the corporation and its segments
and, to date, the initiative has introduced guidance concerning
processes to assess economic risk and returns for selected
issues, including funding and investment strategies for the MIP,
product development, pricing, hedging for living benefits in the
variable annuity business and asset-liability management
strategies for life insurance products, particularly in Asian
markets.

Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (FAS 158).

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 159, “The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities” (FAS 159).

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of

American International Group, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of American International
Group, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated Financial Statements and
Financial Statement Schedules

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of American International Group, Inc. and
its subsidiaries (AIG) at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
AIG’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As described in Notes 1, 14 and 15 to the consolidated
financial statements, AIG changed its accounting for certain
hybrid financial instruments, life settlement contracts and
share based compensation as of January 1, 2006, and certain
employee benefit plans as of December 31, 2006.

Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Also, we have audited management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that AIG did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006 because of the effect of the material
weakness relating to controls over income tax accounting, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). AIG’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of AIG’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of
December 31, 2006, a material weakness relating to the
controls over income tax accounting has been identified and
included in management’s assessment.

Controls over income tax accounting:

AIG did not
maintain effective controls over the determination and reporting
of certain components of the provision for income taxes and
related income tax balances. Specifically, AIG did not maintain
effective controls to review and monitor the accuracy of the
components of the income tax provision calculations and related
income tax balances and to monitor the differences between the
income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and
liabilities to effectively

100       AIG

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

Continued

reconcile the differences to the deferred income tax balances.
These control deficiencies resulted in adjustments to income tax
expense, income taxes payable and deferred income tax asset and
liability accounts in the 2006 annual and interim consolidated
financial statements. Furthermore, these control deficiencies
could result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim
AIG consolidated financial statements that would not be
prevented or detected. Accordingly, AIG management has concluded
that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.

This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
2006 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion
regarding the effectiveness of AIG’s internal control over
financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AIG did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.
Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material
weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of
the control criteria, AIG has not maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
AIG and its majority owned subsidiaries. AIG consolidates
subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling financial interest.
Entities that AIG does not consolidate but of which it holds 20
percent to 50 percent of the voting rights and/or has the
ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for
under the equity method.

Certain of AIG’s foreign subsidiaries included in the
consolidated financial statements report on a fiscal year ending
November 30. The effect on AIG’s consolidated
financial condition and results of operations of all material
events occurring after November 30 and prior to the
applicable balance sheet date has been recorded.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.

Description of Business

See Note 2 herein for a description of AIG’s
businesses.

Use of Estimates

AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates to be those
with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future
policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts,
recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC),
estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products, fair
value determinations for certain Capital Markets assets and
liabilities, other-than-temporary declines in the value of
investments and flight equipment recoverability.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ, possibly materially, from those estimates.

Revisions and Reclassifications

It was determined during 2006 that for certain deferred sales
inducement assets, the asset and related amortization expense
had historically been reported within deferred policy
acquisition costs on the consolidated balance sheet and income
statement. Under Statement of Position

03-1,

“Accounting
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
Accounts” (SOP

03-1),

such assets
should be classified separately from DAC and the amortization
reported in benefit expense. Accordingly, the December 31,
2005 consolidated balance sheet reflects a revision of
$1.1 billion from DAC to other assets, and the consolidated
income statement includes a revision from acquisition expense to
policy benefit expense of $153 million and
$149 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, to conform to the current year’s
presentation. This revision did not have any effect on
consolidated pre-tax income, net income or shareholders’
equity.

In 2006 AIG determined that certain products that were
historically reported as separate account assets under SOP

03-1

should have been
reported as general account assets. Accordingly, AIG revised the
classification of approximately $2.7 billion of assets from
separate account assets in prior years to general account
assets, and the same amount of liabilities from separate account
liabilities to policyholders’ contract deposits at
December 31, 2006. As a result, Net investment income and
Incurred policy losses and benefits each increased approximately
$258 million for the earnings on the general account assets
that accrue directly to the benefit of the policyholders. This
revision did not have any effect on consolidated income before
income taxes, net income, or shareholders’ equity for any
period presented.

Certain reclassifications and format changes have been made to
prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

Accounting Policies

(a) Revenue Recognition and Expenses:

Premiums and other Considerations:

Premiums for short
duration contracts and considerations received from retailers in
connection with the sale of extended service contracts are
earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the
related coverage. The reserve for unearned premium includes the
portion of premiums written and other considerations relating to
the unexpired terms of coverage. Premiums for long duration
insurance products and life contingent annuities are recognized
as revenues when due. Estimates for premiums due but not yet
collected are accrued. Consideration for universal life and
investment-type products consist of policy charges for the cost
of insurance, administration, and surrenders during the period.
Policy charges collected with respect to future services are
deferred and recognized in a manner similar to DAC related to
such products.

Net Investment Income:

Net investment income represents
income primarily from the following sources in AIG’s
insurance operations:

•

Accrued interest income, as well as amortization and accretion
    of premiums and discounts on bonds.

•

Dividend income and distributions from common and preferred
    stock and other investments when receivable.

•

Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading
    securities and hybrid financial instruments.

•

Earnings from hedge funds and limited partnership investments
    accounted for under the equity method.

•

The difference between the carrying amount of a life settlement
    contract and the life insurance proceeds of the underlying life
    insurance policy recorded in income upon the death of the
    insured.

1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Continued

Realized Capital Gains (Losses):

Realized capital gains
and losses are determined principally by specific
identification. The realized capital gains and losses are
generated primarily from the following sources (in AIG’s
insurance operations and Other category):

•

Sales of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, real
    estate, investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships
    and other types of investments.

•

Reductions to the cost basis of fixed maturities, equity
    securities and other invested assets for other-than-temporary
    impairments.

•

Changes in fair value of derivatives used for other than hedging
    activities.

•

Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
    transactions.

Other Income:

Other income includes income from flight
equipment, finance charges on consumer loans and income
generated from asset management activities and from the
operations of AIGFP.

Income from flight equipment under operating leases is
recognized over the life of the lease as rentals become
receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of
leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method
over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases,
leases provide for additional payments contingent on usage.
Rental income is recognized at the time such usage occurs less a
provision for future contractual aircraft maintenance. Gains and
losses on flight equipment are recognized when flight equipment
is sold and the risk of ownership of the equipment is passed to
the new owner.

Finance charges on consumer loans are recognized as revenue
using the interest method. Revenue ceases to be accrued when
contractual payments are not received for four consecutive
months for loans and retail sales contracts, and for six months
for revolving retail accounts and private label receivables.
Extension fees, late charges, and prepayment penalties are
recognized as revenue when received.

Income generated with respect to asset management operations is
generally recognized as revenues as services are performed.
Certain costs incurred in the sale of mutual funds are deferred
and subsequently amortized.

Income generated from the operations of AIGFP includes the
following:

•

Accrued interest income and expense, as well as amortization and
    accretion of premiums and discounts on bonds.

•

Dividend income and distributions from common and preferred
    stock and other investments when receivable.

•

Changes in the fair value of derivatives. In certain instances,
    no initial gain or loss is recognized in accordance with
    Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
    No.

02-3,

“Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts
    held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy
    Trading and Risk Management Activities”
    (EITF

02-3).

The
    initial gain or loss is recognized over the life of the
    transactions and as observable market data becomes available.

•

Unrealized gains and losses from trading securities, commodities
    sold, but not yet purchased, futures and hybrid financial
    instruments.

•

Realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale
    securities and investments in private equities, joint ventures
    and limited partnerships.

•

Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
    transactions.

•

Reductions to the cost basis of equity securities for
    other-than-temporary impairments.

•

Earnings from hedge funds and limited partnership investments
    accounted for under the equity method.

Incurred policy losses and
benefits:

Incurred policy losses for short duration
insurance contracts consist of the estimated ultimate cost of
settling claims incurred within the reporting period, including
incurred but not reported claims, plus the changes in estimates
of current and prior period losses resulting from the continuous
review process. Benefits for long duration insurance contracts
consist of benefits paid and changes in future policy benefits
liabilities. Benefits for universal life and investment-type
products primarily consists of interest credited to policy
account balances and benefit payments made in excess of policy
account balances.

(b) Foreign Currency:

Financial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 52, “Foreign
Currency Translation” (FAS 52). Under FAS 52,
functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective
subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded
as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of
any related taxes, in consolidated shareholders’ equity.
Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local
operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in
functional currencies are translated using average exchange
rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial
statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary
economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in
income currently.

(c) Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effects
of temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or
liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial
statements. AIG assesses its ability to realize deferred tax
assets primarily based on the earnings history, future earnings
potential, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and
the tax planning strategies available to the legal entities
recognizing deferred tax assets, in accordance with
FAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” See
Note 3 herein for a further discussion of income taxes.

(d) Contingencies:

Amounts are accrued for the financial resolution of claims that
have either been asserted or are deemed probable of assertion
if, in the opinion of management, it is both probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount

Form

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

Continued

of the liability can be reasonably estimated. In many cases, it
is not possible to determine whether a liability has been
incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that
liability until years after the contingency arises, in which
case no accrual is made until that time.

(e) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity
Securities:

Bonds held to
maturity are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries and
are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and
positive intent to hold these securities until maturity.

Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold bonds until
maturity and such securities are not designated as trading,
these securities are considered to be available for sale and
carried at current fair values.

Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds are
treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives, until
maturity, or call date, if applicable.

Bond trading securities are carried at current fair values.

Common and preferred stocks are carried at current fair values.

AIG may also enter into dollar roll agreements. These are
agreements to sell mortgage-backed securities and to repurchase
substantially similar securities at a specified price and date
in the future. At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there
were no dollar roll agreements outstanding.

Unrealized gains and losses from available for sale investments
in equity and fixed maturity securities are reflected as a
separate component of other comprehensive income, net of
deferred income taxes currently. Unrealized gains and losses
from investments in trading securities are reflected in income
currently. Investments in fixed maturities and equity securities
are recorded on a trade date basis.

AIG evaluates its investments for impairment. As a matter of
policy, the determination that a security has incurred an
other-than-temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss
recognition requires the judgment of AIG’s management and a
continual review of its investments.

In general, a security is considered a candidate for
other-than-temporary impairment if it meets any of the following
criteria:

•

Trading at a significant (25 percent or more) discount to par or
    amortized cost (if lower) for an extended period of time (nine
    months or longer);

•

The occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the
    debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection
    or voluntary reorganization; or

•

The probability of non-realization of a full recovery on its
    investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the
    foregoing events.

At each balance sheet date, AIG evaluates its securities
holdings in an unrealized loss position. Where AIG does not
intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered
their carrying value, based on the circumstances present at the
date of evaluation, AIG records the unrealized loss in income.
If events or circumstances change, such as unexpected changes in
the creditworthiness of the obligor, unanticipated changes in
interest rates, tax laws, statutory capital positions and
liquidity events, among others, AIG revisits its intent.
Further, if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a
balance sheet date pursuant to these unexpected changes in
circumstances, the loss is recognized in the period in which the
intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer existed.

In periods subsequent to the recognition of an
other-than-temporary impairment loss for debt securities, AIG
generally amortizes the discount or reduced premium over the
remaining life of the security in a prospective manner based on
the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows.

(f) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate — net,
Policy, Collateral and Guaranteed Loans —
net:

Mortgage loans on real
estate, policy, collateral and guaranteed loans are carried at
unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is
accrued as earned.

Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans
is based upon certain risk factors and when collection of all
amounts due under the contractual term is not probable. This
impairment is generally measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest income
on such impaired loans is recognized as cash is received.

There is no allowance for policy loans, as these loans serve to
reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and
the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash
surrender value of the policy.

(g) Financial Services — Flight
Equipment:

Flight equipment
is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Major
additions, modifications and interest are capitalized. Normal
maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and
compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease
are provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions
of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the
lessee is reimbursed for certain costs incurred up to but not
exceeding contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG
provides a charge to income for such reimbursements based upon
the expected reimbursements during the life of the lease.
Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line
basis to a residual value of approximately 15 percent over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets but not
exceeding 25 years. Aircraft in the fleet are evaluated, as
necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance
with FAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (FAS 144). FAS 144
requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying
amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. These evaluations for
impairment are significantly affected by estimates of future
revenues and other factors which involve some amount of
uncertainty.

Accounting Policies

This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be
purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of,
the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and
amortization are removed from the related accounts and the
difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in
Other income.

(h) Financial Services — Securities Available
for Sale, at fair value:

These securities are held to meet long-term investment
objectives and are accounted for as available for sale, carried
at current fair values and recorded on a trade-date basis. This
portfolio is hedged using interest rate, foreign exchange,
commodity and equity derivatives. The market risk associated
with such hedges is managed on a portfolio basis, with third
party hedging transactions executed as necessary. As hedge
accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with
FAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), the unrealized gains
and losses on these securities resulting from changes in
interest rates, currency rates and equity prices are recorded in
Other comprehensive income in consolidated shareholders’
equity while the unrealized gains and losses on the related
economic hedges are reflected in Other income.

(i) Financial Services — Trading Securities,
at fair value:

Trading
securities are held to meet short-term investment objectives,
including hedging securities. These securities are recorded on a
trade-date basis and carried at current fair values. Unrealized
gains and losses are reflected in Other income currently.

(j) Financial Services — Spot
Commodities:

Spot commodities
held in AIGFP’s wholly owned broker-dealer subsidiary are
recorded at fair value. All other commodities are recorded at
the lower of cost or market value. Spot commodities are recorded
on a trade-date basis. The exposure to market risk may be
reduced through the use of forwards, futures and option
contracts. Lower of cost or fair value reductions in commodity
positions and unrealized gains and losses in related derivatives
are reflected in Other income currently.

(k) Financial Services — Unrealized Gain and
Unrealized Loss on Swaps, Options and Forward
Transactions:

Interest rate,
currency, equity and commodity swaps, swaptions, options and
forward transactions are accounted for as derivatives recorded
on a trade-date basis and are carried at current market values
or estimated fair values when market prices are not available.
Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income currently,
where appropriate. In certain instances, when income is not
recognized at inception of the contract under EITF 02-03,
income is recognized over the life of the contract and as
observable market data becomes available. Estimated fair values
are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among
other things, current interest, foreign exchange, equity,
commodity and volatility rates. AIG attempts to secure reliable
and independent current market prices, such as published
exchange prices, external subscription services’ prices
such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker quotes for
use in its models. When such prices are not available, AIG uses
an internal methodology which includes interpolation and
extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to
the dates of the transactions. These valuations represent an
assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows
of these transactions and reflect market and credit risk. The
portfolio’s discounted cash flows are evaluated with
reference to current market conditions, maturities within the
portfolio, and other relevant factors. Based upon this
evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if
any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio.
AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions,
including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward
contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the
limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded
values of these transactions may be different from the values
that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the
transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such
differences are not significant to its financial condition or
liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized in
income when the transactions were sold or closed out prior to
maturity.

(l) Financial Services — Trading Assets and
Trading Liabilities:

Trading
assets and trading liabilities include option premiums paid and
received and receivables from and payables to counterparties
which relate to unrealized gains and losses on futures,
forwards, and options and balances due from and due to clearing
brokers and exchanges.

(m) Financial Services — Securities Purchased
(Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract
value:

Purchases of
securities under agreements to resell and sales of securities
under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as
collateralized borrowing or lending transactions and are
recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts, plus
accrued interest. AIG’s policy is to take possession of or
obtain a security interest in securities purchased under
agreements to resell.

AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to
transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual
obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and
collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral
to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary.

(n) Financial Services — Finance
Receivables:

Finance
receivables, which are net of unearned finance charges, are held
for both investment purposes and for sale. Finance receivables
held for investment purposes are carried at amortized cost which
includes accrued finance charges on interest bearing finance
receivables, unamortized deferred origination costs, and
unamortized net premiums and discounts on purchased finance
receivables. The allowance for finance receivable losses is
established through the provision for finance receivable losses
charged to expense and is maintained at a level considered
adequate to absorb estimated credit losses in the existing
portfolio. The portfolio is periodically evaluated on a pooled
basis and factors such as economic conditions, portfolio
composition, and loss and delinquency experience are considered
in the evaluation of the allowance.

Continued

Direct costs of originating loans, net of nonrefundable points
and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of
the related loans. The amount deferred is recognized as an
adjustment to finance charge revenues, using the interest method.

Finance receivables originated and intended for sale in the
secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or market
value, as determined by aggregate outstanding commitments from
investors or current investor yield requirements. AGF recognizes
net unrealized losses through a valuation allowance by charges
to income.

(o) Securities Lending Collateral and Securities Lending
Payable, at fair value:

AIG’s insurance and asset management operations lend their
securities and primarily take cash as collateral with respect to
the securities lent. Invested collateral consists primarily of
floating rate bonds. Income earned on invested collateral, net
of interest payable to the collateral provider, is recorded in
net investment income.

The fair value of securities pledged under securities lending
arrangements was $69 billion and $59 billion as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These securities
are included in bonds available for sale in AIG’s
consolidated balance sheet.

(p) Other Invested
Assets:

Other invested assets
consist primarily of investments by AIG’s insurance
operations in hedge funds and limited partnerships.

Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the
aggregate less than a five percent interest are reported at fair
value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of
Other comprehensive income.

With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which
AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest or
less than a five percent interest but where AIG has more
than a minor influence over the operations of the investee,
AIG’s carrying value is its share of the net asset value of
the funds or the partnerships. The changes in such net asset
values, accounted for under the equity method, are recorded in
earnings through net investment income.

AIG obtains the fair values of its investments in limited
partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the
general partner or manager of each of these investments, the
accounts of which generally are audited on an annual basis.

Also included in other invested assets are real estate held for
investment, aircraft asset investments held by non-financial
services subsidiaries and investments in life settlement
contracts. See Notes 8(g) and 8(h) herein for further
information.

(q) Short-term
Investments:

Short-term
investments consist of interest bearing cash equivalents, time
deposits, and investments with original maturities within one
year, such as commercial paper.

(r) Cash:

Cash
represents cash on hand and non-interest bearing demand deposits.

(s) Reinsurance
Assets:

Reinsurance assets
include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance
companies under the terms of AIG’s reinsurance agreements
for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned
premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident
and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid.
Amounts related to paid and unpaid losses, benefits and loss
expenses with respect to these reinsurance agreements are
substantially collateralized.

(t) Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs:

General Insurance:

Acquisition costs represent those
costs, including commissions, premium taxes and other
underwriting expenses, that vary with and are primarily related
to the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and
amortized over the period in which the related premiums written
are earned. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which
the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for
profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the
profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment
income is not anticipated in the recoverability of deferred
policy acquisition costs.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services:

Acquisition costs represent those costs, including commissions,
underwriting and marketing expenses, that vary with, and are
primarily related to, the acquisition of new business. Policy
acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are
generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period
in accordance with FAS 60, “Accounting and Reporting
by Insurance Enterprises” (FAS 60). Policy acquisition
costs and policy issuance costs related to universal life,
participating life, and investment-type products
(investment-oriented products) are deferred and amortized, with
interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross
profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts
in accordance with FAS 97, “Accounting and Reporting
by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and
for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments”
(FAS 97). Estimated gross profits are composed of net
interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, fees,
surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains
and losses. If estimated gross profits change significantly, DAC
is recalculated using the new assumptions. Any resulting
adjustment is included in current earnings as an adjustment to
DAC. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the
insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for
profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the
profitability (both current and projected future) of the
underlying insurance contracts.

The DAC for investment-oriented products is also adjusted with
respect to estimated gross profits as a result of changes in the
net unrealized gains or losses on debt and equity securities
available for sale. That is, as debt and equity securities
available for sale are carried at aggregate fair value, an
adjustment is made to DAC equal to the change in amortization
that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold
at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested
at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is
included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt
and equity

securities available for sale that is credited or charged
directly to other comprehensive income. DAC has been decreased
by $720 million at December 31, 2006 and decreased by
$1.14 billion at December 31, 2005 for this
adjustment. See also Note 4 herein.

Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at the time of
acquisition and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet
with DAC. This value is based on present value of future pre-tax
profits discounted at current yields applicable at time of
purchase. For products accounted under FAS 60, VOBA is
amortized over the life of the business similar to that for DAC
based on the assumptions at purchase. For FAS 97 products,
VOBA is amortized in relation to the estimated gross profits to
date for each period. As of December 31, 2006, there have
been no impairments of VOBA.

(u) Investments in Partially Owned
Companies:

At
December 31, 2006, AIG’s significant investments in
partially owned companies included its 19.4 percent
interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd., its 26
percent interest in Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, Ltd., its
26 percent interest in Tata AIG General Insurance Company, Ltd.
and its 24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine
Insurance Co., Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes
investments in less significant partially owned companies. The
amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated entities where
AIG’s ownership interest is less than 50 percent were
$28 million, $146 million and $22 million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The undistributed earnings of
unconsolidated entities where AIG’s ownership interest is
less than 50 percent were $300 million, $179 million
and $445 million as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

(v) Real Estate and Other Fixed
Assets:

The costs of
buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated
principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and ten years
for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for
betterments are capitalized and depreciated.

AIG periodically assesses the carrying value of its real estate
for purposes of determining any asset impairment.

Also included in Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets are
capitalized software costs, which represent costs directly
related to obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use
software. Such costs are capitalized and amortized using the
straight-line method over a period generally not to exceed five
years.

(w) Separate and Variable
Accounts:

Separate and
variable accounts represent funds for which investment income
and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the
policyholders who predominantly bear the investment risk. Each
account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are
carried at fair value. The assets of each account are legally
segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any
other business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are
generally equal to the account assets.

(x) Goodwill and Intangible
Assets:

Goodwill is the
excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment
has occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step
process whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment
is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of
impairment, if any. Impairment testing is performed using the
fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and
judgment, at the “reporting unit” level. A reporting
unit is the operating segment, or a business that is one level
below the operating segment if discrete financial information is
prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. The
determination of a reporting unit’s fair value is based on
management’s best estimate, which generally considers the
unit’s market-based earning multiples of peer companies and
expected future earnings. If the carrying value of a reporting
unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value, the excess is
recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net
income. No impairment has been recorded by AIG in 2006, 2005 or
2004. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill result from
foreign currency translation adjustments and other purchase
price adjustments.

(y) Other Assets:

Other assets consist of prepaid expenses, including deferred
advertising costs, sales inducement assets and derivatives
assets at fair value, other than derivatives in AIGFP, and other
deferred charges.

Generally, advertising costs are expensed as incurred except for
certain direct response stand-alone cost pools, which are
deferred over the expected future benefit period in accordance
with Statement of Position 93-7, “Reporting on Advertising
Costs.” In instances where AIG can demonstrate that its
customers have responded specifically to direct-response
advertising, whose primary purpose is to elicit sales to
customers and where it can be shown that such advertising
results in probable future economic benefits, the advertising
costs are capitalized. Deferred advertising costs are amortized
on a cost-pool by cost-pool basis over the expected economic
future benefit period and are reviewed regularly for
recoverability. Deferred advertising costs amounted to
$1.05 billion and $915 million at December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. The amount of expense amortized
into earnings was $359 million, $272 million and
$244 million, for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

AIG offers sales inducements, which include enhanced crediting
rates or bonus payments to contract holders (bonus interest) on
certain annuity and investment contract products. Sales
inducements provided to the contractholder are recognized as
part of the liability for policyholders’ contract deposits
on the consolidated balance sheet. Such amounts are deferred and
amortized over the life of the contract using the same
methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. To qualify for
such accounting treatment, the bonus interest must be explicitly
identified in the contract at inception, and AIG must
demonstrate that such amounts are incremental to amounts AIG
credits on similar contracts without bonus interest, and are
higher than the contract’s expected ongoing crediting rates
for periods after the bonus period. The deferred bonus interest
and other deferred

Continued

sales inducement assets amounted to $1.3 billion and
$1.1 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The amortization expense associated with these
assets is reported within Incurred policy losses and benefits
expense on the consolidated statement of income. Such
amortization expense totaled $135 million,
$127 million and $104 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

See Note 19 herein for a discussion of derivatives.

(z) Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses:

Losses and loss
expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for
losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of
estimates for unpaid reported losses and includes provisions for
losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining
such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including
amounts relating to allowances for estimated unrecoverable
reinsurance, are reviewed and updated. If the estimate of
reserves is determined to be inadequate or redundant, the
increase or decrease is reflected in income. AIG discounts its
loss reserves relating to workers compensation business written
by its U.S. domiciled subsidiaries as permitted by the
domiciliary statutory regulatory authorities.

(aa) Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident and
Health Contracts:

The
liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders’
contract deposits are established using assumptions described in
Note 6 herein.

(bb) Other Policyholders’
Funds:

Other
policyholders’ funds are reported at cost and include any
policyholders’ funds on deposit which encompasses premium
deposits and similar items.

(cc) Financial Services — Securities and Spot
Commodities Sold but not yet Purchased, at market
value:

Securities and spot
commodities sold but not yet purchased represent sales of
securities and spot commodities not owned at the time of sale.
The obligations arising from such transactions are recorded on a
trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Also included are
obligations under gold leases, which are accounted for as a debt
host with an embedded gold derivative.

(dd) Short- and Long-Term
Borrowings:

AIG’s
funding is principally obtained from medium term and long-term
borrowings and commercial paper. Commercial paper, when issued
at a discount, is recorded at the proceeds received and accreted
to its par value. Long-term borrowings are carried at the
principal amount borrowed, net of unamortized discounts or
premiums. See Note 9 herein for additional information.

(ee) Liabilities Connected to Trust Preferred
Stock:

Liabilities connected
to trust preferred stock principally relates to outstanding
securities issued by American General Corporation (AGC), a
wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. Cash distributions on such
preferred stock are accounted for as interest expense.

(ff) Other
Liabilities:

Other
liabilities consist of other funds on deposit, derivatives
liabilities at fair value, other than derivatives in AIGFP, and
other payables. See Note 19 herein for a discussion of
Derivatives. AIG has entered into certain insurance and
reinsurance contracts, primarily in its general insurance
segment, that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be
accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. Accordingly, these
transactions are recorded based upon deposit accounting, and the
premiums received, after deduction for certain related expenses,
are recorded as deposits within Other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. Net proceeds of these deposits are
invested and generate net investment income. As amounts are
paid, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit
liability is reduced.

(gg) Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in Subsidiary
Companies:

Preferred
shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies relates
principally to outstanding preferred stock or interest of ILFC,
a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. Cash distributions on such
preferred stock or interest are accounted for as interest
expense.

(hh) Recent Accounting Standards:

Accounting Changes

FSP FAS

115-1,

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments,” replaces the
measurement and recognition guidance set forth in EITF Issue
No.

and
codifies certain existing guidance on impairment and accretion
of income in periods subsequent to an other-than-temporary
impairment, where appropriate. AIG’s adoption of FSP
FAS

115-1

on
January 1, 2006 did not have a material effect on
AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123,
“Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R). FAS 123R
and its related interpretive guidance replaces FAS 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(FAS 123), which superseded Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (APB 25) and amended FAS 95,
“Statement of Cash Flows.” FAS 123, as originally
issued in 1995, established as preferable a fair-value-based
method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with
employees. On January 1, 2003, AIG adopted the recognition
provisions of FAS 123. See also Note 14 herein. AIG
adopted the provisions of the revised FAS 123R and its
related interpretive guidance on January 1, 2006.

For its service-based awards under the 1999 Stock Option Plan,
2002 Stock Incentive Plan and 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
AIG recognizes compensation on a straight-line basis over the
scheduled vesting period. Unrecognized unvested compensation
expense for stock option awards granted under APB 25 (i.e.,
before January 1, 2003) will be recognized from
January 1, 2006 to the vesting date. However, for the SICO
Plans, the AIG Deferred Compensation Profit Participant Plan
(AIG DCPPP) and the AIG Partners Plan, which contain both
performance and service conditions, AIG recognizes compensation
utilizing a graded vesting expense attribution method. The
effect of this approach is to recognize compensation cost over
the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche
of the award.

AIG’s share-based plans generally provide for accelerated
vesting after the participant turns 65 and retires. For awards

granted after January 1, 2006, compensation expense is
recognized ratably from the date of grant through the shorter of
age 65 or the vesting period. This change did not have a
material effect on AIG’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations. Awards granted prior to January 1,
2006 will continue to be recognized over the vesting period with
accelerated expense recognition upon an actual retirement. Starr
International Company, Inc. (SICO) compensation expense for
participants retiring after age 65 had been reflected in prior
years’ results consistent with vested status under the SICO
Plans.

At the June 2005 meeting, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) reached a consensus with respect to Issue
No.

04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights”
(EITF 04-5). EITF 04-5 addresses what rights held by the
limited partner(s) preclude consolidation in circumstances in
which the sole general partner would consolidate the limited
partnership in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles absent the existence of the rights held by the
limited partner(s). Based on that consensus, the EITF 04-5 also
agreed to amend the consensus in Issue
No.

96-16,

“Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When the
Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority
Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights.” The
guidance in this Issue was effective after June 29, 2005
for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and
for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership
agreements are modified. For general partners in all other
limited partnerships, the guidance in this Issue was effective
beginning January 1, 2006. The effect of the adoption of
this EITF Issue was not material to AIG’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

On June 29, 2005, the FASB issued Statement 133
Implementation Issue No. B38, “Embedded Derivatives:
Evaluation of Net Settlement with Respect to the Settlement of a
Debt Instrument through Exercise of an Embedded Put Option or
Call Option.” This implementation guidance relates to the
potential settlement of the debtor’s obligation to the
creditor that would occur upon exercise of the put option or
call option, which meets the net settlement criterion in
FAS 133. The effective date of the implementation guidance
was January 1, 2006. The adoption of this guidance did not
have a material effect on AIG’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

On June 29, 2005, the FASB issued Statement 133
Implementation Issue No. B39, “Application of
Paragraph 13(b) to Call Options That Are Exercisable Only
by the Debtor.” The conditions in FAS 133
paragraph 13(b) do not apply to an embedded call option in
a hybrid instrument containing a debt host contract if the right
to accelerate the settlement of the debt can be exercised only
by the debtor (issuer/borrower). This guidance does not apply to
other embedded derivative features that may be present in the
same hybrid instrument. The effective date of the implementation
guidance was January 1, 2006. The adoption of this guidance
did not have a material effect on AIG’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

On February 16, 2006, the FASB issued FAS 155,
“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments”
(FAS 155), an amendment of FAS 140 and FAS 133.
FAS 155 allows AIG to include changes in fair value in
earnings on an instrument-by-instrument basis for any hybrid
financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that
would otherwise be required to be bifurcated and accounted for
separately under FAS 133. The election to measure the
hybrid instrument at fair value is irrevocable at the
acquisition or issuance date.

AIG elected to early adopt FAS 155 as of January 1,
2006, and apply FAS 155 fair value measurement to certain
structured note liabilities and structured investments in
AIG’s available for sale portfolio that existed at
December 31, 2005. The effect of this adoption resulted in
an $11 million after-tax ($18 million pre-tax)
decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1,
2006, representing the difference between the fair value of
these hybrid financial instruments and the prior carrying value
as of December 31, 2005. The effect of adoption on
after-tax gross gains and losses was $218 million
($336 million pre-tax) and $229 million
($354 million pre-tax), respectively.

In connection with AIG’s early adoption of FAS 155,
structured note liabilities of $8.9 billion, other
structured liabilities in conjunction with equity derivative
transactions of $111 million, and hybrid financial
instruments of $522 million at December 31, 2006 are
now carried at fair value. The effect on earnings for 2006, for
changes in the fair value of hybrid financial instruments, was a
pre-tax loss of $313 million, of which $287 million is
reflected in Other income and is largely offset by gains on
economic hedge positions which are also reflected in operating
income, and $26 million is reflected in Net investment
income.

In January 2007, the FASB issued Statement 133 Implementation
Issue No. B40, “Embedded Derivatives: Application of
Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized Interests in Prepayable Financial
Assets” (Issue B40). Issue B40 provides guidance for
when prepayment risk needs to be considered in determining
whether mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities
contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. Effective
with AIG’s adoption of FAS 155 beginning
January 1, 2006, AIG has been treating derivatives embedded
in securitized interests in prepayable financial assets in
accordance with the guidance in Issue B40. Therefore, the
adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on
AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

On March 27, 2006, the FASB issued FSP
FTB

85-4-1,

“Accounting for Life Settlement Contracts by Third-Party
Investors”
(FSP

85-4-1),

an
amendment of
FTB

85-4,

“Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.” Life
settlements are designed to assist life insurance policyholders
in monetizing the existing value of life insurance policies.
FSP

85-4-1

allows
AIG to measure life settlement contracts using either the
investment method or fair value method. The election is made on
an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. AIG
elected to early adopt
FSP

85-4-1

as of
January 1, 2006 using the investment method for
pre-existing investments held at December 31, 2005. The
effect of this adoption resulted in a $319 million
after-tax ($487 million pre-tax)

increase to opening retained earnings. See Note 8(h) herein
for additional disclosures related to life settlement contracts.

On April 13, 2006, the FASB issued FSP
FIN

46(R)-6,

“Determining the Variability to be Considered in Applying
FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)”
(FIN

46(R)-6

or
FSP). The FSP affects the identification of which entities are
variable interest entities (VIEs) through a “by
design” approach in identifying and measuring the variable
interests of the VIE and its primary beneficiary. The
requirements became effective beginning in the third quarter of
2006 and are to be applied to all new VIEs with which AIG
becomes involved. The new requirements need not be applied to
entities that have previously been analyzed under FIN 46(R)
unless a reconsideration event occurs. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material effect on AIG’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (FAS 158).
FAS 158 requires AIG to prospectively recognize the over
funded or under funded status of defined benefit postretirement
plans as an asset or liability in AIG’s consolidated
balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in
the year in which the changes occur through Other Comprehensive
Income. FAS 158 also requires AIG to measure the funded
status of plans as of the date of its year-end balance sheet,
with limited exceptions. AIG adopted FAS 158 for the year
ending December 31, 2006. The cumulative effect, net of
deferred income taxes, on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet
at December 31, 2006 was a net reduction in
shareholders’ equity through a charge to Accumulated other
comprehensive income of $532 million, with a corresponding
net decrease of $538 million in total assets, and a net
decrease of $6 million in total liabilities. See
Note 15 herein for additional information on the adoption
of FAS 158.

Future Application of Accounting Standards

On September 19, 2005, the AICPA issued Statement of
Position

05-1,

“Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred
Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges
of Insurance Contracts”
(SOP

05-1).

SOP

05-1

provides
guidance on accounting for DAC on internal replacements of
insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically
described in FAS 97.
SOP

05-1

defines
an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits,
features, rights, or coverage that occurs by the exchange of a
contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or
rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage
within a contract.

The effective date of the implementation guidance is
January 1, 2007. Upon implementation, AIG expects to record
a decrease to opening retained earnings of approximately
$100 million, net of tax, to reflect changes in unamortized
DAC, VOBA, unearned revenue liabilities and deferred sales
inducement assets. This adjustment will reflect changes
including the cumulative effect of a shorter expected
amortization period for deferred items related to certain group
life and health insurance contracts and the effect on the
estimated gross profits of investment-oriented products related
to previously anticipated future internal replacements. AIG does
not expect the implementation of SOP 05-1 to have a material
effect on its consolidated financial condition or its
consolidated results of operations, although operating income
for the Life Insurance & Retirement Services segment
will be negatively affected.

On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109” (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes
a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, and additional disclosures. The effective date of this
implementation guidance is January 1, 2007, with the
cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles
recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. AIG does
not expect the implementation of FIN 48 to be material to
its consolidated financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS 157, “Fair
Value Measurements” (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. AIG is currently
assessing the effect of implementing this guidance.

In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, “The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities” (FAS 159). FAS 159 permits entities
to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments
and certain other items that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value for
designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in
the current period. FAS 159 also establishes presentation
and disclosure requirements for similar types of assets and
liabilities measured at fair value. FAS 159 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. AIG is currently assessing the effect of
implementing this guidance, which depends on the nature and
extent of items elected to be measured at fair value, upon
initial application of the standard on January 1, 2008.

2. Segment Information

AIG identifies its reportable segments by product line
consistent with its management structure. These segments and
their respective operations are as follows:

Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG) writes substantially all
classes of business insurance in the U.S. and Canada, accepting
such business mainly from insurance brokers.

Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic) subsidiaries offer
reinsurance on both a treaty and facultative basis to insurers
in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a
full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on
specialty risks.

AIG’s Personal Lines operations provide automobile
insurance through AIG Direct, a mass marketing operation, Agency
Auto Division and 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century),
as well as a broad range of coverages for high net-worth
individuals through the AIG Private Client Group.

Mortgage Guaranty operations provide guaranty insurance
primarily on conventional first mortgage loans on single family
dwellings and condominiums.

AIG’s Foreign General Insurance group accepts risks
primarily underwritten through American International
Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned
agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General Insurance
group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based
insurance subsidiaries. The Foreign General Insurance group uses
various marketing methods to write both business and consumer
lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs
and needs. AIU operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe,
including the U.K., Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

Each of the General Insurance sub-segments is comprised of
groupings of major products and services as follows: DBG is
comprised of domestic commercial insurance products and
services; Transatlantic is comprised of reinsurance products and
services sold to other general insurance companies; Personal
Lines are comprised of general insurance products and services
sold to individuals; Mortgage Guaranty is comprised of products
insuring against losses arising under certain loan agreements;
and Foreign General is comprised of general insurance products
sold overseas.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services:

AIG’s Life Insurance &
Retirement Services subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance
and retirement savings products both domestically and abroad.
Insurance-oriented products consist of individual and group
life, payout annuities (including structured settlements),
endowment and accident and health policies. Retirement savings
products consist generally of fixed and variable annuities.

AIG’s principal overseas Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations are American Life Insurance
Company (ALICO), American International Assurance Company,
Limited, together with American International Assurance Company
(Bermuda) Limited (AIA), Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd.
(Nan Shan), The Philippine American Life and General Insurance
Company (PhilamLife), AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG
Edison Life) and AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Ltd. (AIG Star
Life). In 2006, the major internal reporting units for the
Foreign Life operations were realigned to better reflect the
current management structure. PhilamLife and other Life
operations were classified as a reporting unit in 2005. In 2006,
PhilamLife is included with AIA, AIRCO and Nan Shan in the Asia
internal reporting unit and other operations are included with
ALICO, AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life in the Japan and Other
reporting unit. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation.

AIG’s principal Domestic Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations are American General Life
Insurance Company (AG Life), The United States Life
Insurance Company in the City of New York (USLIFE), American
General Life and Accident Insurance Company (AGLA and,
collectively with AG Life and USLIFE, the Domestic Life
Insurance internal reporting unit), AIG Annuity Insurance
Company (AIG Annuity), The Variable Annuity Life Insurance
Company (VALIC) and AIG Retirement Services, Inc (AIG SunAmerica
and, collectively with AIG Annuity and VALIC, the Domestic
Retirement Services internal reporting unit).

American International Reinsurance Company (AIRCO) acts
primarily as an internal reinsurance company for AIG’s
insurance operations.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services is comprised of
two major groupings of products and services: insurance-oriented
products and services and retirement savings products and
services.

Financial Services:

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in
diversified financial products and services including aircraft
and equipment leasing, capital markets transactions, consumer
finance and insurance premium finance.

AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations
of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), which
generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used
commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines.
Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for
its own account, and remarketing and fleet management services
for airlines and for financial institutions.

AIG’s Capital Markets operations are conducted through
AIGFP. As Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation,
current and past revenues and operating results may not provide
a basis for predicting future performance.

AIG’s Capital Markets operations derive substantially all
their revenues from hedged financial positions entered in
connection with counterparty transactions rather than from
speculative transactions. These subsidiaries participate in the
derivatives and financial transactions dealer markets
conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency,
equity, commodity, energy and credit products business.

Consumer Finance operations include American General Finance
Inc. (AGF) as well as AIG Consumer Finance Group Inc. (AIGCFG).
AGF and AIGCFG provide a wide variety of consumer finance
products, including non-conforming real estate mortgages,
consumer loans, retail sales finance and credit-related
insurance to customers both domestically and overseas,
particularly in emerging markets.

Asset Management:

AIG’s
Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of
investment-related services and investment products including
institutional and retail asset management, broker-dealer
services and institutional spread-based investment business.
Such services and products are offered to individuals and
institutions both domestically and overseas.

assets.

3. Federal Income Taxes

AIG and its eligible U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return. Life Insurance subsidiaries of
American General Corporation (AGC) also file a consolidated U.S.
federal income tax return and will not be included in AIG’s
consolidated federal income tax return until 2007. Other U.S.
entities included in the consolidated financial statements also
file separate U.S. federal income tax returns. Subsidiaries
operating outside the U.S. are taxed, and income tax
expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and foreign
statutes.

U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on
$1.3 billion of undistributed earnings of certain
U.S. subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated
AIG U.S. federal income tax return because tax planning
strategies are available, and would be utilized, to eliminate
the tax liability related to these earnings. U.S. federal
income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed
earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent
that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite
period of time. At December 31, 2006, the cumulative amount
of undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries approximated
$17.6 billion. Determining the deferred tax liability that
would arise if these earnings were not permanently reinvested
abroad is not practicable.

A component of life insurance surplus accumulated prior to 1984
is not taxable unless it exceeds certain statutory limitations
or is distributed to shareholders. The American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 amended the federal income tax law to permit life
insurance companies to distribute amounts from their
policyholders’ surplus accounts in 2005 and 2006 without
incurring federal income tax on the distributions. In 2005 and
2006, AIG made distributions and eliminated the aggregate
balance of $945 million from its policyholders’
surplus accounts.

A Revenue Agent’s Report proposing to assess additional
taxes for the years 1997 to 1999 has been issued to AIG and a
Letter of Protest contesting the proposed assessments has been
filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A draft
settlement agreed to in substance has been received from the IRS
for years 1997 to 1999. Settlement has been reached with the IRS
for years prior to 1997 although AIG has reserved the right to
timely claim refunds for items related to the restatements of
AIG’s 2004 and prior financial statements during 2005.

In addition, for the years ended September 30, 1993 and
1994, a Notice of Deficiency assessing additional taxes has been
issued to AIG Retirement Services Inc., which has filed a
petition for redetermination with the United States Tax Court
challenging the Notice. Revenue Agents’ Reports for the
years ended September 30, 1995 and 1996 and for the period
from September 30, 1997 to December 31, 1998 have also
been issued to AIG Retirement Services Inc., and Letters of
Protest contesting the proposed assessments have been filed with
the IRS. Similarly, SunAmerica Life Insurance Company
(SunAmerica Life) has also received a proposed assessment and
has filed a protest for the year ended December 31, 1999.

It is management’s belief that there are substantial
arguments in support of the positions taken by AIG, AIG
Retirement Services Inc., and SunAmerica Life in their Letters
of Protest and Tax Court litigation. Although the final outcome
of any issues raised in connection with these years is
uncertain, AIG believes that any tax obligation, including
interest thereon, would not be material to AIG’s
consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

AGC’s tax years through 1999 have been audited and settled
with the IRS. Although a Revenue Agent’s Report has not yet
been issued to AGC for years ended December 31, 2000, 2001
and 2002, AIG has received a notice of proposed adjustment for
certain items during that period from the IRS.

The pretax components of U.S. and
foreign income reflect the locations in which such pretax income
was generated. The pretax U.S. and foreign income was as follows

4. Deferred Policy Acquisition
Costs

The following reflects the policy
acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future
income and the related amortization charged to income for
General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations:

Included in the above table is the VOBA, an intangible asset
recorded during purchase accounting, which is amortized in a
manner similar to DAC. Amortization of VOBA was
$239 million, $291 million and $407 million while
the unamortized balance was $1.98 billion,
$2.14 billion and $2.52 billion for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. The percentage of the unamortized balance of
VOBA at 2006 expected to be amortized for 2007 through 2012 by
year is: 11.3 percent, 10.0 percent, 8.8 percent,
7.3 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively, with
56.6 percent being amortized after five years. These
projections are based on current estimates for investment,
persistency, mortality, and morbidity assumptions. The DAC
amortization charged to income includes the increase or decrease
of amortization for FAS 97-related realized capital gains
(losses), primarily in the Domestic Retirement Services
business. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, the rate of
amortization expense decreased by $98 million,
$46 million and $41 million.

There were no impairments of DAC or VOBA for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

5. Reinsurance

In the ordinary course of business, AIG’s General Insurance
and Life Insurance companies place reinsurance with other
insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification
of AIG’s business and limit the potential for losses
arising from large risks. In addition, AIG’s General
Insurance subsidiaries assume reinsurance from other insurance
companies.

General Reinsurance:

General reinsurance is effected
under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual
risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of
excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over
stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid
reinsurance premiums and are recognized as a reduction of
premiums earned over the contract period in proportion to the
protection received. Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers
are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities
associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of
reinsurance assets. Assumed reinsurance premiums are earned
primarily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the reinsurance
contracts.

General Insurance premiums written and
earned were comprised of the following:

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses
incurred, amounted to $8.3 billion, $20.7 billion and
$12.1 billion, respectively.

Life Insurance:

Life reinsurance is effected principally
under yearly renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect
to these treaties are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums
and are recognized as a reduction of premiums earned over the
contract period in proportion to the protection provided.
Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a
manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying
policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance
assets.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services premiums were comprised of the following:

represented 0.1 percent, 0.3 percent and 2.5 percent
of gross GAAP premiums for the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Supplemental information for gross loss
and benefit reserves net of ceded reinsurance at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 follows:

AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for
AIG’s insurance operations. This facilitates insurance risk
management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital
planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows AIG to
pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more
efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty
risk and relationships and manage global life catastrophe risks.

AIG’s Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance
relationships to

Continued

manage insurance risks and to facilitate capital management
strategies. Pools of highly-rated third-party reinsurers are
utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess of retention
limits. AIG’s Domestic Life Insurance companies also cede
excess, non-economic reserves carried on a statutory-basis only
on certain term and universal life insurance policies and
certain fixed annuities to an offshore affiliate.

AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain
statutory recognition of its intercompany reinsurance
transactions. For this purpose, AIG has a $2.5 billion
syndicated letter of credit facility outstanding as of
December 31, 2006, all of which relates to life
intercompany reinsurance transactions.

AIG is also a party to a 364-day bilateral revolving credit
facility for an aggregate amount of $3.2 billion. The
facility can be drawn in the form of letters of credit with
terms of up to eight years. As of December 31, 2006,
approximately $2.69 billion principal amount of letters of
credit are outstanding under this facility, of which
approximately $1.3 billion relates to life intercompany
reinsurance transactions. AIG has also obtained approximately
$201 million of letters of credit on a bilateral basis.

Reinsurance Security:

AIG’s third party reinsurance
arrangements do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to
its insureds. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to
both general and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any
reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any
reinsurance agreement. AIG holds substantial collateral as
security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of
funds, securities, and/or letters of credit. A provision has
been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has
been largely successful in prior recovery efforts.

AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and
establishes limits per reinsurer through AIG’s Credit Risk
Committee. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer
represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is
AIG’s business substantially dependent upon any single
reinsurer.

6. Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses and Future Life Policy Benefits and Policyholders’
Contract Deposits

Continued

Long duration contract liabilities included in future policy
benefits, as presented in the preceding table, result from life
products. Short duration contract liabilities are primarily
accident and health products. The liability for future life
policy benefits has been established based upon the following
assumptions:

•

Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding
    annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and
    products, range from 1.0 percent to 12.5 percent
    within the first 20 years. Interest rates on
    immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of
    11.5 percent and grade to not greater than 6.0 percent.

•

Mortality and surrender rates are based upon actual experience
    by geographical area modified to allow for variations in policy
    form. The weighted average lapse rate, including surrenders, for
    individual and group life approximated 7.4 percent.

•

The portions of current and prior net income and of current
    unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the
    benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance
    contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the
    countries in which the policies are in force.

•

Participating life business represented approximately
    19 percent of the gross insurance in force at
    December 31, 2006 and 34 percent of gross GAAP
    premiums in 2006. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is
    determined locally by the boards of directors. Provisions for
    future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction,
    reflecting local regulations.

The liability for policyholders’ contract deposits has been
established based on the following assumptions:

•

Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by
    territory and year of issuance, range from 1.2 percent to,
    including bonuses, 12.0 percent. Less than 1.0 percent
    of the liabilities are credited at a rate greater than
    9.0 percent. Current declared interest rates are generally
    guaranteed to remain in effect for a period of one year though
    some are guaranteed for longer periods. Withdrawal charges
    generally range from zero percent to 20.0 percent grading
    to zero over a period of zero to 19 years.

•

Domestically, guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) have market
    value withdrawal provisions for any funds withdrawn other than
    benefit responsive payments. Interest rates credited generally
    range from 2.6 percent to 9.0 percent. The vast
    majority of these GICs mature within five years. Overseas,
    interest rates credited on GICs generally range from
    1.2 percent to 5.2 percent and maturities range from
    one to five years.

•

Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are
    guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate
    credited in 2006 was 5.2 percent.

•

The universal life funds have credited interest rates of
    1.5 percent to 7.0 percent and guarantees ranging from
    1.5 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of
    issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to
    surrender charges that amount to 12.2 percent of the
    aggregate fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer
    than 20 years.

•

For variable products and investment contracts, policy values
    are expressed in terms of investment units. Each unit is linked
    to an asset portfolio. The value of a unit increases or
    decreases based on the value of the linked asset portfolio. The
    current liability at any time is the sum of the current unit
    value of all investment units plus any liability for guaranteed
    minimum death or withdrawal benefits. A portion of these
    liabilities are classified in the Spread-Based Investment
    Business for segment reporting purposes.

Certain products are subject to experience adjustments. These
include group life and group medical products, credit life
contracts, accident and health insurance contracts/riders
attached to life policies and, to a limited extent, reinsurance
agreements with other direct insurers. Ultimate premiums from
these contracts are estimated and recognized as revenue, and the
unearned portions of the premiums recorded as liabilities.
Experience adjustments vary according to the type of contract
and the territory in which the policy is in force and are
subject to local regulatory guidance.

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries file financial statements
prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance
regulatory authorities. The differences between statutory
financial statements and financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign
by jurisdiction. The principal differences are that statutory
financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios
may be carried at amortized cost, assets and liabilities are
presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are
valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets
are non-admitted.

Statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum
company action level requirements following the adjustments, but
AIG nonetheless contributed an additional $750 million of
capital into American Home Assurance Company (American Home)
effective September 30, 2005 and contributed a further
$2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of
approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General
Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005.

Information

Continued

As of December 31, 2006, AIG held 20,172 and 1,750 of
individual bond and stock investments, respectively, that were
in an unrealized loss position, of which 10,846 individual
investments were in an unrealized loss position continuously for
12 months or more.

AIG recorded other-than-temporary impairment losses of
approximately $944 million, $598 million and
$684 million in realized capital gains (losses) in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 1(e) herein for
AIG’s other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy.

(g) Other Invested
Assets:

Other invested assets
as of December 31, 2006 were $42.1 billion, consisting
primarily of hedge funds and limited partnerships. Approximately
$5.3 billion relates to available for sale investments
carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded
in a separate component of Other comprehensive income, net of
deferred taxes, with almost all of the remaining investments
being accounted for on the equity method of accounting. All of
the investments are subject to impairment testing (see
Note 1(e) herein). The gross unrealized loss on the
investments accounted for as available for sale as of
December 31, 2006 was $167 million, the majority of
which represents investments that have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.

Other invested assets at December 31, 2006, also includes
approximately $1.8 billion of aircraft asset investments
held by non-financial services subsidiaries.

(h) Investments in Life Settlement
Contracts:

In June 2006, AIG
restructured its ownership of life settlement contracts with no
effect on the economic substance of these investments. At the
same time, AIG paid $610 million to its former co-investors
to acquire all the remaining interests in life settlement
contracts held in previously non-consolidated trusts. The life
insurers for a small portion of these newly consolidated life
settlement contracts include AIG subsidiaries. As a result,
amounts related to life insurance issued by AIG subsidiaries are
eliminated in consolidation.

At December 31, 2006, the carrying value of AIG’s life
settlement contracts was $1.1 billion, and is included in
Other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheet. These
investments are monitored for impairment on a contract by
contract basis quarterly. During 2006, income recognized on life
settlement contracts previously held in non-consolidated trusts
was $38 million, and is included in net investment income
on the consolidated statement of income. Further information
regarding life settlement contracts as of December 31, 2006
is as follows:

As of December 31, 2006, the anticipated life insurance
premiums required to keep the life settlement contracts in
force, payable in the ensuing twelve months ending
December 31, 2007 and the four succeeding years ending
December 31, 2011 are $77 million, $81 million,
$85 million, $86 million, and $87 million,
respectively.

Financial Services

(i) Economic Hedging of Securities Available for
Sale:

AIGFP follows a policy
of minimizing interest rate, currency, commodity, and equity
risks associated with securities available for sale by entering
into internal offsetting positions, on a security by security
basis within its derivatives portfolio, thereby offsetting a
significant portion of the unrealized appreciation and
depreciation. In addition, to reduce its credit risk, AIGFP has
entered into credit derivative transactions with respect to
$128 million of securities available for sale to
economically hedge its credit risk. As previously discussed,
these economic offsets did not meet the hedge accounting
requirements of FAS 133 and, therefore, are recorded in
Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(b) AIG Borrowings:

(i) Notes and bonds issued by
AIG:

In October 2006, AIG established a medium term note
program under its shelf registration statement providing for the
issuance of up to $25.1 billion of AIG debt securities. The
proceeds from the issuance of these debt securities may be used
(i) by AIG (ii) by AIGFP as it would use the proceeds
from its own borrowings as discussed below or (iii) to fund
the Matched Investment Program (MIP). As of December 31,
2006, $1.8 billion principal amount of notes were
outstanding under the medium term note program, of which
(i) $749 million was used for AIG’s general
corporate purposes, (ii) $72 million was used by AIGFP
and (iii) $1.0 billion was used to fund the MIP. The
maturity dates of these notes range from 2011 to 2046. To the
extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions
to manage its effective borrowing rate with respect to these
notes.

As of December 31, 2006, the equivalent of
$5.7 billion of notes were outstanding under AIG’s
Euro medium term note program, of which the proceeds from
$3.7 billion of notes were used to fund the MIP and the
remainder was used for AIG’s general corporate purposes.
AIG has hedged the currency exposure arising from foreign
currency denominated notes by economically hedging that
exposure, although such hedges did not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment under FAS 133.

In 2006, AIG issued in Rule 144A/Regulation S
offerings $3 billion principal amount of senior notes, of
which $1.0 billion was exchanged by AIG for substantially
identical notes that are registered under the Securities Act of
1933 (Securities Act). The proceeds from the sale of
$2.25 billion of these notes were used for AIG’s
general corporate purposes and $750 million were used to
fund the MIP.

In November 2006, AIG filed a shelf registration statement in
Japan, providing for the issuance of up to Japanese Yen
300 billion principal amount of senior notes in the
aggregate. In December 2006, AIG issued the equivalent of
$429 million under this shelf registration statement, the
proceeds of which were used for AIG’s general corporate
purposes.

(ii) Notes and bonds issued by
SunAmerica Inc. (SAI):

As of December 31, 2006,
notes and bonds originally issued by SAI aggregating
$435 million (net of unamortized discount of
$40 million) were outstanding with maturity dates from 2007
to 2097 at interest rates ranging from 5.60 percent to
9.95 percent.

(iii) Redemption of Zero Coupon
Convertible Senior Debentures:

On November 9, 2006,
AIG redeemed all of its outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible
Senior Debentures initially issued in 2001 for an aggregate
redemption price of $1.07 billion.

(c) AIGFP Borrowings:

(i) Borrowings under Obligations of
Guaranteed Investment Agreements:

Borrowings under
obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), which
are guaranteed by AIG, are recorded at the amount outstanding
under each contract. Obligations may be called at various times
prior to maturity at the option of the counterparty. Interest
rates on these borrowings are primarily fixed, vary by maturity,
and range up to 9.8 percent.

Funds received from GIA borrowings are invested in a diversified
portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. At
December 31, 2006, the fair value of securities pledged as
collateral with respect to these obligations approximated
$7.4 billion.

(ii) Notes and Bonds issued by AIGFP:

At December 31, 2006, AIGFP’s
notes and bonds outstanding, the proceeds of which are invested
in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative
transactions, were as follows:

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

Continued

9. Debt Outstanding

Continued

AIGFP economically hedges its notes and bonds. AIG guarantees
all of AIGFP’s debt.

(iii) Hybrid financial instrument
liabilities:

AIGFP’s notes and bonds include
structured debt instruments whose payment terms are linked to
one or more financial or other indices (such as an equity index
or commodity index or another measure that is not considered to
be clearly and closely related to the debt instrument). These
notes contain embedded derivatives that otherwise would be
required to be accounted for separately under FAS 133. Upon
AIG’s early adoption of FAS 155, AIGFP elected the fair
value option for these notes. The notes that are accounted for
using the fair value option are reported separately under hybrid
financial instrument liabilities at fair value.

(d) AGC Borrowings:

As of December 31, 2006, AGC notes aggregating
$797 million were outstanding with maturity dates ranging
from 2010 to 2029 at interest rates of up to 7.50 percent.
AIG guarantees the notes and bonds of AGC.

(e) Liabilities Connected to Trust Preferred
Stock:

AGC issued Junior
Subordinated Debentures (liabilities) to certain trusts
established by AGC, which represent the sole assets of the
trusts. The trusts have no independent operations. The trusts
issued mandatory redeemable preferred stock to investors. The
interest terms and payment dates of the liabilities correspond
to those of the preferred stock. AGC’s obligations with
respect to the liabilities and related agreements, when taken
together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by AGC
of payments due on the preferred securities. AIG guarantees the
obligations of AGC with respect to these liabilities and related
agreements. The liabilities are redeemable, under certain
conditions, at the option of AGC on a proportionate basis.

As of December 31, 2006, the preferred stock outstanding
consisted of $300 million liquidation value of 8.5 percent
preferred stock issued by American General Capital II in June
2000, $500 million liquidation value of 8.125 percent
preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital
B in March 1997, and $500 million liquidation value of
7.57 percent preferred stock issued by American General
Institutional Capital A in December 1996.

(f) ILFC Borrowings:

(i) Notes and Bonds issued by
ILFC:

As of December 31, 2006, notes aggregating
$22.8 billion were outstanding, consisting of
$12.8 billion of term notes, $9.0 billion of
medium-term notes with maturities ranging from 2007 to 2013 and
interest rates ranging from 3.32 percent to
6.62 percent and $1.0 billion of junior subordinated
debt as discussed below. Notes aggregating $5.1 billion are
at floating interest rates and the remainder are at fixed rates.
To the extent deemed appropriate, ILFC may enter into swap
transactions to manage its effective borrowing rates with
respect to these notes.

As a well-known seasoned issuer, ILFC has filed an automatic
shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) allowing ILFC immediate access to the U.S.
public debt markets. During 2006, $1.9 billion of debt
securities were issued under this registration statement and
$3.52 billion were issued under a prior registration
statement. In addition, ILFC has a Euro medium term note program
for $7.0 billion, under which $4.28 billion in notes
were sold through December 31, 2006. The foreign exchange
adjustment for the foreign currency denominated debt was
$733 million at December 31, 2006 and
$197 million at December 31, 2005. ILFC has
substantially eliminated the currency exposure arising from
foreign currency denominated notes by economically hedging the
portion of the note exposure not already offset by
Euro-denominated operating lease payments, although such hedges
did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
FAS 133.

In December 2005, ILFC issued two tranches of junior
subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion to underlie trust
preferred securities issued by a trust sponsored by ILFC. Both
tranches mature on December 21, 2065, but each tranche has
a different call option. The $600 million tranche has a
call date of December 21, 2010 and the $400 million
tranche has a call date of December 21, 2015. The note with
the 2010 call date has a fixed interest rate of 5.90 percent for
the first five years. The note with the 2015 call date has a
fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent for the first ten years.
Both tranches have interest rate adjustments if the call option
is not exercised. The new interest rate is a floating quarterly
reset rate based on the initial credit spread plus the highest
of (i) 3 month LIBOR, (ii) 10-year constant
maturity treasury and (iii) 30-year constant maturity
treasury.

(ii) Export credit facility:

ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility (ECA) for
use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft
delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various
European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from
5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing
ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the
aircraft. At December 31, 2006, ILFC had $1.0 billion
outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a
pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title
to the aircraft financed under the facility.

In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured ECA for up
to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be
delivered through May 31, 2005. The facility was
subsequently increased to $3.64 billion and extended to
include aircraft to be delivered through May 31, 2007. The
facility becomes available as the various European Export Credit
Agencies provide their guarantees for aircraft based on a
six-month forward-looking calendar, and the interest rate is
determined through a bid process. At December 31, 2006,
ILFC had $1.7 billion outstanding under this facility.

(iii) Bank Financings:

From
time to time, ILFC enters into various bank financings. As of
December 31, 2006, the total funded amount was
$1.2 billion. The financings mature through 2012.

AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.

(g) AGF Borrowings:

As of December 31, 2006, notes and bonds aggregating
$19.59 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging
from 2007 to 2031 at interest rates ranging from

1.94 percent to 8.45 percent. To the extent deemed
appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its
effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.

As a well-known seasoned issuer, AGF has filed an automatic
shelf registration statement with the SEC allowing AGF immediate
access to the U.S. public debt markets. At
December 31, 2006, AGF had the corporate authority to issue
up to $13.4 billion of debt securities registered under the
Securities Act using AGF’s effective shelf registration
statements.

AGF uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds for
the funding of its finance receivables. AIG does not guarantee
any of the debt obligations of AGF.

(i) Revolving Credit Facilities of AIG, ILFC and

AIG, ILFC and AGF
maintain the following committed, unsecured revolving credit
facilities in order to support their respective commercial paper
programs and for general corporate purposes. AIG, ILFC and AGF

(j) Interest Expense for All
Indebtedness:

Total interest
expense for all indebtedness, net of capitalized interest,
aggregated $6.95 billion in 2006, $5.7 billion in 2005
and $4.4 billion in 2004. Capitalized interest was
$59 million in 2006, $64 million in 2005 and
$59 million in 2004. Cash distributions on the preferred
shareholders’ equity in subsidiary companies of ILFC and
liabilities connected to trust preferred stock of AGC
subsidiaries are accounted for as interest expense in the
consolidated statement of income. The cash distributions for
ILFC were approximately $5 million, $5 million and
$4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The cash distributions for AGC
subsidiaries were approximately $107 million,
$112 million and $123 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

10. Preferred Shareholders’
Equity in Subsidiary Companies

As of December 31, 2006, preferred shareholders’
equity in subsidiary companies represents preferred stocks
issued by ILFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG.

At December 31, 2006, the preferred stock consists of 1,000
shares of market auction preferred stock (MAPS) in two series
(Series A and B) of 500 shares each. Each of the MAPS
shares has a liquidation value of $100,000 per share and is
not convertible. The dividend rate, other than the initial rate,
for each dividend period for each series is reset approximately
every seven weeks (49 days) on the basis of orders placed
in an auction. During 2006, ILFC extended each of the MAPS
dividend periods for three years. At December 31, 2006, the
dividend rate for Series A MAPS was 4.70 percent and
the dividend rate for Series B MAPS was 5.59 percent.

11. Shareholders’ Equity and
Earnings Per Share

Shareholders’ Equity

AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow in the form
of loans, advances, reimbursement for shared expenses, and
dividends. AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be
remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For
example, unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of
Insurance, general insurance companies domiciled in New York may
not pay dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month
period exceed the lesser of ten percent of the
company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus or
100 percent of its “adjusted net investment
income,” as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions
applicable to both General and Life Insurance companies exist in
most of the other states in which AIG’s insurance
subsidiaries are domiciled. Certain foreign jurisdictions have
restrictions which could delay or limit the remittance of
dividends. There are also various local restrictions limiting
cash loans and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a
result of the restrictions, approximately 90 percent of
consolidated shareholders’ equity was restricted from
immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2006, there were 6,000,000 shares of
AIG’s $5 par value serial preferred stock authorized,
issuable in series, none of which were outstanding.

Earnings Per Share

Continued

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding, retroactively adjusted to
reflect all stock dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings
per share are based on those shares used in basic earnings per
share plus shares that would have been outstanding assuming
issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common
shares outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock
dividends and stock splits.

The computation of earnings per share
for December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was as
follows:

(a)

Assumes conversion of contingently convertible bonds due to
    the adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8 “Accounting Issues
    Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and
    the Effect on Diluted Earnings per Share.”

(b)

Certain shares arising from employee stock plans were not
    included in the computation of diluted earnings per share where
    the exercise price of the options exceeded the average market
    price and would have been antidilutive. The number of shares
    excluded were 13 million, 19 million and
    7 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

12. Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are entered into by AIG and certain of
its subsidiaries. In addition, AIG guarantees various
obligations of certain subsidiaries.

(a) Litigation and Investigations

Litigation Arising from Operations.

AIG and its
subsidiaries, in common with the insurance and financial
services industries in general, are subject to litigation,
including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of
their business. In AIG’s insurance operations, litigation
arising from claims settlement activities is generally
considered in the establishment of AIG’s reserve for losses
and loss expenses. However, in certain circumstances, AIG
provides disclosure because of the size or nature of the
potential liability to AIG. The potential for increasing jury
awards and settlements makes it difficult to assess the ultimate
outcome of such litigation.

Litigation Arising from Insurance Operations —
Caremark.

AIG and certain of its subsidiaries have been
named defendants in two putative class actions in state court in
Alabama that arise out of the 1999 settlement of class and
derivative litigation involving Caremark Rx, Inc. (Caremark). An
excess policy issued by a subsidiary of AIG with respect to the
1999 litigation was expressly stated to be without limit of
liability. In the current actions, plaintiffs allege that the
judge approving the 1999 settlement was misled as to the extent
of available insurance coverage and would not have approved the
settlement had he known of the existence and/or unlimited nature
of the excess policy. They further allege that AIG, its
subsidiaries, and Caremark are liable for fraud and suppression
for misrepresenting and/or concealing the nature and extent of
coverage. In their complaint, plaintiffs request compensatory
damages for the 1999 class in the amount of $3.2 billion,
plus punitive damages. AIG and its subsidiaries deny the
allegations of fraud and suppression and have asserted,

inter
alia,

that information concerning the excess policy was
publicly disclosed months prior to the approval of the
settlement. AIG and its subsidiaries further assert that the
current claims are barred by the statute of limitations and that
plaintiffs’ assertions that the statute was tolled cannot
stand against the public disclosure of the excess coverage.
Plaintiffs, in turn, have asserted that the disclosure was
insufficient to inform them of the nature of the coverage and
did not start the running of the statute of limitations. The
trial court is currently considering, under standards mandated
by the Alabama Supreme Court, whether a class action can be
certified. AIG cannot reasonably estimate either the likelihood
of its prevailing in these actions or the potential damages in
the event liability is determined.

Litigation Arising from Insurance Operations —
Gunderson.

A subsidiary of AIG has been named as a defendant
in a putative class action lawsuit in the 14th Judicial
District Court for the State of Louisiana. The

Gunderson

complaint alleges failure to comply with certain provisions of
the Louisiana Any Willing Provider Act (the Act) relating to
discounts taken by defendants on bills submitted by Louisiana
medical providers and hospitals that provided treatment or
services to workers compensation claimants and seeks monetary
penalties and injunctive relief. On July 20, 2006, the
court denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment and
granted plaintiffs’ partial motion for summary judgment,
holding that the AIG subsidiary was a “group
purchaser” and, therefore, potentially subject to liability
under the Act. On November 28, 2006, the court issued an
order certifying a class of providers and hospitals. In an
unrelated action also arising under the Act, a Louisiana
appellate court ruled that the district court lacked
jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims at issue. In response,
defendants in

Gunderson

filed an exception for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction. On January 19, 2007, the court
denied the motion, holding that it has jurisdiction over the
putative class claims. The AIG subsidiary is appealing the class
certification ruling and intends to seek an appeal from the
jurisdictional ruling. While AIG believes that it has
meritorious defenses to plaintiffs’ claims, it cannot
currently estimate the likelihood of prevailing in this action
or reasonably estimate the likely damages, if any.

2006 Regulatory Settlements.

In February 2006, AIG
reached a resolution of claims and matters under investigation
with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), SEC, the
Office of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) and the New
York State Department of Insurance (DOI). AIG recorded an
after-tax charge of $1.15 billion relating to these
settlements in the fourth quarter of 2005.

The settlements resolved investigations conducted by the SEC,
NYAG and DOI in connection with the accounting, financial
reporting and insurance brokerage practices of AIG and its
subsidiaries, as well as claims relating to the underpayment of
certain workers compensation premium taxes and other
assessments. These settlements did not, however, resolve
investigations by regulators from other states into insurance
brokerage practices related to contingent commissions and other
broker-related conduct, such as alleged bid rigging. Nor did the
settlements resolve any obligations that AIG may have to state
guarantee funds in connection with any of these matters.

As a result of these settlements, AIG made payments or placed
amounts in escrow in 2006 totaling approximately
$1.64 billion, $225 million of which represented fines
and penalties. Amounts held in escrow totaling
$699 million, including interest thereon, are included in
other assets at December 31, 2006. At that date,
approximately $314 million of the funds were escrowed for
settlement of claims resulting from the underpayment by AIG of
its residual market assessments for workers compensation. The
National Workers Compensation Reinsurance Pool on behalf of its
participant members and various states have communicated to AIG
that they may assert claims with respect to the underpayment of
such assessments. AIG cannot currently estimate whether the
amount ultimately required to settle these claims will exceed
the funds escrowed for this purpose.

The remaining escrowed funds, which amounted to $385 at
December 31, 2006, are set aside for settlements with
certain AIG policyholders specified in the settlements who
claimed to have been harmed by AIG’s insurance brokerage
practices. Any funds remaining at the end of the escrow period
will be used to resolve claims asserted by policyholders
relating to such insurance brokerage practices, including those
described in Private Litigation below.

In addition to the escrowed funds, the $800 million was
deposited into a fund under the supervision of the SEC as part
of the settlements to be available to resolve claims asserted
against AIG by investors including, the shareholder lawsuits
described herein.

At the current time, AIG cannot predict the outcome of the
matters described above, or estimate any potential additional
cost related to these matters.

Also, as part of the settlements, AIG has agreed to retain, for
a period of three years, an independent consultant who will
conduct a review that will include, among other things, the
adequacy of AIG’s internal control over financial
reporting, the policies, procedures and effectiveness of
AIG’s regulatory, compli-

ance and legal functions and the remediation plan that AIG has
implemented as a result of its own internal review.

Private Litigation

Securities Actions.

Beginning in October 2004, a number
of putative securities fraud class action suits were filed
against AIG and consolidated as

In re American International
Group, Inc. Securities Litigation.

Subsequently, a separate,
though similar, securities fraud action was also brought against
AIG by certain Florida pension funds. The lead plaintiff in the
class action is a group of public retirement systems and pension
funds benefiting Ohio state employees, suing on behalf of
themselves and all purchasers of AIG’s publicly traded
securities between October 28, 1999 and April 1, 2005.
The named defendants are AIG and a number of present and former
AIG officers and directors, as well as Starr, SICO, General
Reinsurance Corporation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC),
among others. The lead plaintiff alleges, among other things,
that AIG: (1) concealed that it engaged in anti-competitive
conduct through alleged payment of contingent commissions to
brokers and participation in illegal bid-rigging;
(2) concealed that it used “income smoothing”
products and other techniques to inflate its earnings;
(3) concealed that it marketed and sold “income
smoothing” insurance products to other companies; and
(4) misled investors about the scope of government
investigations. In addition, the lead plaintiff alleges that
AIG’s former Chief Executive Officer manipulated AIG’s
stock price. The lead plaintiff asserts claims for violations of
Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act,
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and
Rule

10b-5

promulgated thereunder, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
and Section 20A of the Exchange Act. In April 2006, the
court denied the defendants’ motions to dismiss the second
amended class action complaint and the Florida complaint. In
December 2006, a third amended class action complaint was filed,
which does not differ substantially from the prior complaint.
Fact and class discovery is currently ongoing.

ERISA Action.

Between November 30, 2004 and
July 1, 2005, several ERISA actions were filed on behalf of
purported class of participants and beneficiaries of three
pension plans sponsored by AIG or its subsidiaries. A
consolidated complaint filed on September 26, 2005 alleges
a class period between September 30, 2000 and May 31,
2005 and names as defendants AIG, the members of AIG’s
Retirement Board and the Administrative Boards of the plans at
issue, and four present or former members of AIG’s Board of
Directors. The factual allegations in the complaint are
essentially identical to those in the securities actions
described above. Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated
duties under ERISA by allowing the plans to offer AIG stock as a
permitted investment, when defendants allegedly knew it was not
a prudent investment, and by failing to provide participants
with accurate information about AIG stock. AIG’s motion to
dismiss was denied by order dated December 12, 2006.
Discovery will be consolidated with proceedings in the
securities actions.

Derivative Actions — Southern District of New
York.

Between October 25, 2004 and July 14, 2005, seven
separate derivative actions were filed in the Southern District
of New York, five of which were consolidated into a single
action. The New York derivative complaint contains nearly the
same types of allegations made in the securities fraud and ERISA
actions described above. The named defendants include current
and former officers and directors of AIG, as well as
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (Marsh), SICO, Starr,
ACE Limited and subsidiaries (ACE), General Reinsurance
Corporation, PwC, and certain employees or officers of these
entity defendants. Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of
fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets,
unjust enrichment, insider selling, auditor breach of contract,
auditor professional negligence and disgorgement from AIG’s
former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
incentive-based compensation and AIG share proceeds under
Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among others.
Plaintiffs seek, among other things, compensatory damages,
corporate governance reforms, and a voiding of the election of
certain AIG directors. AIG’s Board of Directors has
appointed a special committee of independent directors (special
committee) to review the matters asserted in the operative
consolidated derivative complaint. The court has approved
agreements staying the derivative case pending in the Southern
District of New York while the special committee performs its
work. The current stay extends until March 14, 2007.

Derivative Actions — Delaware Chancery Court.

From October 2004 to April 2005, AIG shareholders filed five
derivative complaints in the Delaware Chancery Court. All of
these derivative lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action. The amended consolidated complaint names 43 defendants
(not including nominal defendant AIG) who, like the New York
consolidated derivative litigation, are current and former
officers and directors of AIG, as well as other entities and
certain of their current and former employees and directors. The
factual allegations, legal claims and relief sought in Delaware
action are similar to those alleged in the New York derivative
actions, except that plaintiffs in the Delaware derivative
action assert claims only under state law. The court has
approved agreements staying the derivative case pending in the
Delaware Chancery Court while the special committee performs its
work. The current stay extends until March 14, 2007.

An additional derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware
Chancery Court in December 2002 against twenty directors and
executives of AIG as well as against AIG as a nominal defendant,
alleges, among other things, that the directors of AIG breached
the fiduciary duties of loyalty and care by approving the
payment of commissions to Starr and of rental and service fees
to SICO and the executives breached their duty of loyalty by
causing AIG to enter into contracts with Starr and SICO and
their fiduciary duties by usurping AIG’s corporate
opportunity. The complaint further alleges that the Starr
agencies did not provide any services that AIG was not capable
of providing itself, and that the diversion of commissions to
these entities was solely for the benefit of Starr’s
owners. The complaint also alleged that the service fees and
rental payments made to SICO and its subsidiaries were improper.

Under the terms of a stipulation approved by the Court on
February 16, 2006, the claims against the outside
independent directors were dismissed with prejudice, while the
claims against the other directors were dismissed without
prejudice. On October 31, 2005, Messrs. Greenberg,
Matthews and Smith, SICO and Starr filed motions to dismiss the
amended complaint. In an opinion dated June 21, 2006, the
Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss, except with
respect to plaintiff’s challenge to payments made to Starr
before January 1, 2000. On July 21, 2006, plaintiff
filed its second amended complaint, which alleges that, between
January 1, 2000 and May 31, 2005, individual
defendants breached their duty of loyalty by causing AIG to
enter into contracts with Starr and SICO and breached their
fiduciary duties by usurping AIG’s corporate opportunity.
Starr is charged with aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary
duty and unjust enrichment for its acceptance of the fees. SICO
is no longer named as a defendant. Discovery is currently
ongoing.

Policyholder Actions.

After the NYAG filed its complaint
against insurance broker Marsh, policyholders brought multiple
federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act (RICO) class actions in jurisdictions across
the nation against insurers and brokers, including AIG and a
number of its subsidiaries, alleging that the insurers and
brokers engaged in a broad conspiracy to allocate customers,
steer business, and rig bids. These actions, including 18
complaints filed in different federal courts naming AIG or an
AIG subsidiary as a defendant, were consolidated by the judicial
panel on multi-district litigation and transferred to the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey for
coordinated pretrial proceedings. The consolidated actions have
proceeded in that court in two parallel actions,

In re
Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation

(the

Commercial
Complaint

) and

In re Employee Benefit Insurance Brokerage
Antitrust Litigation

(the

Employee Benefits
Complaint

, and together with the

Commercial Complaint,

the multi-district litigation).

The plaintiffs in the

Commercial Complaint

are nineteen
corporations, individuals and public entities that contracted
with the broker defendants for the provision of insurance
brokerage services for a variety of insurance needs. The broker
defendants are alleged to have placed insurance coverage on the
plaintiffs’ behalf with a number of insurance companies
named as defendants, including AIG subsidiaries. The

Commercial Complaint

also named ten brokers and fourteen
other insurers (one of which has since settled) as defendants.
The

Commercial Complaint

alleges that defendants engaged
in a widespread conspiracy to allocate customers through
“bid-rigging” and “steering” practices. The

Commercial Complaint

also alleges that the insurer
defendants permitted brokers to place business with AIG
subsidiaries through wholesale intermediaries affiliated with or
owned by those same brokers rather than placing the business
with AIG subsidiaries directly. Finally, the

Commercial
Complaint

alleges that the insurer defendants entered into
agreements with broker defendants that tied insurance placements
to reinsurance placements in order to provide additional
compensation to each broker. Plaintiffs assert that the
defendants violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, RICO, the
antitrust laws of 48 states and the District of Columbia,
and are liable under common law breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment theories. Plaintiffs seek treble damages plus
interest and attorneys’ fees as a result of the alleged
RICO and Sherman Act violations.

The plaintiffs in the

Employee Benefits Complaint

are
nine individual employees and corporate and municipal employers
alleging claims on behalf of two separate nationwide purported
classes: an employee class and an employer class that acquired
insurance products from the defendants from August 26, 1994
to the date of any class certification. The

Employee Benefits
Complaint

names AIG, as well as eleven brokers and five
other insurers, as defendants. The activities alleged in the

Employee Benefits Complaint,

with certain exceptions,
track the allegations of contingent commissions, bid-rigging and
tying made in the

Commercial Complaint.

On October 3, 2006, Judge Hochberg of the District of New
Jersey reserved in part and denied in part motions filed by the
insurer defendants and broker defendants to dismiss the
multi-district litigation. The Court also ordered the plaintiffs
in both actions to file supplemental statements of particularity
to elaborate on the allegations in their complaints. Plaintiffs
filed their supplemental statements on October 25, 2006,
and the AIG defendants, along with other insurer and broker
defendants in the two consolidated actions, filed renewed
motions to dismiss on November 30, 2006. Briefing has been
completed on the renewed motions to dismiss, as well as
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in both cases.
On February 16, 2007, Chief Judge Brown of the District of
New Jersey transferred the multi-district litigation to himself.
Oral argument on the renewed motions to dismiss has been
scheduled before Chief Judge Brown on March 1, 2007. Fact
discovery in the multi-district litigation proceeding is ongoing.

A number of complaints making allegations similar to those in
the

Commercial Complaint

have been filed against AIG and
other defendants in state and federal courts around the country.
The defendants have thus far been successful in having the
federal actions transferred to the District of New Jersey and
consolidated into the multi-district litigation. The AIG
defendants have also sought to have state court actions making
similar allegations stayed pending resolution of the
multi-district litigation proceeding. In one state court action
pending in Florida, the trial court recently decided not to
grant an additional stay, but instead to allow the case to
proceed.

Litigation Relating to 21st Century.

Shortly after
the announcement in late January 2007 of AIG’s offer to
acquire the outstanding shares of 21st Century not already
owned by AIG and its subsidiaries, two related class actions
were filed in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles
County, against AIG, 21st Century, and the individual
members of 21st Century’s Board of Directors, two of
whom are current executive officers of AIG. The actions were
filed purportedly on behalf of the minority shareholders of
21st Century and assert breaches of fiduciary duty in
connection with the AIG proposal. The complaints allege that the
proposed per share price is unfair and seek preliminary

and permanent injunctive relief to enjoin the consummation of
the proposed transaction.

SICO.

In July, 2005, SICO filed a complaint against AIG
in the Southern District of New York, claiming that AIG had
refused to provide SICO access to certain artwork and asked the
court to order AIG immediately to release the property to SICO.
AIG filed an answer denying SICO’s allegations and setting
forth defenses to SICO’s claims. In addition, AIG filed
counterclaims asserting breach of contract, unjust enrichment,
conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, a constructive trust and
declaratory judgment, relating to SICO’s breach of its
commitment to use its AIG shares only for the benefit of AIG and
AIG employees. Fact and expert discovery has been substantially
concluded and briefing on SICO’s motion for summary
judgment is underway.

Regulatory Investigations.

Regulators from several states
have commenced investigations into insurance brokerage practices
related to contingent commissions and other industry-wide
practices as well as other broker-related conduct, such as
alleged bid-rigging. In addition, various federal and state
regulatory agencies are reviewing certain transactions and
practices of AIG and its subsidiaries in connection with
industry-wide and other inquiries. AIG has cooperated, and will
continue to cooperate, in producing documents and other
information in response to subpoenas and other requests.

Wells Notices.

AIG understands that some of its employees
have received Wells notices in connection with previously
disclosed SEC investigations of certain of AIG’s
transactions or accounting practices. Under SEC procedures, a
Wells notice is an indication that the SEC staff has made a
preliminary decision to recommend enforcement action that
provides recipients with an opportunity to respond to the SEC
staff before a formal recommendation is finalized. It is
possible that additional current and former employees could
receive similar notices in the future as the regulatory
investigations proceed.

Effect on AIG

In the opinion of AIG management, AIG’s ultimate liability
for the unresolved litigation and investigation matters referred
to above is not likely to have a material adverse effect on
AIG’s consolidated financial condition, although it is
possible that the effect would be material to AIG’s
consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting
period.

(b) Commitments

Flight Equipment

At December 31, 2006, ILFC had committed to purchase 254
new aircraft deliverable from 2007 through 2015 at an estimated
aggregate purchase price of $19.0 billion. ILFC will be
required to find customers for any aircraft acquired, and it
must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of
such equipment.

Other Commitments

On June 27, 2005, AIG entered into an agreement pursuant to
which AIG agrees, subject to certain conditions, to make any
payment that is not promptly paid with respect to the benefits
accrued by certain employees of AIG and its subsidiaries under
the SICO Plans (as discussed in Note 16 herein).

(c) Contingencies

Loss Reserves

Although AIG regularly reviews the adequacy of the established
reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can be no assurance
that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not develop
adversely and materially exceed AIG’s current loss
reserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and
loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines
of business, which include excess and umbrella liability,
directors and officers liability (D&O), professional
liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general
liability, products liability and related classes, as well as
for asbestos and environmental exposures. Generally, actual
historical loss development factors are used to project

future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that
future loss development patterns will be the same as in the
past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss
development factors might not be discernible for an extended
period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss
reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the
potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be
significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss
development factors that were relied upon in setting the
reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development
factors could be attributable to changes in inflation, in labor
and material costs or in the judicial environment, or in other
social or economic phenomena affecting claims.

Superior National.

On December 30, 2004, an
arbitration panel issued its ruling in connection with a 1998
workers compensation quota share reinsurance agreement under
which Superior National Insurance Company, among others, was
reinsured by USLIFE, a subsidiary of AGC. In its 2-1 ruling, the
arbitration panel refused to rescind the contract as requested
by USLIFE. Instead, the panel reformed the contract to reduce
USLIFE’s participation by ten percent. Further, the
arbitration ruling established a second phase of arbitration for
USLIFE to present its challenges to certain cessions to the
contract. The second phase has now been completed, and the
arbitration panel has issued two awards resolving the issues
presented in phase two in favor of the cedents. USLIFE has filed
a petition to vacate all of the arbitration awards from both
phases of the arbitration in California federal court. In
addition, USLIFE is pursuing certain insurance recoverables in
connection with the contract. As a result of the ruling AIG
increased its reserves by $125 million in the fourth
quarter to $478 million. AIG believes that the reserves should
be adequate to fund unpaid claims.

Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits.

AIG generates income tax
credits as a result of investing in synthetic fuel production.
Tax credits generated from the production and sale of synthetic
fuel under the Internal Revenue Code are subject to an annual
phase-out provision that is based on the average wellhead price
of domestic crude oil. The price range within which the tax
credits are phased-out was originally established in 1980 and is
adjusted annually for inflation. Depending on the price of
domestic crude oil for a particular year, all or a portion of
the tax credits generated in that year might be eliminated. AIG
evaluates the production levels of its synthetic fuel production
facilities in light of the risk of phase-out of the associated
tax credits. As a result of fluctuating domestic crude oil
prices, AIG evaluates and adjusts production levels when
appropriate in light of this risk. Regardless of oil prices, the
tax credits expire after 2007.

(d) Guarantees

AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to derivative
financial instruments with market risk resulting from both
dealer and end-user activities and to reduce currency, interest
rate, equity and commodity exposures. These instruments are
carried at their estimated fair values in the consolidated
balance sheet. The vast majority of AIG’s derivative
activity is transacted by AIGFP. See also Note 19 herein.

AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the
prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment
obligations and liabilities of AIGFP arising from transactions
entered into by AIGFP.

SAI Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of AIG, has established a deferred compensation plan
for registered representatives of certain AIG subsidiaries,
pursuant to which participants have the opportunity to invest
deferred commissions and fees on a notional basis. The value of
the deferred compensation fluctuates with the value of the
deferred investment alternatives chosen. AIG has provided a full
and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of SAI Deferred
Compensation Holdings, Inc. to pay the deferred compensation
under the plan.

13. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments” (FAS 107), requires disclosure of fair
value information about financial instruments, as defined
therein, for which it is practicable to estimate such fair
value. In the measurement of the fair value of certain financial
instruments, where quoted market prices are not available, other
valuation techniques are utilized. These fair value estimates
are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies
based on available and observable market information.
FAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including
those related to insurance contracts and lease contracts.

The following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in
estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:

Cash and short-term investments:

The carrying amounts
approximate fair values.

Fixed maturity securities:

Fair values were generally
based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity
securities for which market prices were not readily available,
fair values were estimated using values obtained from
independent pricing services.

Equity securities:

Fair values were based on quoted
market prices. Where market prices were not readily available,
fair values were estimated using quoted market prices of
comparable investments.

Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral
loans:

Where practical, the fair values of loans on real
estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash
flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental
lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the
policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have
to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Trading assets and trading liabilities:

Fair values
approximate the carrying values.

13. Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

Continued

Finance receivables:

Fair values were estimated using
discounted cash flow calculations based upon the weighted
average rates currently being offered for similar finance
receivables.

Securities lending collateral and securities lending
payable:

The contract values of these financial instruments
approximate fair value.

Spot commodities:

Fair values are based on current market
prices.

Unrealized gains and losses on swaps, options and forward
transactions:

Fair values were based on the use of valuation
models that utilize, among other things, current interest,
foreign exchange commodity, equity and volatility rates, as
applicable.

Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell
(repurchase), at contract value:

As these securities
(obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values
approximate fair values.

Other invested assets:

Consisting principally of hedge
funds and limited partnerships. Fair values are determined based
on the net asset values provided by the general partner or
manager of each investment.

Policyholders’ contract deposits:

Fair values were
estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon
interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts
with maturities consistent with those remaining for the
contracts being valued.

GIAs:

Fair values of AIG’s obligations under
investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash
flow calculations based on interest rates currently being
offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with
those remaining for the agreements being valued.

Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet
purchased:

The carrying amounts for the securities and spot
commodities sold but not yet purchased approximate fair values.
Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on
current market prices.

Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other
depositors:

To the extent certain amounts are not demand
deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than
one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it
would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Commercial paper:

The carrying amount approximates fair
value.

Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages:

Where practical, the
fair values of these obligations were estimated using discounted
cash flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities
consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.

14. Stock Compensation
Plans

At December 31, 2006, AIG employees could be awarded
compensation pursuant to six different stock-based compensation
plan arrangements:

(i)

AIG 1999 Stock Option Plan,
as amended (1999 Plan);

(ii)

AIG 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended (1996 Plan);

(iii)

AIG
2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (2002 Plan) under which
AIG has issued time-vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and
performance restricted stock units (performance RSUs);

(iv)

SICO’s Deferred Compensation Profit
Participation Plans (SICO Plans);

(v)

AIG’s
2005-2006 Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan (AIG
DCPPP) and

(vi)

the AIG Partners Plan. The AIG DCPPP
was adopted as a replacement for the SICO Plans for the
2005-2006 period, and the AIG Partners Plan replaces the AIG
DCPPP. Stock-based compensation earned under the AIG DCPPP
and the AIG Partners Plan is issued as awards under the
2002 Plan. AIG currently settles share option exercises and
other share awards to participants through the issuance of
shares it has previously acquired and holds in its treasury
account, except for share awards made by SICO, which are settled
by SICO.

At December 31, 2006, AIG’s non-employee directors
received stock-based compensation in two forms, options granted
pursuant to the 1999 Plan and grants of AIG common stock with
delivery deferred until retirement from the Board, pursuant to
the AIG Director Stock Plan, which was approved by the
shareholders at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

From January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005, AIG
accounted for share-based payment transactions with employees
under FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” Share-based employee compensation expense
from option awards was not recognized in the statement of income
in prior periods. Effective January 1, 2006, AIG adopted
the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R.
FAS 123R requires that companies use a fair value method to
value share-based payments and recognize the related
compensation expense in net earnings. AIG adopted FAS 123R
using the modified prospective application method, and
accordingly, financial statement amounts for the prior periods
presented have not been restated to reflect the fair value
method of expensing share-based compensation under
FAS 123R. The modified prospective application method
provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to
share-based compensation

Plans

for shares subscribed for or granted on or after January 1,
2006 and all previously granted but unvested awards as of
January 1, 2006.

The adoption of FAS 123R resulted in share-based
compensation expense of approximately $17 million during
2006, related to awards which were accounted for under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”
FAS 123R also requires AIG to estimate forfeitures in
calculating the expense relating to share-based compensation,
rather than recognizing these forfeitures and corresponding
reductions in expense as they occur. The pre-tax cumulative
effect of adoption, recognized as a reduction in stock-based
compensation of $46 million, was recorded as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change, net of tax. FAS 123R
requires AIG to reflect the cash savings resulting from excess
tax benefits in its financial statements as cash flow from
financing activities, rather than as cash flow from operating
activities as in prior periods. The amount of this excess tax
benefit for 2006 was $27.9 million.

Included in AIG’s consolidated statement of income for the
year ended December 31, 2006 was pre-tax share-based
compensation expense of $353 million ($326 million
after tax).

The effect of the adoption of
FAS 123R on the consolidated statements of income and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2006 was as
follows:

Included in share-based compensation expense of
$353 million for 2006 was a one-time compensation cost of
approximately $54 million related to the Starr tender offer
and various out of period adjustments totalling
$61 million, primarily relating to stock-splits and other
miscellaneous items for the SICO Plans, offset by a
$46 million pre-tax adjustment for the cumulative effect of
the adoption of FAS 123R. See Note 16 herein for a
discussion of the Starr tender offer.

If AIG had adopted the FAS 123 provisions for recognizing
compensation expense commencing at the date of grant of the
awards, the effect would not have been material to net income or
basic or diluted earnings per share for 2005.

1999 Stock Option Plan

The 1999 Plan provides that options to purchase a maximum of
45,000,000 shares of common stock can be granted to certain
key employees and members of the Board of Directors at prices
not less than fair market value at the date of grant.

The 1999 Plan was approved by the shareholders at the 2000
Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with certain amendments approved
at the 2003 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The 1999 Plan
superseded the 1991 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan),
although outstanding options granted under the 1991 Plan
continue

in-force

until
exercise or expiration. The maximum number of shares that may be
granted to any employee in any one year under the 1999 Plan
is 900,000. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally
vest over four years (25 percent vesting per year) and
expire 10 years from the date of grant.

At December 31, 2006, there were 19,615,911 shares
reserved for future grants under the 1999 Plan and
28,021,943 shares reserved for issuance under the 1999 and
1991 Plans.

Deferrals

At December 31, 2006, AIG was obligated to issue
8,382,632 shares in connection with previous exercises of
options with delivery deferred.

Valuation Methodology

In 2004, AIG developed a binomial lattice model to calculate the
fair value of stock option grants. In prior years, a
Black-Scholes model was used. A more detailed description of the
valuation methodology is provided below.

The following weighted average
assumptions were used for stock options granted in 2006 and
2005:



Expected annual dividend

0.92%

The following table presents
information about stock options outstanding at December 31,
2006:

Vested and expected-to-vest options as of December 31,
2006, included in the table above, totaled 45,382,149, with a
weighted average exercise price of $57.42, a weighted average
contractual life of 4.33 years and an aggregate intrinsic
value of $720 million.

As of December 31, 2006, total unrecognized compensation
cost (net of expected forfeitures) was $133 million and
$3 million related to non-vested share-based compensation
awards granted under the 1999 Plan and the 1996 Plan,
respectively, with blended weighted average periods of
1.44 years and 0.41 years, respectively. The cost of
awards outstanding under these plans at December 31, 2006
is expected to be recognized over approximately three years and
one year, respectively, for the 1999 Plan and the 1996 Plan.

The intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006 was
approximately $215 million. The fair value of options
vesting during 2006 was approximately $97 million. AIG
received $104 million and $65 million in cash during
2006 and 2005, respectively, from the exercise of stock options.
The tax benefits realized as a result of stock option exercises
were $35 million and $20 million for 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

2002 Stock Incentive Plan

The 2002 Plan was adopted at the 2002 Annual Meeting of
shareholders and amended and restated by the AIG Board of
Directors on September 18, 2002. The 2002 Plan provides
that equity-based or equity-related awards with respect to
shares of common stock can be issued to employees in any year up
to a maximum of that number of shares equal to
(a) 1,000,000 shares plus (b) the number of
shares available but not issued in the prior calendar year. The
maximum award that a grantee may receive under the 2002 Plan per
year is rights with respect to 250,000 shares. During 2006
and 2005, 6,836,785 RSUs, including performance RSUs, and
3,055,835 RSUs, respectively, were granted by AIG. There
were 4,488,458 shares reserved for issuance in connection
with future awards at December 31, 2006. Substantially all
RSUs granted to date under the 2002 Plan other than performance
RSUs granted under the AIG DCPPP and the AIG Partners Plan vest
on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.

Director Stock Awards

The methodology used for valuing employee stock options is also
used to value director stock options. Director stock options
vest one year after the grant date, but are otherwise the same
as employee stock options. Options with respect to
40,000 shares and 32,500 shares were granted during
2006 and 2005, respectively.

AIG also granted 14,000 shares and 6,250 shares, with
delivery deferred, to directors during 2006 and 2005,
respectively, under the Director Stock Plan. At
December 31, 2006, there were 71,000 shares reserved
for future grants under the Director Stock Plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

AIG’s 1996 Plan provides that eligible employees (those
employed at least one year) may receive privileges to purchase
up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of AIG common
stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair market
value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege.
Purchase privileges are granted quarterly and are limited to the
number of whole shares that can be purchased on an annual basis
by an amount equal to the lesser of 10 percent of an
employee’s annual salary or $10,000.

SICO Plans

The SICO Plans provide that shares of AIG common stock currently
held by SICO are set aside for the benefit of the participant
and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors
currently may permit an early payout of shares under certain
circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is not entitled
to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such
shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain

conditions, including but not limited to the participant’s
termination of employment with AIG prior to normal retirement
age.

Historically, SICO’s Board of Directors could elect to pay
a participant cash in lieu of shares of AIG common stock.
On December 9, 2005, SICO notified participants that
essentially all subsequent distributions would be made only in
shares, and not cash. As of that date, AIG modified its
accounting for the SICO Plans from variable to fixed measurement
accounting. Variable measurement accounting is used for those
few awards for which cash elections had been made prior to March
2005. The SICO Plans are also described in Note 16 herein.

Although none of the costs of the various benefits provided
under the SICO Plans have been paid by AIG, AIG has recorded
compensation expense for the deferred compensation amounts paid
to AIG employees by SICO, with an offsetting amount credited to
additional

paid-in

capital reflecting amounts deemed contributed by SICO.

As of December 9, 2005, there were 12,650,292 non-vested
AIG shares under the SICO Plans with a weighted-average fair
value per share of $61.92. As of December 31, 2006, there
were 11,443,772 non-vested AIG shares under the SICO Plans with
a weighted-average fair value per share of $61.72.

A significant portion of the awards under the SICO Plans vest
upon retirement when or after the participant reaches
age 65. The portion of the awards for which early payout is
available vest on the applicable payout date.

AIG DCPPP

Effective September 21, 2005, AIG adopted the
AIG DCPPP, which provides equity-based compensation to key
AIG employees, including senior executive officers. The
AIG DCPPP was modeled on the SICO Plans.

The AIG DCPPP contingently allocates a fixed number of shares to
each participant if AIG’s cumulative adjusted earnings per
share, as determined by AIG’s Compensation Committee, for
2005 and 2006 exceed that for 2003 and 2004. The performance
period is September 21, 2005 to December 31, 2006. At
the end of the performance period, common shares are
contingently allocated. The service period and related vesting
consists of three pre-retirement tranches and a final retirement
tranche at age 65.

At December 31, 2006, there were units representing
4,590,622 shares granted to participants.

AIG Partners Plan

On June 26, 2006, AIG’s Compensation Committee
approved two grants under the AIG Partners Plan. The first grant
has a performance period which runs from January 1, 2006
through December 31, 2007. The second grant has a
performance period which runs from January 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2008. Both grants vest 50 percent on the
fourth and sixth anniversaries of the first day of the related
performance period. In addition, the Compensation Committee
approved the performance metrics for the two grants prior to the
date of grant. The measurement of the grants is deemed to have
occurred on June 26, 2006 when there was mutual
understanding of the key terms and conditions of the grants.
Consistent with this treatment:
a) 1,068,605 performance RSUs for the first grant and
2,488,865 performance RSUs for the second grant and
b) unrecognized compensation of $49 million for the
first grant and $137 million for the second grant are
included in the related disclosure tables. Performance RSUs
related to the first grant are excluded from AIG’s diluted
shares calculation because an insufficient amount of time has
elapsed to conclusively determine that the performance metric
will be achieved at the end of the related performance period.
Because the performance period for the second grant does not
begin until January 1, 2007, compensation expense for the
second grant is not included in AIG’s 2006 results and
diluted shares calculation.

Valuation

The fair value of each award granted under the 2002 Plan,
the AIG DCPPP, the AIG Partners Plan, and the SICO Plans is
based on the closing price of AIG stock on the date of grant.

The following table presents a summary
of shares relating to outstanding awards unvested under the

15. Employee Benefits

(a) Pension Plans:

Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries and certain affiliated
companies, including employees in foreign countries, are
generally covered under various funded, unfunded and insured
pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the various
plans is based on either completion of a specified period of
continuous service or date of hire, subject to age limitations.
Some AIG subsidiaries provide retirement benefits through
defined benefit plans, others employ defined contribution plans
and some use both.

AIG’s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory
defined benefit plan which is subject to the provisions of
ERISA. All employees of AIG and most of its subsidiaries and
affiliates who are regularly employed in the United States,
including certain U.S. citizens employed abroad on a U.S. dollar
payroll, and who have attained age 21 and completed twelve
months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this
plan. An employee with 5 or more years of plan participation is
entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at
age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final
compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to
44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is
subject to certain limitations. Employees may elect certain
options with respect to receipt of their pension benefits
including a joint and survivor annuity. An employee with 10 or
more years of plan participation may retire early from age 55 to
64. An early retirement factor is applied resulting in a reduced
benefit. If an employee terminates with less than five years of
continuous service, the employee forfeits the right to receive
any pension benefits accumulated to that time. Annual funding
requirements are determined based on the “projected unit
credit” cost method, which attributes a pro rata portion of
the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each
year of credited service.

The HSB Group Inc. (HSB) retirement plan was merged into the AIG
U.S. retirement plan effective April 1, 2001. Benefits for
HSB participants were changed effective January 1, 2005 to
be substantially similar to the AIG U.S. retirement plan
benefits subject to a grandfathering agreement.

21st Century sponsors its own benefit plans for its eligible
employees. Assets, obligations and costs with respect to 21st
Century’s plans are included herein. The assumptions used
in its plans were not significantly different from those used by
AIG in AIG’s U.S. plans.

The AIG Excess Retirement Income Plan provides a benefit equal
to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG U.S.
retirement plan as a result of federal tax limitations on
compensation and benefits payable thereunder. AIG has adopted a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental Plan) to
provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives.
Under the Supplemental Plan, an annual benefit accrues at a
percentage of final average pay multiplied by each year of
credited service, not greater than 60 percent of final average
pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and any
predecessor retirement plans (including the AIG Excess
Retirement Income Plan and any comparable plans), Social
Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior
employers. Currently, each of these plans is unfunded. AGC and
HSB have adopted similar supplemental type plans. These plans
are also unfunded.

Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined benefit plans, they
are generally either based on the employees’ years of
credited service and compensation in the years preceding
retirement, or on points accumulated based on the
employee’s job grade and other factors during each year of
service.

AIG is in the process of spinning off the assets and liabilities
in the AIG U.S. retirement plan attributable to employees
of Starr and The Starr Foundation. The accumulated benefit
obligation of the employees in these two entities was computed
as of December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, the AIG
U.S. retirement plan was funded at an amount slightly
greater than the accumulated benefit obligation. In the first
quarter of 2007, AIG will transfer assets of approximately
$32 million, which is the equivalent of the present value
of the December 31, 2005 accumulated benefit (adjusted for
interest and benefit payments through the transfer date)
attributable to the employees in those entities. Consistent with
this arrangement, the amounts shown in the financial statements
and footnote exclude liabilities and assets for employees of
Starr.

(b) Postretirement
Plans:

In addition to
AIG’s defined benefit pension plans, AIG and its
subsidiaries provide a postretirement benefit program for
medical care and life insurance in the U.S. and in certain
non-U.S. countries. Eligibility in the various plans is
generally based upon completion of a specified period of
eligible service and attaining a specified age. Overseas,
benefits vary by geographic location.

AIG’s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate
retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service.

age 65 by May 1, 1989 and their dependents participate
in the medical plan at no cost. Employees who retired after
May 1, 1989 and prior to January 1, 1993 pay 50
percent of the active employee premium. Retiree contributions
are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features
of the medical plan include deductibles, coinsurance and
Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum benefit of
$2.0 million. The maximum life insurance benefit prior to
age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000 thereafter.

Effective January 1, 1993, both plans’ provisions were
amended. Employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are
required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits premium
reduced by a credit of a certain amount, based on years of
service at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age
at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through
59; $10,000 for retirement at ages 60 through 64; and
$15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over.

(c) Voluntary Savings
Plans:

AIG sponsors a
voluntary savings plan for domestic employees (the AIG Incentive
Savings plan), which provides for salary reduction contributions
by employees and matching contributions by AIG of up to
seven percent of annual salary depending on the
employees’ years of service. Contributions are funded
currently.

(d) Postemployment
Benefits:

AIG provides
certain benefits to inactive employees who are not retirees.
Certain of these benefits are insured and expensed currently;
other expenses are provided for currently. Such uninsured
expenses include long-term disability benefits, medical and life
insurance continuation, and COBRA medical subsidies.

(e) Benefit
Obligations:

The measurement
date for some of the

non-U.S.

defined
benefit pension and postretirement plans is November 30,
consistent with the fiscal year end of the sponsoring companies.
For all other plans, accumulated benefit obligations represent
the present value of pension benefits earned as of
December 31, 2006 based on service and compensation as of
December 31, 2006. Projected benefit obligations for
defined benefit plans represent the present value of pension
benefits earned as of December 31, 2006 projected for
estimated salary increases to an assumed date with respect to
retirement, termination, disability or death. Projected benefit
obligations for postretirement plans represent the present value
of postretirement medical and life insurance benefits deemed
earned as of December 31, 2006 projected for estimated
salary and medical claim rate increases to an assumed date with
respect to retirement, termination, disability, or death.

The accumulated benefit obligations
with respect to both non-U.S. and U.S. pension benefit plans as
of December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

(c)

With respect to AIG’s

non-U.S.

plan
    obligations, $100 million of this increase is the result of
    the reclassification of the Swiss plans. The Swiss plans were
    previously categorized as defined contribution plans since
    insurance companies have guaranteed the risks associated with
    these plans. However, the cost of paying for these guarantees is
    now viewed as a liability for the company in Switzerland.
    Therefore, the Swiss plans are treated as defined benefit plans.
    $45 million of the increase is due to the inclusion of new
    plans during 2006.

to determine the benefit obligations at December 31, 2006

The benefit obligations for non-U.S. plans reflect those
assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic
environments of each of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.

To measure the obligations at December 31, 2006 for
AIG’s U.S. plans, an 8.0 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits for
pre-age-65 retirees, a 6.7 percent annual rate of increase
in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits for
post-age-65 retirees and a 10.0 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of retiree prescription drug
coverage were used for 2007. These rates were assumed to
decrease gradually to 5.0 percent in 2013 and remain at
that level thereafter.

To measure the obligations at December 31, 2005 for
AIG’s U.S. plans, a 9.0 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefit for
pre-age-65 retirees, a 7.0 percent annual rate of increase
in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits for
post-age-65 retirees and an 11.0 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of retiree prescription drug
coverage was used for 2006.

The assumed range for 2007 with respect to the annual rates of
increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits
of AIG’s non-U.S. plans is 6.0 to 8.0 percent. These
rates are assumed to decrease gradually to 4.0 to
6.0 percent over the next three years and remain at that
level thereafter.

A one percent point change in the
assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the following
effect on AIG’s postretirement benefit obligations at
December 31, 2006* and 2005:

Discount Rate Methodology

The projected benefit cash flows under the AIG Retirement Plan
were discounted using the spot rates derived from the Citigroup
Pension Discount Curve as of December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005 and an equivalent single discount rate
was derived resulting in the same liability. This single
discount rate was rounded to the nearest 25 basis points,
namely 6.0 percent and 5.5 percent as of
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
The rates applied to other U.S. plans were not significantly
different from those discussed above.

Japan represents over 62 percent of the liabilities of the

non-U.S.

pension plans.
The discount rate for Japan was selected by reference to the
published Moody’s/S&P AA Corporate Bond Universe
at the measurement date having regard to the duration of the
plans’ liabilities.

The mortality assumption used to determine the obligations for
the U.S. plans as of December 31, 2006 and
December 31, 2005 was based on the RP2000 White Collar
Combined Mortality Table projected to 2006. The mortality
assumptions for AIG’s

non-U.S.

plans
vary by country. There was a change in the mortality table
assumption for Ireland, Japan, Taiwan and United Kingdom as of
December 31, 2006 (November 30, 2006 for non-U.S. plans of
sponsoring companies with a fiscal year-end date of
November 30, 2006). The assumptions used are expected to
reasonably anticipate future mortality experience. No other
significant changes have been made for the December 31,
2006 obligations (November 30, 2006 obligations for non-U.S.
plans of sponsoring companies with a fiscal year-end date of
November 30, 2006).

(f) Funded Status:

The funded status of the AIG defined benefit plans is a
comparison of the projected benefit obligations to the assets
related to the respective plan, if any. Effective
December 31, 2006, AIG has adopted FAS  158
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans” — an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). All amounts
shown are pre-tax, unless noted otherwise.

602,680 shares of AIG common stock, with values of $4.0
million and $41.1 million, respectively.

The investment strategy with respect to AIG’s pension plan
assets is designed to achieve investment returns that will fully
fund the pension plan over the long term, while limiting the
risk of under funding over shorter time periods.

The expected rate of return with respect to AIG’s domestic
pension plan was 8.0 percent for years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005. These rates of return are an
aggregation of

expected returns within each asset category. The return with
respect to each asset class considers both historical returns
and the future expectations for such returns.

(h) Expected Cash
Flows:

With respect to
AIG’s U.S. pension plan, the actuarially prepared
funding amount ranges from the minimum amount AIG would be
required to contribute to the maximum amount that would be
deductible for U.S. tax purposes. This range is generally
not determined until the fourth quarter with respect to the
contribution year. Contributed amounts in excess of the minimum
amounts are deemed voluntary. Amounts in excess of the maximum
amount would be subject to an excise tax and may not be
deductible under the Internal Revenue Code. Supplemental and
excess plans’ payments and postretirement plan payments are
deductible when paid.

AIG contributed $80 million during 2006 to its U.S. and

non-U.S.

pension
plans. The annual pension contribution for 2007 is expected to
be approximately $95 million for U.S. and

non-U.S.

For the U.S. plans, the estimated net loss, prior service
credit and transition obligation for the defined benefit pension
plans that will be amortized from Accumulated other
comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the
next fiscal year are $37 million, $3 million and

the estimated net loss, prior service credit and transition
obligation for the defined benefit pension plans that will be
amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive income into net
periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are
$11 million, $10 million and $1 million,
respectively. The estimated net loss, prior service credit and
transition obligation for the other defined benefit
postretirement plans that will be amortized from Accumulated
other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over

The weighted average assumptions used
to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

*

The benefit obligations for non-U.S. plans reflect those
    assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic
    environments of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.

AIG’s postretirement plans provide benefits primarily in
the form of defined employer contributions rather than defined
employer benefits. Changes in the assumed healthcare cost trend
rate do not have a material effect on postretirement expense.

16. Benefits Provided by Starr
International Company, Inc. and C.V. Starr & Co.,
Inc.

SICO has provided a series of two-year Deferred Compensation
Profit Participation Plans (SICO Plans) to certain AIG
employees. The SICO Plans came into being in 1975 when the
voting shareholders and Board of Directors of SICO, a private
holding company whose principal asset is AIG common stock,
decided that a portion of the capital value of SICO should be
used to provide an incentive plan for the current and succeeding
managements of all American International companies, including
AIG.

None of the costs of the various benefits provided under the
SICO Plans has been paid by AIG, although AIG has recorded a
charge to reported earnings for the deferred compensation
amounts paid to AIG employees by SICO, with an offsetting amount
credited to additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed
contributed by SICO. The SICO Plans provide that shares
currently owned by SICO are set aside by SICO for the benefit of
the participant and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board
of Directors currently may permit an early payout of units under
certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is not
entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with respect
to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture under
certain conditions, including but not limited to the
participant’s voluntary termination of employment with AIG
prior to normal retirement age. Under the SICO Plans,
SICO’s Board of Directors may elect to pay a participant
cash in lieu of shares of AIG common stock. Following
notification from SICO to participants in the SICO Plans that it
will settle specific future awards under the SICO Plans with
shares rather than cash, AIG modified its accounting for the
SICO Plans from variable to fixed measurement accounting.
AIG gave effect to this change in settlement method beginning on
December 9, 2005, the date of SICO’s notice to
participants in the SICO Plans. See also Note 12(b)
Commitments herein.

Compensation expense in 2006 included various out of period
adjustments totaling $61 million, primarily relating to
stock-splits and other miscellaneous items for the SICO plans.
See also Note 14 herein.

In January 2006, C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. (Starr)
completed its tender offer to purchase Starr interests from AIG
employees. In conjunction with AIG’s adoption of
FAS 123R, Starr is considered to be an “economic
interest holder” in AIG. As a result, compensation expense
of $54 million was recorded in 2006 results with respect to
the Starr tender offer.

As a result of its changing relationship with Starr and SICO,
AIG has established new executive compensation plans to replace
the SICO plans and investment opportunities previously provided
by Starr. See Note 14 for a description of these plans.

Compensation expense with respect to the SICO Plans aggregated
$108 million, $205 million and $62 million for
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

17. Ownership and Transactions
With Related Parties

(a) Ownership:

According to the Schedule 13D filed on November 20,
2006 by Starr, SICO, Edward E. Matthews, Maurice R. Greenberg,
the Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Family Foundation, Inc.,
the Universal Foundation, Inc. and the Maurice R. and Corinne P.
Greenberg Joint Tenancy Company, LLC, these reporting persons
could be deemed to beneficially own 365,923,844 shares of
common stock at that date. Based on the shares of common stock
outstanding as of January 31, 2007, this ownership would
represent approximately 14 percent of the

voting stock of AIG. Although these reporting persons have made
filings under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, reporting
sales of shares of common stock, no amendment to the
Schedule 13D has been filed to report a change in ownership
subsequent to November 20, 2006.

(b) Transactions with Related
Parties:

Prior to the
termination of their agency relationships with Starr during
2006, AIG and its subsidiaries paid commissions to Starr and its
subsidiaries for the production and management of insurance
business in the ordinary course of business. Payment for the
production of insurance business to Starr aggregated
approximately $47 million in 2006, $214 million in
2005, and $205 million in 2004. AIG also received
approximately $4 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005,
and $24 million in 2004 from Starr and paid none in 2006,
approximately $20,000 in 2005, and $39,000 in 2004 to Starr in
rental fees and none in 2006 and 2005 and $262,000 in 2004 for
services. AIG also received none in 2006, approximately
$2 million in 2005, and $1 million in 2004,
respectively, from SICO and paid none in 2006 and approximately
$1 million in each of the years 2005 and 2004 to SICO as
reimbursement for services rendered at cost. AIG also paid to
SICO $2 million in 2006, $3 million in 2005, and
$4 million in 2004 in rental fees. There are no significant
receivables from/payables to related parties at
December 31, 2006.

18. Variable Interest
Entities

FIN 46R clarifies the consolidation accounting for certain
entities in which equity investors do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity that is at risk which would allow the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support. FIN 46R recognizes that consolidation
based on majority voting interest should not apply to certain
types of entities that are defined as VIEs. A VIE is
consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that
absorbs a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the
expected residual returns of the VIE, or both.

AIG, in the normal course of business, is involved with various
VIEs. In some cases, AIG has participated to varying degrees in
the design of the entity. AIG’s involvement in VIEs varies
from being a passive investor to managing and structuring the
activities of the VIE. AIG engages in transactions with VIEs to
manage its investment needs, obtain funding as well as
facilitate client needs through AIGGIC and AIGFP. AIG purchases
debt securities (rated and unrated) and equity interests issued
by VIEs, makes loans and provides other credit support to VIEs,
enters into insurance and reinsurance transactions with VIEs,
enters into leasing arrangements with VIEs, enters into
derivative transactions with VIEs through AIGFP and acts as the
collateral manager of VIEs through AIGGIC and AIGFP. Obligations
to outside interest holders in VIEs consolidated by AIG are
reported as liabilities in the consolidated financial
statements. These interest holders generally have recourse only
to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have
recourse to AIG, except where AIG has provided a guarantee to
the VIE’s interest holders.

AIG determines whether an entity is a VIE, who the variable
interest holders are, and which party is the primary beneficiary
of the VIE by performing an analysis of the design of the VIE
that includes a review of, among other factors, its capital
structure, contractual relationships and terms, nature of the
entity’s operations and purpose, nature of the
entity’s interests issued, AIG’s interests in the
entity which either create or absorb variability and related
party relationships. AIG consolidates a VIE in situations where
all of AIG’s interests in the VIE, when combined, absorb a
majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected
residual returns of the VIE.

In addition to the VIEs that are consolidated in accordance with
FIN 46R, the Company has significant variable interests in
certain other VIEs that are not consolidated because the Company
is not the primary beneficiary. AIG applies quantitative and
qualitative measures in identifying significant variable
interests.

Entities for which AIG is the primary beneficiary and
consolidates or where AIG has a significant variable interest
are as follows:

SunAmerica Affordable Housing Partnerships

SunAmerica Affordable Housing Partners, Inc.
(SAAHP) organizes limited partnerships (investment
partnerships) that are considered to be VIEs, and that are
consolidated by AIG. The investment partnerships invest as
limited partners in operating partnerships that develop and
operate affordable housing qualifying for federal tax credits
and a few market rate properties across the United States. The
general partners in the operating partnerships are almost
exclusively unaffiliated third-party developers. AIG does not
normally consolidate an operating partnership if the general
partner is an unaffiliated person. Through approximately 1,150
partnerships, SAAHP has invested in developments with
approximately 155,000 apartment units nationwide, and has
syndicated over $6 billion in partnership equity since 1991
to other investors who will receive, among other benefits, tax
credits under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. AIG
Retirement Services, Inc. functions as the general partner in
certain investment partnerships and acts both as a credit
enhancer in certain transactions, through differing structures
with respect to funding development costs for the operating
partnerships, and as guarantor that investors will receive the
tax benefits projected at the time of syndication. AIG
Retirement Services, Inc. consolidates these investment
partnerships as a result of the guarantee provided to the
investors. As part of their incentive compensation, certain key
SAAHP employees have been awarded residual cash flow interests
in the partnerships, subject to certain vesting requirements.
The operating income of SAAHP is reported, along with other
SunAmerica partnership income, as a component of AIG’s
Asset Management segment.

tion (CDO), collateralized loan obligation (CLO), private equity
fund or hedge fund. Such entities are typically registered
investment companies or qualify for the specialized investment
company accounting in accordance with the AICPA Investment
Company Audit and Accounting Guide. In CDO and CLO transactions,
AIG establishes a trust or other special purpose entity that
purchases a portfolio of assets such as bank loans, corporate
debt, or non-performing credits and issues trust certificates or
debt securities that represent interests in the portfolio of
assets. These transactions can be cash-based or synthetic and
are actively or passively managed. For investment partnerships,
hedge funds and private equity funds, AIG acts as the general
partner or manager of the fund and is responsible for carrying
out the investment mandate of the VIE. Often, AIG’s
insurance operations participate in these AIG managed structures
as a passive investor in the debt or equity issued by the VIE.
Typically, AIG does not provide any guarantees to the investors
in the VIE.

AIGGIC is an investor in various real estate investments. These
investments are typically with unaffiliated third-party
developers via a partnership or limited liability company
structure. Some of these entities are VIEs. The activities of
these VIEs principally consists of the development or
redevelopment of all major types of commercial (retail, office,
industrial, logistics parks, mixed use, etc.) and residential
real estate. AIG’s involvement varies from being a passive
equity investor to actively managing the activities of the VIE.

Investment Activities

As part of its investment activities, AIG’s insurance
operations invest in obligations which include debt and equity
securities and interests issued by VIEs. These investments
include investments in AIG sponsored and non-sponsored
investment funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, and
structured financing arrangements. The investments in these VIEs
allow AIG’s insurance entities to purchase assets permitted
by insurance regulations while maximizing their return on these
assets. AIG’s insurance operations typically are not
involved in the design or establishment of the VIE, nor do they
actively participate in the management of the VIE.

AIGFP

The variable interests that AIGFP may hold in VIEs include debt
securities, equity interests, loans, derivative instruments and
other credit support arrangements. Transactions associated with
VIEs include an asset-backed commercial paper conduit, asset
securitizations, collateralized debt obligations, investment
vehicles and other structured financial transactions. AIGFP
engages in these transactions to facilitate client needs for
investment purposes and to obtain funding.

AIGFP invests in preferred securities issued by VIEs.
Additionally, AIGFP establishes VIEs that issue preferred
interests to third parties and uses the proceeds to provide
financing to AIGFP subsidiaries. In certain instances, AIGFP
consolidates these VIEs.

AIGFP is the primary beneficiary of an asset-backed commercial
paper conduit with which it entered into several total return
swaps covering all the conduit’s assets that absorb the
majority of the expected losses of the entity. The assets of the
conduit serve as collateral for the conduit’s obligations.
AIGFP is also the primary beneficiary of several structured
financing transactions in which AIGFP holds the first loss
position either by investing in the equity of the VIE or
implicitly through a lending or derivative arrangement.

In certain instances, AIGFP enters into liquidity facilities
with various SPEs where AIGFP provides liquidity to the SPE in
the form of a guarantee, derivative, or a letter of credit and
does not consolidate the VIE. AIGFP also executes various swap
and option transactions with VIEs. Such contractual arrangements
are done in the ordinary course of business. Typically, interest
rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps and options
executed with VIEs are not deemed to be variable interests or
significant variable interests because the underlying is an
observable market interest rate and AIGFP as the derivative
counterparty to the VIE is senior to the debt and equity holders.

Asset Management and Insurance Activities

AIG uses VIEs in connection with certain guaranteed investment
contract programs written by its Life Insurance &
Retirement Services subsidiaries (GIC Programs). In the GIC
Programs, AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries (principally
SunAmerica Life) provide guaranteed investment contracts to VIEs
in which AIG does not have a direct variable interest, as
defined under FIN 46R, in the entity. The VIE issues notes
or bonds which are sold to third-party institutional investors.
Neither AIG nor the insurance company issuing the GICs has any
direct obligation to the investors in the notes or bonds. The
proceeds from the securities issued by the VIE are invested by
the VIE in the GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use the
proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities,
primarily investment grade bonds. Both the assets and the
liabilities of the insurance companies arising from these GIC
Programs are presented in AIG’s consolidated balance sheet.
Thus, at December 31, 2006, approximately $32 billion
of policyholders’ contract deposits represented liabilities
from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs.

Assets held by VIEs which are currently consolidated because AIG
is the primary beneficiary (except for those VIEs where AIG also
owns a majority voting interest), approximated $9.1 billion
at December 31, 2006. These consolidated assets are
reflected in AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as
Investments and Financial services assets.

Assets of VIEs where AIG has a significant variable interest and
does not consolidate the VIE because AIG is not the primary
beneficiary, approximated at $130.1 billion
December 31, 2006. Although expected losses are not
expected to be material, AIG’s maximum exposure to loss
from its involvement with these unconsolidated VIEs approximates
$38.7 billion at December 31, 2006. For this purpose,
maximum loss is considered to be the notional amount of credit
lines, guarantees and other credit support, and liquidity
facilities, the notional amounts of credit

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties
with returns linked to or “derived” from some
underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or
index. Derivative payments may be based on interest rates and
exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, commodities,
or financial or commodity indices or other variables. Collateral
is required, at the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions
based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

AIG carries all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at
fair value. The changes in fair value of the derivative
transactions of AIGFP are presented as a component of AIG’s
operating income. However, in certain instances, when income is
not recognized up front under
EITF

02-03,

income
is recognized over the life of the contract, where appropriate.

The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG
(other than those of AIGFP) that qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133.

For derivatives designated as hedges, on the date the derivative
contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as:

(i)

a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized
firm commitment (“fair value” hedge);

(ii)

a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); or

(iii)

a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign
currencies (“foreign currency hedges”). The gain or
loss in the fair value of a derivative that is appropriately and
contemporaneously documented, designated and is highly effective
as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings,
along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a
derivative that is appropriately and contemporaneously
documented, designated and is highly effective as a cash flow
hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings
are affected by the variability of cash flows in the hedged
item. Of the amount deferred in Other comprehensive income at
December 31, 2006, AIG does not expect a material amount to
be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months. The
portion of the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative in
a cash flow hedge that represents hedge ineffectiveness is
recognized immediately in current period earnings. The amount of
ineffectiveness was not material for 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is
appropriately and contemporaneously documented, designated and
is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation
adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives used for other than hedging
activities are reported in current period earnings (principally
in realized capital gains and losses for AIG’s insurance
operations). AIG had no hedges that were considered fair value
hedges or net investment hedges at December 31, 2006. At
December 31, 2006, AIG’s hedge accounting was limited
to cash flow hedge accounting primarily related to the hedge of
forecasted transactions.

AIG assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an
ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows of hedged items.

As of January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006, the
related balance of accumulated derivative net loss arising from
cash flow hedges, net of tax, was $25 million and
$28 million, respectively. Of the change in accumulated
derivative net loss $3 million represents current period
reclassifications to operating income.

In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative
instruments with respect to investment operations, which
include, among other things, credit default swaps, and
purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity
linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the fair
value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG
bifurcates an embedded derivative where:

(i)

the
economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not
clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components
of the financial instrument;

(ii)

the contract that
embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host
contract is not remeasured at fair value; and

(iii)

a separate instrument with the same terms as
the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative
under FAS 133.

The overwhelming majority of AIG’s derivatives activities
are conducted by AIGFP. AIGFP becomes a party to derivative
financial instruments in the normal course of business and to
reduce currency, interest rate, commodity, and equity exposures.
Such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial
statements and are carried at a market or a fair value,
whichever is appropriate. The recorded estimated fair values of
such instruments may be different from the values that might be
realized if AIGFP was required to sell or close out the
transactions prior to maturity.

AIGFP, in the ordinary course of operations and as principal,
structures and enters into derivative transactions to meet the
needs of counterparties who may be seeking to hedge certain
aspects of such counterparties’ operations or obtain a
desired financial exposure. AIGFP also enters into derivative
transactions to hedge the financial exposures arising from its
counterparty transactions. Such derivative transactions include
interest rate, currency, commodity, credit and equity swaps,
swaptions, and forward commitments. Interest rate swap
transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and
floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange
of the underlying notional amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a
principal in the exchange of interest payments between the
parties and, therefore, is exposed to counterparty credit risk
and may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency,
commodity, and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps,
but involve the exchange of specific currencies or cashflows
based on the underlying commodity, equity securities or indices.
Also, they may involve the exchange of notional amounts at the
beginning and end

of the transaction. Swaptions are options where the holder has
the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap
transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction. At
December 31, 2006, the aggregate notional amount of
AIGFP’s outstanding swap transactions approximated
$1,456 billion, primarily related to interest rate swaps of
approximately $1,058 billion.

Notional amount represents a standard of measurement of the
volume of swaps business of Capital Markets operations. Notional
amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and
is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Notional
amounts generally represent those amounts used to calculate
contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or
received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps.

The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to Capital
Markets foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures
and options contracts are determined by each of the respective
contractual agreements.

contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of

Futures and forward contracts are contracts that obligate the
holder to sell or purchase foreign currencies, commodities or
financial indices in which the seller/ purchaser agrees to make/
take delivery at a specified future date of a specified
instrument, at a specified price or yield. Options are contracts
that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the
underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified price and
within, or at, a specified period of time. As a writer of
options, AIGFP generally receives an option premium and then
manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the
underlying commodity, currency or index by entering into
offsetting transactions with third-party market participants.
Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices
from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the
counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At
December 31, 2006, the contractual amount of Capital
Markets futures, forward and option contracts approximated
$520.2 billion.

AIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary
course of its business. The majority of AIGFP’s credit
derivatives require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a
designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. AIGFP provides
such credit protection on a “second loss” basis, under
which AIGFP’s payment obligations arise only after credit
losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold
amount or level of “first losses.” The threshold
amount of credit losses that must be realized before AIGFP has
any payment obligation is negotiated by AIGFP for each
transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment
obligation by AIGFP under each transaction is remote, even in
severe recessionary market scenarios. At December 31, 2006
and 2005, the notional amounts of this credit derivatives
portfolio (including the super senior transactions) were
$483.6 billion and $387.2 billion, respectively.

AIG and its subsidiaries also use derivatives and other
instruments as part of its financial risk management programs.
Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used
to manage interest rate risk associated with its investments in
fixed income securities, commercial paper issuances, medium- and
long-term note offerings, and other interest rate sensitive
assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign exchange
derivatives (principally cross currency swaps, forwards and
options) are used to economically hedge non-U.S. dollar
denominated debt, net capital exposures and foreign exchange
transactions. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of
the exposures they are meant to offset.

20.

Variable Life and Annuity
    Contracts

AIG follows American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position 03-1
(SOP

03-1),

which
requires recognition of a liability for guaranteed minimum death
benefits and other living benefits related to variable annuity
and variable life contracts as well as certain disclosures for
these products.

AIG reports variable contracts through separate and variable
accounts when investment income and investment gains and losses
accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the
contract holder (traditional variable annuities), and the
separate account qualifies for separate account treatment under
SOP

03-1.

In some
foreign jurisdictions, separate accounts are not legally
insulated from general account creditors and therefore do not
qualify for separate account treatment under SOP

03-1.

In such cases,
the variable contracts are reported as general account
contracts. AIG also reports variable annuity and life contracts
through separate and variable accounts, or general accounts when
not qualified for separate account reporting, where AIG
contractually guarantees to the contract holder (variable
contracts with guarantees) either

(a)

total deposits
made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum
return (and in minor instances, no minimum returns) (Net
Deposits Plus a Minimum Return) or

(b)

the highest
contract value attained, typically on any anniversary date minus
any subsequent withdrawals following the contract anniversary
(Highest Contract Value Attained). These guarantees include
benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization,
or, in other instances, at specified dates during the
accumulation period. Such benefits are referred to as guaranteed
minimum death benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income
benefits (GMIB), and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(GMWB), or guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV),
respectively. For AIG, GMDB is by far the most widely offered
benefit.

The assets supporting the variable portion of both traditional
variable annuities and variable contracts with guarantees are
carried at fair value and reported as summary total separate and
variable account assets with an equivalent summary total
reported for liabilities when the separate account qualifies for
separate account treatment under
SOP

03-1.

Assets
for separate accounts that do not qualify for separate account
treatment are reported as trading account assets, and
liabilities are included in the respective policyholder
liability account of the general account. Amounts assessed
against the contract holders for mortality, administrative, and
other services are included in revenue and changes in
liabilities for minimum guarantees are included in incurred
policy losses and benefits in the Consolidated Statement of
Income. Separate and variable account net investment income, net
investment gains and losses, and the related liability changes
are offset within the same line item in the Consolidated
Statement of Income for those accounts that qualify for separate
account treatment under SOP 03-1. Net investment income and
gains and losses on trading accounts for contracts that do not
qualify for separate account treatment under
SOP

03-1

are
reported in net investment income and are offset by an equal
amount reported in incurred policy losses and benefits.

The vast majority of AIG’s
exposure on guarantees made to variable contract holders arises
from GMDB. Details concerning AIG’s GMDB exposures as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005 are as follows:

(a)

The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating

liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit

expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier assumptions should be revised.

The following assumptions and methodology were used to determine
the domestic and foreign GMDB liability as of December 31,
2006:

•

Data used was up to 5,000 stochastically generated investment
    performance scenarios.

•

Mean investment performance assumptions ranged from
    0 percent to approximately ten percent depending on
    the block of business.

•

Volatility assumptions ranged from 10 percent to
    30 percent depending on the block of business.

•

Mortality was assumed at between 60 percent and
    102 percent of various life and annuity mortality tables.

•

For domestic contracts, lapse rates vary by contract type and
    duration and ranged from zero percent to 40 percent. For
    Japan, lapse rates ranged from zero percent to
    20 percent depending on the type of contract.

•

For domestic contracts, the discount rate ranged from
    3.25 percent to 11 percent. For Japan, the discount
    rate ranged from zero percent to seven percent.

In addition to GMDB, AIG’s contracts currently include to a
lesser extent GMIB. The GMIB liability is determined each period
end by estimating the expected value of the annuitization
benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date
of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably over the
accumulation period based on total expected assessments. AIG
regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional
liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit
expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier assumptions should be revised. As of December 31,
2006, most of AIG’s GMIB exposure was transferred via
reinsurance agreements. Contracts with GMIB not reinsured have
account values of $21 million with a corresponding reserve
of less than $4 million.

AIG contracts currently include a minimal amount of GMAV and
GMWB. GMAV and GMWB are considered to be derivatives and are
recognized at fair value through earnings. AIG enters into
derivative contracts to partially hedge the economic exposure
that arises from GMAV and GMWB.

determined that certain non-cash activities and adjustments,
including the effects of changes in foreign exchange translation
on assets and liabilities, previously were misclassified within

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form

10-K,

an
evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the
participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of
December 31, 2006. Disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.

During the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as
of December 31, 2005 conducted during the preparation of
AIG’s financial statements to be included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2005, three material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting were identified, relating to controls over
certain balance sheet reconciliations, controls over the
accounting for certain derivative transactions and controls over
income tax accounting. As a result, AIG’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
December 31, 2005, AIG’s disclosure controls and
procedures were ineffective.

Under the direction of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, AIG continued to implement its plans to
remediate the material weaknesses, and adjusted these plans as
appropriate.

AIG’s remediation efforts were governed by a Steering
Committee, under the direction of AIG’s Chief Risk Officer
and also including AIG’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and Comptroller. The status of remediation of
each material weakness was reviewed with the Audit Committee and
this Committee was advised of issues encountered and key
decisions reached by AIG management relating to the remediation
efforts.

As of December 31, 2006 and as described under Remediation
of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting below, the material weaknesses relating to the
controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations and the
controls over the accounting for certain derivative transactions
were remediated, and the material weakness relating to the
controls over income tax accounting was not fully remediated.

As a result of the remaining material weakness in internal
control over financial reporting relating to income tax
accounting, described more fully below, AIG’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of December 31, 2006, AIG’s disclosure controls and
procedures were ineffective.

Notwithstanding the existence of this remaining material
weakness, AIG believes that the consolidated financial
statements in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K

fairly
present, in all material respects, AIG’s financial
condition as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and results of
its operations and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of AIG is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
AIG’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process, under the supervision of AIG’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of AIG’s financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

AIG management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of
AIG’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of AIG’s annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
AIG management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006,
the material weakness relating to the controls over income tax
accounting was not fully remediated.

Controls over income tax accounting:

AIG did not maintain
effective controls over the determination and reporting of
certain components of the provision for income taxes and related
income tax balances. Specifically, AIG did not maintain
effective controls to review and monitor the accuracy of the
components of the income tax provision calculations and related
income tax balances and to monitor the differences between the
income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and
liabilities to effectively reconcile the differences to the
deferred income tax balances. These control deficiencies
resulted in adjustments to income tax expense, income taxes
payable and deferred income tax asset and liability accounts in
the 2006 annual and interim consolidated financial statements.
Furthermore, these control deficiencies could result in a
material misstatement of the annual or interim

Form

10-K


AIG        177

AIG consolidated financial statements that would not be
prevented or detected. Accordingly, AIG management has concluded
that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.

As a result of the material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting described above, AIG management has
concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, AIG’s
internal control over financial reporting was not effective
based on the criteria in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of AIG’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in
this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Remediation of Material Weaknesses in
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Throughout 2006 and continuing in 2007, AIG has been actively
engaged in the implementation of remediation efforts to address
the three material weaknesses in existence at December 31,
2005. These remediation efforts, outlined below, are
specifically designed to address the material weaknesses
identified by AIG management. As a result of its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
AIG management determined that as of December 31, 2006, two
material weaknesses, relating to the controls over certain
balance sheet reconciliations and the controls over the
accounting for certain derivative transactions, had been
remediated, but the material weakness relating to the controls
over income tax accounting had not been remediated.

Controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations:

As
of December 31, 2005, AIG did not maintain effective
controls to ensure the accuracy of certain balance sheet
accounts in certain key segments of AIG’s operations,
principally in the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG). Specifically,
accounting personnel did not perform timely reconciliations and
did not properly resolve reconciling items for premium
receivables, reinsurance recoverables and intercompany accounts.

During 2006, AIG management developed and implemented a
corporate-wide accounting policy on balance sheet
reconciliations, which augments the corporate guidelines on
balance sheet reconciliations that were released in 2005. The
policy requires all reporting units to perform timely
reconciliations of their balance sheet accounts including the
resolution of reconciling items and the evaluation of exposure.

AIG reporting units, including DBG, have been performing
reconciliations of their accounts consistent with this policy.
Implementation of the new policy was supplemented with dedicated
training sessions, a self-assessment process and the continued
addition of qualified staff to monitor on-going compliance with
the new policy.

AIG continues to develop further enhancements to its controls
over certain balance sheet reconciliations. Based upon the
significant actions taken and the testing and evaluation of the
effectiveness of the controls, AIG management has concluded that
remediation of the material weakness in AIG’s controls over
certain balance sheet reconciliations had been achieved as of
December 31, 2006.

Controls over the accounting for certain derivative
transactions:

As of December 31, 2005, AIG did not
maintain effective controls over accounting for certain
derivative transactions and related assets and liabilities under
FAS 133. In particular, AIG did not maintain effective
controls over the evaluation and documentation of whether
certain derivative transactions qualified under GAAP for hedge
accounting.

During 2006, AIG management implemented effective controls over
accounting for derivative transactions. An important element of
this implementation was the hiring in key staff positions of
additional professionals with expertise in derivatives and hedge
accounting.

AIG management has established a new corporate team with the
responsibility and authority for overseeing and monitoring the
application of hedge accounting throughout AIG. This team,
staffed with accounting and quantitative professionals with
extensive experience in dealing with derivative accounting
matters, is responsible to ensure that the application of hedge
accounting by AIG or its subsidiaries is in compliance with
FAS 133 and AIG’s accounting policies. As part of this
activity, both enhancements to existing systems and investments
in new applications were made to automate certain processes with
respect to the application of hedge accounting and to reduce
reliance on manual procedures.

Based upon the significant actions taken and the testing and
evaluation of the effectiveness of the controls, AIG management
has concluded that remediation of the material weakness in
AIG’s controls over the accounting for certain derivative
transactions had been achieved as of December 31, 2006.

Continuing Remediation

Controls over income tax accounting:

As of
December 31, 2005, AIG did not maintain effective controls
over the determination and reporting of certain components of
the provision for income taxes and related income tax balances.
During 2006, AIG management took the following actions to
remediate this material weakness:

Notwithstanding these significant efforts towards remediation of
the material weakness in controls over income tax accounting,
implementation and testing of the standard key controls, as well

178       AIG


Form

10-K

American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

as procedures and processes, were not completed within all
business units as of December 31, 2006. As a result, the
effectiveness and sustainability of controls and processes could
not be assured as of that date.

Furthermore, during 2006, the reconciliation, evaluation and
monitoring of historical balance sheet income tax accounts
identified errors in the income tax balances. The errors
identified to date were not material; therefore, they were
recorded and disclosed in the period in which they were
identified. AIG has not completed the necessary reconciliation
and evaluation of all historical balance sheet income tax
accounts; accordingly, additional work is required in the
analysis of the remaining prior year balances. AIG cannot
predict the outcome of the review and analysis described above
or estimate the potential adjustments related to these
remediation activities. However, in the opinion of AIG
management and based upon information currently known,
resolution of these historical balance sheet income tax accounts
is not likely to have a material adverse effect on AIG’s
consolidated financial condition, but it is possible that the
effect could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for an individual reporting period.

Remediation of the material weakness in controls over income tax
accounting requires completing the implementation of key
controls in the applicable AIG business units and testing them
after they are in place to validate their effectiveness and
sustainability. Due to the nature of these requirements and the
need to complete the reconciliation of certain historical
balances, no assurance can be given as to the specific timing of
the remediation of this material weakness. AIG management
continues to assign the highest priority to AIG’s
remediation efforts in this area, with the goal of remediating
this material weakness by year-end 2007.

While the material weakness in controls over income tax
accounting was not remediated, due to the substantive
alternative procedures performed and compensating controls in
place, AIG believes that the consolidated financial statements
present fairly in all material respects AIG’s financial
condition as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and results of
its operations and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, in conformity with GAAP.

AIG recognizes that improvement in its internal controls over
financial reporting and consolidation processes, as well as
those over investment accounting, is essential. Over time, AIG
intends to reduce its reliance on the manual controls that have
been established. AIG is currently developing new systems and
processes which will allow it to rely on front end detection and
preventative controls which will be more sustainable over the
long term. AIG recognizes that, to accomplish its goals, further
strengthening and investing are needed in financial personnel,
as well as in systems and processes. AIG is committed to making
the investments necessary to make these improvements.
