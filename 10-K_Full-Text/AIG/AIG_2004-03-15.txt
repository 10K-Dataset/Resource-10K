PART I

ITEM 1.

Business

American International Group, Inc. (AIG), a
Delaware corporation, is a holding company, which through its
subsidiaries, is engaged in a broad range of insurance and
insurance-related activities in the United States and abroad.
AIG’s primary activities include both General and Life
Insurance operations. Other significant activities include
Financial Services, and Retirement Services & Asset
Management. The principal General Insurance company subsidiaries
are American Home Assurance Company (American Home), National
Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (National
Union), New Hampshire Insurance Company (New Hampshire),
Lexington Insurance Company (Lexington), The Hartford Steam
Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB), Transatlantic
Reinsurance Company, American International Underwriters
Overseas, Ltd. (AIUO) and United Guaranty Residential
Insurance Company. Significant Life Insurance operations include
those conducted through American Life Insurance Company (ALICO),
American International Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (AIRCO),
American International Assurance Company, Limited together with
American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited
(AIA), Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (Nan Shan), AIG
Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (AIG Star Life), AIG Annuity
Insurance Company (AIG Annuity), the AIG American General Life
Companies (AIG American General), and SunAmerica Life Insurance
Company (SunAmerica Life). AIG’s Financial Services
operations are conducted primarily through International Lease
Finance Corporation (ILFC), AIG Financial Products Corp. and its
subsidiaries (AIGFP), and American General Finance, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (AGF), while Retirement Services & Asset
Management operations include The Variable Annuity Life
Insurance Company (VALIC), AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp.
(SAAMCo), AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company and AIG Global
Asset Management Holdings Corp. (formerly known as AIG Global
Investment Group, Inc.) and its subsidiaries and affiliated
companies (AIG Global Investment Group).

On August 29, 2001, AIG acquired American
General Corporation (AGC). In connection with the acquisition,
AIG issued approximately 290 million shares of common
stock, $2.50 par value per share (common stock) in an exchange
for all the outstanding common stock of AGC based on an exchange
ratio of 0.5790 of a share of AIG common stock for each share of
AGC common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling
of interests and all prior historical financial information
presented herein has been restated to include AGC. For
information on AIG’s business segments, see Note 2 of Notes
to Financial Statements.

All per share information herein gives
retroactive effect to all stock dividends and stock splits. As
of January 31, 2004, beneficial ownership of approximately
11.9 percent, 2.0 percent and 1.8 percent of AIG
common stock, was held by Starr International Company, Inc.
(SICO), The Starr Foundation and C.V. Starr & Co., Inc.
(Starr), respectively.

At December 31, 2003, AIG and its
subsidiaries had approximately 86,000 employees.

AIG’s Internet address for its corporate
website is

www.aigcorporate.com

. AIG makes available free
of charge, on or through the Investor Information section of
AIG’s corporate website, Annual Reports on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after
such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Throughout this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, AIG presents its operations in the way it
believes will be most meaningful, as well as most transparent.
Certain of the measurements used by AIG management are
“non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules and
regulations. Gross premiums written, statutory underwriting
profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in accordance
with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory
authorities. For an explanation of why AIG management considers
these “non-GAAP measures” useful to investors, see
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, after
    completion of its annual review of General Insurance loss and
    loss adjustment expense reserves, AIG increased its net loss
    reserves pertaining to accident years 1997 through 2001 by
    $2.8 billion. Excluding the loss reserve charge, the
    General Insurance combined ratio would have been 94.4.

The following table shows identifiable assets,

Financial Statements.)

General Insurance Operations

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are
multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of
property and casualty insurance. Domestic General Insurance
operations are comprised of the Domestic Brokerage Group (DBG),
which includes the operations of HSB; Transatlantic Holdings,
Inc. (Transatlantic); Personal Lines, including 21st Century
Insurance Group (21st Century); and United Guaranty
Corporation (UGC).

AIG’s primary domestic division is DBG.
DBG’s business is derived from brokers in the United States
and Canada and is conducted through its General Insurance
subsidiaries including American Home, National Union, Lexington
and certain other General Insurance company subsidiaries of AIG.
The AIG Risk Management operation provides insurance and risk
management programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk
Finance division designs and implements risk financing
alternatives using the insurance and financial services
capabilities of AIG. Also included in DBG are the operations of
AIG Environmental, which focuses specifically on providing
specialty products to clients with environmental exposures.

DBG writes substantially all classes of business
insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers.
This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets
and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to
submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company
contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no
authority to commit DBG to accept a risk.

In addition to writing substantially all classes
of business insurance, including large commercial or industrial
property insurance, excess liability, inland marine,
environmental, workers’ compensation and excess and
umbrella coverages, DBG offers many specialized forms of
insurance such as equipment breakdown, directors and officers
liability, difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom, export
credit and political risk, and various types of professional
errors and omissions coverages. Lexington writes surplus lines,
those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not
readily provide insurance coverage, either because of complexity
or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional
contracts.

Transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity on both
treaty and facultative basis. Transatlantic structures programs
for a full range of property and casualty products with an
emphasis on specialty risk.

AIG engages in mass marketing of personal lines
coverages, primarily private passenger auto and personal
umbrella coverages, principally through American International
Insur-

ance Company and 21st Century. In 2003, AIG
acquired the U.S.-based auto and home insurance business of
General Electric Company (GE).

The business of UGC and its subsidiaries is also
included in the domestic operations of AIG. The principal
business of the UGC subsidiaries is the writing of residential
mortgage loan insurance, which is guaranty insurance on
conventional first mortgage loans on single-family dwellings and
condominiums. Such insurance protects lenders against loss if
borrowers default. UGC subsidiaries also write home equity and
property improvement loan insurance on loans to finance
residential property improvements, alterations and repairs and
for other purposes not necessarily related to real estate.
During 2003, UGC commenced providing guaranty insurance to
providers of student loans. UGC had approximately
$22 billion of guaranty risk in-force at December 31,
2003.

AIG’s Foreign General insurance group
accepts risks primarily underwritten through American
International Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of
wholly owned agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign
General insurance group also includes business written by
AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for their own
accounts. The Foreign General group uses various marketing
methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with
certain refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU
operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, Middle East
and Latin America.

During 2003, DBG and the Foreign General
insurance group accounted for 57.0 percent and
21.5 percent, respectively, of AIG’s General Insurance
net premiums written.

AIG’s General Insurance company subsidiaries
worldwide operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks
for their direct account and securing reinsurance on that
portion of the risk in excess of the limit which they wish to
retain. This operating policy differs from that of many
insurance companies which will underwrite only up to their net
retention limit, thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure
commitments from other underwriters for the remainder of the
gross risk amount.

The utilization of reinsurance is closely
monitored by an internal reinsurance security committee,
consisting of members of AIG’s senior management. No single
reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG’s
business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract.
(See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

AIG is diversified both in terms of lines of
business and geographic locations. Of the General Insurance
lines of business, workers’ compensation was approximately
12 percent of AIG’s net premiums written. This line of
business is also diversified geographically.

The majority of AIG’s General Insurance
business is in the casualty classes, which tend to involve
longer periods of time for the reporting and settling of claims.
This may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to
AIG’s loss reserve development. (See also the Discussion
and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve
Development and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

Loss and expense ratios of AIG’s
consolidated General Insurance operations are set forth in the
following table. (See also Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.)

(a)

Excluding the net loss reserve charge of
    $2.8 billion, the General Insurance combined ratio would
    have been 94.4.

(b)

Excluding WTC losses of $769 million, the
    General Insurance combined ratio would have been 96.7.

(c)

Source: Best’s Aggregates & Averages
    (Stock insurance companies, after dividends to policyholders):
    the ratio for 2003 was obtained from Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. and
    reflects estimated results.

During 2003, of the direct General Insurance
premiums written (gross premiums less return premiums and
cancellations, excluding reinsurance assumed and before
deducting reinsurance ceded), 11.0 percent,
7.6 percent and 6.4 percent were written in
California, Illinois and New York, respectively. No other state
accounted for more than 5 percent of such premiums.

There was no significant adverse effect on
AIG’s General Insurance results of operations from the
economic environments in any one state, country or geographic
region for the year ended December 31, 2003. (See also
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.)

FORM 10-K : 4

Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss
    Expense Reserve Development

The reserve for net losses and loss expenses
represents the accumulation of estimates for reported losses
(“case basis reserves”) and provisions for losses
incurred but not reported (IBNR), both reduced by applicable
reinsurance recoverable. Losses and loss expenses are charged to
income as incurred.

Loss reserves established with respect to foreign
business are set and monitored in terms of the respective local
or functional currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for
changes in currency rates. (See also Note 1(w) of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

Management reviews the adequacy of established
loss reserves through the utilization of a number of analytical
reserve development techniques. Through the use of these
techniques, management is able to monitor the adequacy of its
established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for
inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development
patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and
IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required
adjustments. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

The “Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and
Loss Expense Reserve Development Excluding Asbestos and
Environmental Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve
Development” table, which follows, presents the development
of net losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1993
through 2003. The upper half of the table shows the cumulative
amounts paid during successive years related to the opening loss
reserves. For example, with respect to the net losses and loss
expense reserve of $19.66 billion as of December 31,
1996, by the end of 2003 (seven years later) $16.30 billion
had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the
original reserve of $19.66 billion was reestimated to be
$19.11 billion at December 31, 2003. This decrease
from the original estimate would generally be a combination of a
number of factors, including reserves being settled for smaller
amounts than originally estimated. The original estimates will
also be increased or decreased as more information becomes known
about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and
severity patterns. The redundancy (deficiency) depicted in the
table, for any particular calendar year, shows the aggregate
change in estimates over the period of years subsequent to the
calendar year reflected at the top of the respective column
heading. For example, the deficiency of $1.54 billion at
December 31, 2003 related to December 31, 2002 net
losses and loss expense reserves of $29.65 billion
represents the cumulative amount by which reserves for 2002 and
prior years have developed deficiently during 2003. The
deficiency that has emerged in the last year can be attributed
primarily to claims from accident years 1999 and 2000. The
accident year emergence can be seen by comparing the respective
developments in 2003 for each column’s loss reserve in the
table below. For example, the liability associated with the year
end 2000 loss reserves increased to $30.12 billion at year
end 2003 from $28.26 billion at year end 2002, an increase
of $1.86 billion in 2003. Thus, loss estimates for accident
years 2000 and prior, which comprise the year end 2000 loss
reserve, increased by $1.86 billion during 2003. Similarly,
the table shows that the loss estimates for accident years 1999
and prior, which comprise the year end 1999 loss reserve,
increased to $28.10 billion at year end 2003 from
$26.95 billion at year end 2002, an increase of
approximately $1.15 billion. This increase of
$1.15 billion, as compared to the $1.86 billion
increase in the 2000 column, indicates that accident year 2000
loss estimates increased by approximately $710 million
during 2003, i.e. the difference between the respective
$1.86 billion and $1.15 billion amounts. Similar
calculations from the table below reveal that the accident year
1999 loss estimates increased approximately $600 million
during 2003. Thus, loss estimates for accident years 1999 and
2000 increased by approximately $1.3 billion during 2003.
Loss estimates also increased for accident years 1998 and prior,
but by amounts small in comparison to 1999 and 2000. The primary
cause of these higher loss estimates is higher than expected
loss emergence in 2003. Loss development patterns utilized to
test the reserves generally rely on the actual historical loss
development patterns of prior accident years for each class of
business. Accident years 1999 and 2000 exhibited significantly
higher than normal loss development in the latest calendar year,
thus creating the adverse developments noted above. The classes
accounting for the majority of this higher than expected loss
emergence in 2003 were excess casualty, directors and
officers’ liability, and healthcare liability. It should be
noted that loss estimates for accident years 2001 and 2002 did
not develop adversely in 2003. Additionally, as shown in the
table below, loss emergence from year end 1993, 1994, 1995 and
1996 has been favorable on an inception to date basis through
year end 2003.

The reserve for net losses and loss expenses with
respect to Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in
the consolidated net losses and loss expenses commencing with
the year ended December 31, 1998. Reserve development for
these operations is included only for the 1998 and subsequent
periods. Thus, the comparisons for 1997 and prior year ends are
not fully comparable to those for 1998 and subsequent in the
table below.

December 31, 2003, differs from the total reserve reported
in the Annual Statements filed with state insurance departments
and, where appropriate, with foreign regulatory authorities. The
differences at December 31, 2003 relate primarily to
reserves for certain foreign operations. (See also

Life Insurance Operations

AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries offer a
wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment
products both domestically and abroad. Traditional products
consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and
accident and health policies. Financial and investment products
consist of fixed and variable annuities, guaranteed investment
contracts and pensions. (See also Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

Life Insurance operations in foreign countries
comprised 78.0 percent of GAAP Life premiums and
59.7 percent of life operating income in 2003. AIG operates
overseas principally through ALICO, AIA and Nan Shan. ALICO is
incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written
outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either
directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, Africa, Latin
America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far
East, with Japan being the largest territory. AIG added
significantly to its presence in Japan with the acquisition of
GE Edison Life Insurance Company, (now known as AIG Edison Life
Insurance Company) (AIG Edison Life), in 2003 and AIG Star Life
in 2001, as a result of the reorganization of Chiyoda Mutual
Life Insurance Company. AIA operates primarily in China
(including Hong Kong), Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Nan
Shan operates in Taiwan. (See also Note 2 of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

FORM 10-K : 8

AIG’s principal domestic Life Insurance
operations include AIG American General Life, AIG Annuity and
SunAmerica Life. These companies utilize multiple distribution
channels including brokerage and career and general agents to
offer traditional life products as well as financial and
investment products. The domestic life operations comprised
22.0 percent of total GAAP Life premiums in 2003.

There was no significant adverse effect on
AIG’s Life Insurance results of operations from economic
environments in any one state, country or geographic region for
the year ended December 31, 2003. (See also
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.)

Traditional Life Insurance products such as whole
life and endowment continue to be significant in the overseas
companies, especially in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of
traditional, accident and health and financial products are sold
in Japan.

In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary
operations in the Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Poland,
Switzerland and Puerto Rico, and conducts life insurance
business through AIUO subsidiary companies in Russia, Israel and
in certain countries in Central and South America.

The foreign life companies have over 230,000
career agents and sell their products largely to indigenous
persons in local currencies. In addition to the agency outlets,
these companies also distribute their products through direct
marketing channels, such as mass marketing, and through brokers
and other distribution outlets such as financial institutions.

Insurance Investment Operations

A significant portion of AIG’s general and
life operating revenues are derived from AIG’s insurance
investment operations.

AIG’s worldwide insurance investment policy
places primary emphasis on investments in high quality, fixed
income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser
extent, investments in marketable common stocks, in order to
preserve policyholders’ surplus and generate net investment
income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited
in certain territories as there may be a lack of qualified long
term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by
the local regulatory authorities. (See also Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.)

Financial Services Operations

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage
in diversified financial products and services including
aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, and consumer and
insurance premium financing.

AIG’s Aircraft Finance Operations represent
the operations of ILFC which engages primarily in the
acquisition of commercial jet aircraft and the leasing and
remarketing of such aircraft to airlines around the world. Also,
ILFC provides, for a fee, fleet management services to certain
third-party operators. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

During the third quarter, AIG integrated the
operations of AIG Trading Group Inc. (AIGTG) into AIGFP
thereby establishing the Capital Markets reporting unit. AIGFP
engages as principal in standard and customized interest rate,
currency, equity, and credit products with top tier
corporations, financial institutions, governments, agencies,
institutional investors, and high net worth individuals
throughout the world. AIGFP also raises funds through municipal
re-investment contracts and other private and public security
offerings, investing the proceeds in a diversified portfolio of
high grade securities and derivative transactions. AIGTG engages
in various commodity and foreign exchange trading and market
making activities. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

AIG’s Consumer Finance operations include
AGF as well as AIG Consumer Finance Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). (See
also Note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

AGF provides a wide variety of consumer finance
products, including real estate mortgages, consumer loans,
retail sales finance and credit related insurance to customers
in the United States.

AIGCFG, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in
developing a multi-product consumer finance business with an
emphasis on emerging markets.

Together Aircraft Finance, Capital Markets and
AIG’s Consumer Finance operations comprise the vast
majority of the commissions, transaction and other fees of
AIG’s consolidated financial services operations.

Imperial A.I. Credit Companies also contribute to
financial services income. This operation engages principally in
insurance premium financing. (See also Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Retirement Services & Asset Management Operations

AIG’s Retirement Services & Asset
Management operations offer a wide variety of investment
products, including variable annuities and mutual funds, as well
as investment services, such as investment asset management.
Such products and services are offered to individuals and
institutions both domestically and overseas.

AIG’s principal Retirement Services &
Asset Management operations are conducted through AIG Retirement
Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIG SunAmerica), VALIC and
its related marketing entities (AIG VALIC) and AIG Global
Investment Group. AIG SunAmerica develops and sells variable
annuities and other investment products, sells and manages
mutual funds and provides financial services. AIG VALIC provides
tax qualified annuities to the employees of educational,
healthcare and governmental entities. AIG Global Investment

securities lending and custodial services and organizes and
manages the invested assets of institutional private equity
investment funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives
fees for investment products and services provided. (See also
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and Note 1 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

Other Operations

Certain other AIG subsidiaries provide
insurance-related services such as adjusting claims and
marketing specialized products. AIG also has several other
subsidiaries which engage in various businesses. For example,
American International Technology Enterprises, Inc. provides
information technology and processing services to businesses
worldwide. Mt. Mansfield Company, Inc. owns and operates the ski
slopes, lifts, school and an inn located at Stowe, Vermont.

Additional Investments

AIG holds a 24.3 percent interest in IPC
Holdings, Ltd., a reinsurance holding company, a
23.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings,
Ltd., a property-casualty insurance holding company, and a
22.1 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance
Co., Ltd., a general insurance company. (See also Note 1(q) of
Notes to Financial Statements.)

Locations of Certain Assets

As of December 31, 2003, approximately
30 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located
in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $3.05
billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign
regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held
abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in
foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes,
nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by
consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such
occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country
to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or
nationalization does occur, AIG’s policy is to take all
appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of
the countries in which AIG’s business is conducted have
currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a
company’s ability to repatriate assets and profits. (See
also Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

Regulation and Competition

Certain states require registration and periodic
reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such
states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable
legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning
the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the
other companies in the holding company system and prior approval
of intercorporate transfers of assets (including in some
instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary)
within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are
registered under such legislation in those states that have such
requirements. (See also Note 11 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with
other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the
states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business.
Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies
but generally has its source in statutes that delegate
regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The
regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of
policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be
met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements,
the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and
limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks
that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of
securities for the benefit of policyholders, methods of
accounting, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance
companies, the form and content of reports of financial
condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned
premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation
is for the protection of policyholders rather than security
holders. (See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure
the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation
to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately
capitalized General and Life Insurance companies may be
identified.

The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target
level of statutory surplus by applying certain factors to
various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are
applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to
less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus
varies not only as a result of the insurer’s size, but also
on the risk profile of the insurer’s operations.

The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental
levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is
below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range
in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for
corrective action to actually placing the insurer under
regulatory control.

The risk-based adjusted surplus of each of
AIG’s Domestic General and Life Insurance subsidiaries
exceeded their RBC standards as of December 31, 2003.

To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance
entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would
be AIG’s intention to infuse necessary capital to support
that entity.

Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
became fully effective in 2001. These provisions established
consumer protections regarding the security and confidentiality
of nonpublic personal information and require full disclosure of
the privacy policies of financial institutions to their consumer
customers. There is also legislation pending in the United
States Congress and various states designed to provide
additional privacy protections to consumer customers of
financial institutions. These statutes and similar legislation
and regulations in the United States or other jurisdictions
could impact AIG’s ability to market its products or
otherwise limit the nature or scope of AIG’s Insurance and
Financial Services operations.

FORM 10-K : 11

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

A substantial portion of AIG’s General
Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business
is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and
supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some
to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the
underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must
satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by
foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to
modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other
AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in
certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In
the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to
conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions.

In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s
foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions
with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and
type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount
and type of local investment and the share of profits to be
returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some
foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies.
Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions,
wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted
insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on
terms which do not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG,
full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing
constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may
hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

The insurance industry is highly competitive.
Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance
subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,000 other stock
companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies
and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries
offering Life Insurance and Retirement Services compete in the
United States with approximately 1,800 life insurance companies
and other participants in related financial service fields.
Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign
insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers and local
companies in particular areas in which they are active.

AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and
Asset Management operations operate in a highly competitive and
increasingly regulated environment, both domestically and
overseas. Principal sources of competition are banks, investment
banks and other non-bank financial institutions. The focus of
AIG’s operations has also become more consumer-oriented,
thereby increasing the risks of regulatory supervision and
intervention.

ITEM 2.

Properties

AIG and its subsidiaries operate from
approximately 2,200 offices in the United States, 9 offices in
Canada and numerous offices in approximately 100 foreign
countries. The offices in Springfield, Illinois; Amarillo,
Ft. Worth and Houston, Texas; Wilmington, Delaware; Hato
Rey and Isabella, Puerto Rico; Tampa, Florida; Livingston, New
Jersey; Evansville, Indiana; Nashville, Tennessee; 70 Pine
Street, 72 Wall Street and 175 Water Street in New
York City; and offices in approximately 30 foreign
countries including Bermuda, Chile, Hong Kong, the Philippines,
Japan, United Kingdom, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and
Thailand are located in buildings owned by AIG and its
subsidiaries. The remainder of the office space utilized by AIG
subsidiaries is leased.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the
insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation,
including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of
their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
future operating results or liquidity. (See also the Discussion
and Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve
Development and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.)

In late 2002, a shareholder derivative action was
filed in Delaware Chancery Court alleging breaches of fiduciary
duty of loyalty and care against AIG’s directors.
AIG’s management believes the allegations of the complaint
are without merit. AIG’s Board of Directors appointed a
special committee of independent directors to review the
complaint and respond to the lawsuit. The special committee has
issued a report that concluded that it was not in the best
interests of AIG or its shareholders to pursue the litigation
and moved the Delaware Chancery Court to terminate the
litigation. Discovery is ongoing relating to that motion.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG
presents its operations in the way it believes will be most
meaningful. Gross premiums written, statutory underwriting
profit (loss) and combined ratios are presented in
accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance
regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of
performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more
meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors.
AIG has also incorporated into this discussion a number of
parenthetical cross-references to additional information
included throughout this Form 10-K to assist readers seeking
related information on a particular subject.

Introduction and Executive Summary

AIG’s operations in 2003 were conducted by
its subsidiaries principally through four operating
segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services
and Retirement Services & Asset Management. Through
these segments, AIG provided insurance and investment products
and services to both businesses and individuals in over
130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic product
and service diversification is one of AIG’s major strengths
and sets it apart from its competitors. Although regional
economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively impact
parts of AIG’s operations, AIG believes that this
diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties
would have a material impact on its operating results, financial
condition or liquidity.

AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial,
institutional and individual customers through an extensive
property-casualty and life insurance network. In the United
States, AIG companies are the largest underwriter of commercial
and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance
operations as well. AIG’s Financial Services businesses
include commercial aircraft leasing, capital markets and
consumer finance, both in the United States and abroad. AIG also
has one of the largest retirement services business in the
United States and provides asset management services to
institutions and individuals.

AIG’s 2003 performance reflects
implementation of various long-term strategies and defined goals
in its various operating segments.

A primary goal of AIG in managing its General
Insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting
profit – maintaining a combined loss and expense ratio
under 100. To achieve this end, AIG is disciplined in its risk
selection and premiums must be adequate to cover the risk
accepted. AIG believes in strict control of expenses, so it
historically has one of the lowest expense ratios in the
industry.

AIG patiently builds relationships in markets
around the world where it sees long-term growth opportunities.
For example, AIG’s ability to expand its Chinese operations
more quickly and extensively than its competitors is the result
of relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIG’s more
recent extensions of operations into India, Brazil, Russia and
other emerging markets follow the same pattern. Moreover, AIG
believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of
these countries and growing with them. When AIG companies enter
a new jurisdiction, they typically offer both basic protection
and savings products. As the economies evolve, AIG’s
products evolve with them, to more complex and
investment-oriented models.

Another central focus of AIG operations in
current years is the development and expansion of new
distribution channels. In late 2003, AIG entered into an
agreement with the Peoples Insurance Company of China (PICC)
which will enable AIG companies to market accident and health
products throughout China through PICC’s agency system.
Other examples of new distribution channels used both
domestically and overseas include banks, affinity groups and
e-commerce.

Growth for AIG may be generated both internally
and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and
offer adequate return on investment. In recent years, the
acquisitions of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life have broadened
AIG’s penetration of the Japanese market, the second
largest for life insurance in the world. These acquisitions
broadened AIG’s distribution channels and will result in
operating efficiencies as they are integrated into AIG’s
previously existing companies operating in Japan.

AIG provides leadership on issues of concern to
the global and local economies as well as the insurance and
financial services industries. In recent years, tort reform and
legislation to deal with the asbestos problem have been key
issues, while in prior years trade legislation and superfund
have been issues of concern.

The following table summarizes AIG’s
revenues, income before income taxes, minority interest and
cumulative effect of accounting changes and net income for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001:

FORM 10-K : 17

American International Group, Inc. and

Consolidated Results

The 20.5 percent growth in revenues in 2003
was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned
from global General Insurance operations as well as growth in
both General Insurance and Life Insurance net investment income
and GAAP Life premiums. Additionally, net realized capital
losses declined $1.0 billion in 2003 over 2002.

AIG’s income before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change increased
70.8 percent in 2003 when compared to 2002. General
Insurance and Life Insurance operating income gains, together
with the reduction of realized capital losses as well as the
impact of the loss reserve charge in 2002, were the primary
factors for the increase over 2002 in both pretax income and net
income.

The following table summarizes the operations
of each principal segment for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. (See also Note 2 of Notes
to Financial Statements.)

General Insurance

AIG’s General Insurance operations provide
property and casualty products and services throughout the
world. The increase in General Insurance operating income in
2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributable to strong
growth in operating income with respect to Domestic Brokerage
Group’s and Foreign General’s operations in 2003 and
the impact of the loss reserve charge of $2.8 billion in
2002. In addition, the level of realized capital losses with
respect to General Insurance operations declined to
$172 million in 2003 from $858 million in 2002.
General Insurance operating income in 2002 was substantially
lower than 2001 due to the $2.8 billion reserve charge in
2002.

Life Insurance

AIG’s Life Insurance operations provide
traditional, financial and investment products throughout the
world. AIG’s foreign operations provide over
50 percent of AIG’s Life Insurance operating income.

Life Insurance operating income increased by 21.8
percent in 2003. This increase resulted from growth in each of
AIG’s principal life insurance businesses, and the decline
in realized capital losses to $826 million in 2003 from
$1.05 billion in 2002. Life Insurance operating income grew
in 2002 relative to 2001. This growth rate was negatively
impacted by substantial increase in realized capital losses in
2002, compared to the $254 million realized capital losses
in 2001.

Financial Services

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage
in diversified financial products and services including
aircraft leasing, capital market transactions and consumer and
insurance premium financing.

Financial Services operating income increased in
2003 compared to 2002 and in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting
operating income growth derived from a broadened range of
businesses and products in each year.

Retirement Services & Asset
Management

AIG’s Retirement Services & Asset
Management operations provide a wide variety of investment
products, including variable annuities and mutual funds, as well
as investment services, such as asset management. These products
and services are offered to individuals, government agencies and
institutions both domestically and overseas.

Retirement Services & Asset Management
operating income increased 25.1 percent in 2003 when
compared to 2002 as a result of the upturn in worldwide
financial markets and the improved U.S. economic conditions;
operating income declined 6.6 percent in 2002 when compared
to 2001 due to the depressed markets and economic environment.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

Realized Capital Losses

AIG incurred net realized capital losses of
$1.43 billion in 2003, $2.44 billion in 2002 and
$836 million in 2001. The realized capital losses in each
year reflect primarily impairment loss provisions. Upon the
ultimate disposition of these holdings, a portion of these
losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions.

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2003, AIG had total
shareholders’ equity of $71.25 billion and total
borrowings of $77.28 billion. At that date,
$69.63 billion of such borrowings were either not
guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations
of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or matched notes and
bonds payable.

During 2003, AIG repurchased in the open market
3,822,500 shares of its common stock.

Liquidity

At December 31, 2003, consolidated invested
assets were $525.23 billion including $9.84 billion in
cash and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided
from operating activities in 2003 amounted to
$36.16 billion. AIG believes that its liquid assets, cash
provided by operations and access to the capital markets will
enable it to meet any forseeable cash requirements.

Outlook

Overall, premium rates in the General Insurance
business have continued to be strong both domestically and in
key international markets, although the rates of increase have
moderated in most lines and begun to fall in certain classes.
AIG also continues to be able to modify and limit its
contractual obligations by adding appropriate exclusions and
policy restrictions. AIG expects total premiums to increase for
2004 resulting in positive growth in cash flow for investments.
Thus, General Insurance net investment income is expected to
rise in future quarters even in the current low interest rate
environment.

In October 2003, AIG entered into an agreement
with PICC that will enable AIG to market its accident and health
products through PICC’s 4,300 branch offices throughout the
country. PICC has over 70 percent of the non-life market in
China and AIG expects substantial opportunity for growth through
this new distribution channel.

In the Life Insurance segment, AIG expects
overall continued growth through expansion in China, where AIG
was the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly
owned Life Insurance operations in eight major cities, as well
as in India, Korea and Vietnam.

AIG Edison Life was acquired in August of 2003.
AIG Edison Life adds to the current agency force in Japan, and
provides alternative distribution channels including banks,
financial advisers, and corporate and government employee
relationships. AIG Edison Life’s integration into
AIG’s existing Japanese operations will provide future
operating efficiencies.

Domestically, AIG expects continued strong
operating growth in 2004 as distribution channels are expanded
and new products are introduced.

In the airline industry, changes in market
conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results.
Therefore, AIG believes that improvements in that market
commencing in 2003 will be gradually reflected in ILFC’s
results in 2004. In the Capital Markets operations, the
integration of AIG Trading Group Inc. (AIGTG) into the AIGFP
operations created operating efficiencies that will continue to
be realized and product synergies that should enhance 2004
results. AIG also expects increased contributions to Financial
Services revenues and income from its consumer finance
operations both domestically, as a result of the improving
economy, and overseas, as expansion of credit card operations
continues and economic conditions improve.

AIG expects both its Retirement Services
operations and its Asset Management operations to continue to
benefit from the recovery in the equity markets and global
economy.

AIG has many promising growth initiatives
underway around the world in its insurance and other operations.
Cooperative agreements such as those in Russia and with the PICC
are expected to expand distribution networks for AIG’s
products and investment opportunities and provide models for
future growth.

Critical Accounting Estimates

AIG considers its most critical accounting
estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss
expenses, future policy benefits for life and accident and
health contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs, and fair
value determinations for certain Capital Markets assets and
liabilities. These accounting estimates require the use of
assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at
the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs
from the assumptions used, AIG’s results of operations
would be directly impacted.

FORM 10-K : 19

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,
AIG’s critical accounting estimates are discussed in
detail. The major categories for which assumptions are developed
and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are
highlighted below.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses (General
Insurance):

•

Loss trend factors:

used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident
    years based on the projected loss ratio with respect to prior
    accident years.

•

Expected loss ratios for the latest accident
    year:

in this case, accident year 2003
    for the year end 2003 loss reserve analysis. For low frequency,
    high severity classes such as Excess Casualty and Directors and
    Officers’ Liability, expected loss ratios generally are
    utilized for at least the three most recent accident years.

•

Loss development
    factors:

used to project the reported
    losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount.

Future Policy Benefits for Life and Accident
and Health Contracts (Life Insurance):

•

Interest rates:

which vary by territory, year of issuance and products.

•

Mortality, morbidity and surrender
    rates:

based upon actual experience by
    geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy
    form.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs (General
Insurance):

•

Recoverability based upon the current
    profitability of the underlying insurance contracts.

Life Insurance and Retirement
Services & Asset Management:

•

Estimated gross
    profits:

to be realized over the
    estimated duration of the contracts (nontraditional life).
    Estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and
    losses on investments less required interest, actual mortality
    and other expenses.

Fair Value Determinations of Certain Assets
and Liabilities (Financial Services — Capital
Markets):

•

Valuation models:

utilizing factors, such as market liquidity and current
    interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates.

•

AIG attempts to secure reliable and independent
    current market price data, such as published exchange rates from
    external subscription services such as Bloomberg or Reuters or
    third party broker quotes for use in this model. When such
    prices are not available, AIG uses an internal methodology,
    which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable
    prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of
    the transactions.

Operating Review

General Insurance Operations

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are
multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of
property and casualty insurance both domestically and abroad.

Domestic General Insurance operations are
comprised of DBG, which includes HSB; Transatlantic; Personal
Lines, including 21st Century; and UGC (Mortgage Guaranty).

DBG is AIG’s primary domestic general
division. DBG writes substantially all classes of business
insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers.
This provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets
and retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to
submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company
contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no
authority to commit DBG to accept a risk.

Transatlantic offers, through its reinsurance
company subsidiaries, reinsurance capacity, both domestically
and overseas, on a treaty and facultative basis for a full range
of property and casualty products.

Personal Lines engages in the mass marketing of
personal lines insurance, primarily private passenger auto and
personal umbrella coverages, as well as providing comprehensive
insurance coverage to high net-worth households through its
Private Client Group.

UGC provides guaranty insurance to mortgage
providers primarily with respect to conventional first mortgage
loans on single family dwellings and condominiums. During 2003,
UGC commenced providing guaranty insurance to providers of
student loans.

AIG’s Foreign General insurance group
accepts risks primarily underwritten through AIU, a marketing
unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities.
The Foreign General insurance group also includes business
written by AIG’s foreign-based insurance subsidiaries for
their own accounts. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

As previously noted, AIG believes it should
present and discuss its financial information in a manner most
meaningful to its investors. Accordingly, in its General
Insurance business, AIG uses certain non-GAAP measures, where
AIG has determined these measurements to be useful and
meaningful.

A critical discipline of a successful general
insurance business is the objective to produce operating income
from underwriting exclusive of investment related income. When
underwriting is not profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay
for insured losses and underwriting related expenses. In these
situations, the addition of general insurance related in-

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

(continued)

vestment income and realized capital gains may,
however, enable a general insurance business to produce
operating income. If underwriting losses persist over extended
periods, an insurance company will likely not continue to exist
as a going concern. For these reasons, AIG views underwriting
profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance.
Although in and of itself not a GAAP measurement, AIG believes
this measurement is a useful and meaningful disclosure. (See
also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.)

General Insurance operating income is
comprised of underwriting profit (loss), net investment income
and realized capital gains and losses. These components, as well
as net premiums written, net premiums earned and statutory
ratios for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

(a)

Includes loss reserve charge of
    $2.8 billion in the aggregate.

(b)

Includes WTC losses of $769 million in
    the aggregate.

(c)

Includes 21st Century’s loss
    adjustment expense pretax provision of $43 million for
    SB1899 Northridge earthquake claims.

(d)

The impact of the loss reserve charge and the
    WTC losses on the loss ratio was an increase of 11.54 in 2002
    and 3.97 in 2001.

General Insurance Results

Net premiums written are initially deferred and
earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net
unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are
generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net
unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums
earned until the end of the policy period.

Commencing in the latter part of 1999 and
continuing through 2003, the commercial property-casualty market
place has experienced premium rate increases. Virtually all
areas of DBG have experienced premium rate increases as well as
maintaining an excellent retention rate for desired renewal
business. The vast majority of the net premiums written increase
in 2003 resulted from rate increases with respect to renewed
business. Overall, DBG’s net premiums written increased in
2003 and 2002. Adjusting this growth for cancelled or nonrenewed
business, such growth would have approximated 38 percent in
2003 and 56 percent in 2002. AIG believes that these
premium rate increases will continue into 2004 particularly with
respect to long tail lines of business where the insurer’s
stability is critical to the insured. Based on historical
patterns, AIG believes that overall growth in net premiums
written will slow as competition for premiums increases in
certain lines of business.

FORM 10-K : 21

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

Personal Lines’ net premiums written for
2003 includes $159 million from the domestic insurance
operations of GE that were acquired in August. The increase in
net premiums written apart from this acquisition resulted from
increased marketing efforts as well as rate increases in several
states. The increase in underwriting profits in 2003 and 2002
result from premium rate increases and growth in net premiums
written. Underwriting profits are expected to continue to
increase through 2004 as a result of continued marketing
efforts, loss cost stabilization and the full year impact of the
acquisition.

Mortgage Guaranty’s net premiums written
increased 4.7 percent in 2003 over 2002 primarily due to
its entry into student loan insurance market beginning in early
2003. The residential first mortgage operation was negatively
impacted by refinancing fueled by low interest rates. AIG
anticipates continued growth in Mortgage Guaranty in 2004
resulting from a full year of student loan insurance operations.
Also, as the number of refinancings decreases, persistency
should improve on the first mortgage book and renewal premiums
are expected to increase. Underwriting profit should recover
from the decrease shown in 2003 which resulted from the adverse
impact on net premiums earned from the refinancing activities.

Foreign General insurance net premiums written
growth was due to premium rate increases as well as flight to
quality. The regions that had the strongest premium growth were
Western Europe and UK/Ireland. Although AIG expects growth in
Foreign General commercial lines rates to decelerate in 2004,
Foreign General has commenced various initiatives with respect
to target markets, products, and distribution to offset this
decline.

In comparing the foreign currency exchange rates
used to translate the results of AIG’s Foreign General
operations during 2003 to those foreign currency exchange rates
used to translate AIG’s Foreign General results during
2002, the U.S. dollar weakened slightly in value in
relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG transacts
business. Accordingly, when foreign net premiums written were
translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total
General Insurance net premiums written were approximately
1.9 percentage points more than they would have been if
translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which
prevailed during 2002.

AIG, along with most General Insurance entities,
uses the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as
measures of performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses and
loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The
expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net
premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss
ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative
measurements that describe for every $100 of net premiums earned
or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses,
respectively. The combined ratio presents the total cost per
$100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100
demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100
demonstrates underwriting loss.

The 2003 domestic and foreign combined ratios
improved over last year’s ratios primarily because the
growth in net premiums exceeded the growth in expenses,
continued expense control in 2003 and the impact of the
$2.8 billion loss reserve charge in 2002.

Underwriting profit is measured in two ways:
statutory underwriting profit and Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) underwriting profit.

Statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by
reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses
incurred and net expenses incurred. Statutory accounting
generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the
matching of revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is,
for statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not
over the same period that the revenues are earned.

A basic premise of GAAP accounting is the
recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned,
the accounting principle of matching. Therefore, to convert
underwriting results to a GAAP basis, acquisition expenses are
deferred (deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)) and amortized
over the period the related net premiums written are earned.
Accordingly, the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted
as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required
by GAAP. DAC is reviewed for recoverability and such review
requires management judgment. (See also Critical Accounting
Estimates herein and Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

The underwriting environment varies from country
to country, as does the degree of litigation activity.
Regulation, product type and competition have a direct impact on
pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in
underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

In 2002, AIG’s General Insurance results
reflect the net impact of the loss reserve charge of
$2.8 billion with respect to accident years 1997 through
2001. Such charge was the result of AIG’s annual year-end
review of General Insurance loss reserves. (See also the
discussion under “2002 Loss Reserve Charge” herein.)
In addition, these results reflect the net impact of catastrophe
losses approximating $57 million in 2002, and
$867 million in 2001 (which include $769 million in
WTC losses and $50 million with respect to the Northridge
earthquake, following the unprecedented decision by the State of
California to require all insurers to reopen claims nearly eight
years after the occurrence). On a gross basis, incurred losses
included $3.5 billion attributable to the loss reserve
charge and approximately $245 million from catastrophes in
2002, and catastrophe losses of $2.15 billion in 2001
(which include $2.0 billion in WTC losses).

The effects of catastrophes incurred in 2003 were
insignificant. The impact of losses caused by catastrophes can
fluctuate widely from year to year, making comparisons of
recurring type business more difficult. With respect to
catastrophe losses, AIG believes that it has taken appropriate
steps, such as careful exposure selection and obtaining
reinsurance coverage, to reduce the impact of the magnitude of
possible future losses. The occurrence of one or more
catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity, such
as a terrorist attack, earthquake or hurricane, that causes
insured losses, however, could have a material adverse effect on
AIG’s results of operations, liquidity or financial
condition.

General Insurance net investment
income

grew in 2003 when compared to
2002. The invested cash flow resulting from the growth in net
premiums written in this and prior periods had a positive impact
on net investment income. In 2002, net investment income
decreased when compared to 2001. The decrease in net investment
income in 2002 was primarily a result of lower earnings with
respect to the general insurance private equity portfolio. Also,
interest income earned from the General Insurance bond portfolio
was impacted by lower yields as the proceeds from maturing fixed
income securities were reinvested. As AIG believes that net
premiums written will continue to increase in 2004, it is
expected that cash flow for investment will continue to grow as
well. As a result, net investment income is expected to grow in
2004. (See also the discussion under “Liquidity”
herein and Note 8 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

Realized gains and losses resulted from the
ongoing investment management of the General Insurance
portfolios within the overall objectives of the General
Insurance operations and were reflective of weakness in the
equity markets in early 2003 and prior periods and impairment
loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings in all
three years. (See the discussion on “Valuation of Invested
Assets” herein.)

The increase in General Insurance operating
income in 2003 was primarily attributable to strong profitable
growth in DBG’s and Foreign General’s operations, the
decrease in realized capital losses relative to prior periods
and the impact of the loss reserve charge in 2002. The decline
in the growth rate in 2002 was caused by the $2.8 billion
loss reserve charge as well as the $728 million increase in
realized capital losses in 2002.

The contribution of General Insurance operating
income to AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes,
minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes
was 36.5 percent in 2003 compared to 8.2 percent in
2002 and 35.0 percent in 2001. The increase over 2002 and
the decrease of 2002 compared to 2001 was a result of the $2.8
billion loss reserve charge in 2002.

Reinsurance

AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its
General Insurance operations. AIG is cognizant of the need to
exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both
domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance
programs. AIG insures risks globally and its reinsurance
programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG the level
of reinsurance protection that AIG desires. AIG purchases
reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure. However, one
or more catastrophe losses could negatively impact AIG’s
reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG to collect
reinsurance recoverables. AIG’s reinsurance department
evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of
occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use
of state of the art industry recognized program models among
other techniques. AIG supplements these models through
continually monitoring the risk exposure of AIG’s worldwide
general insurance operations and adjusting such models
accordingly. While reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG
from its direct obligations to its insureds, an efficient and
effective reinsurance program substantially limits AIG’s
probable losses.

FORM 10-K : 23

American International Group, Inc. and

AIG’s general reinsurance
assets

amounted to $26.76 billion
and resulted from AIG’s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a
credit exposure existed at December 31, 2003 with respect
to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may
not be able to reimburse AIG under the terms of these
reinsurance arrangements. AIG manages its credit risk in its
reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it
considers financially sound, and when necessary AIG holds
substantial collateral in the form of funds, securities and/or
irrevocable letters of credit. This collateral can be drawn on
for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on
an individual reinsurer basis. At December 31, 2003,
approximately 47 percent of the general reinsurance assets
were from unauthorized reinsurers. In order to obtain statutory
recognition, the majority of these balances were collateralized.
The remaining 53 percent of the general reinsurance assets
were from authorized reinsurers. The terms authorized and
unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories, not
creditworthiness. Approximately 90 percent of the balances
with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated
A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A
(strong) or better, as rated by Standard & Poor’s.
This rating is a measure of financial strength.

AIG maintains an allowance for estimated
unrecoverable reinsurance and has been largely successful in its
previous recovery efforts. At December 31, 2003, AIG had
allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating
$140 million. At that date, AIG had no significant
reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is
financially troubled (e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in
receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal
regulatory restriction).

AIG’s Reinsurance Security Department
conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets
and current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic.
Such assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if
a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, and has sufficient
financial capacity, and the local economic environment in which
a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the
nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral. For
example, in AIG’s treaty reinsurance contracts, AIG
includes credit triggers that require a reinsurer to post
collateral when a referenced event occurs. Such credit triggers
include, but are not limited to, insurer financial strength
rating downgrades, policyholder surplus declines at or below a
certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of
a reinsurance recoverable being reached. In addition, AIG’s
Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and
concentrations with any one reinsurer.

AIG enters into certain intercompany reinsurance
transactions for its general and life operations. AIG enters
these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in
or-der to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance
risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements
have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities.
All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

At December 31, 2003, the consolidated
general reinsurance assets of $26.76 billion include
reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of
$3.59 billion and $19.47 billion with respect to the
ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses, including ceded
losses incurred but not reported (IBNR) (ceded reserves). The
ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of
ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and
loss expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and
to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually
reviewed and updated. Any adjustments thereto are reflected in
income currently. It is AIG’s belief that the ceded
reserves at December 31, 2003 were representative of the
ultimate losses recoverable. In the future, as the ceded
reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts, the ultimate
loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves
currently ceded.

Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses

The table below classifies as of
December 31, 2003 the components of the General Insurance
reserve for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) with
respect to major lines of business on a statutory
basis*:

*

Presented pursuant to statutory reporting
    requirements as prescribed by the National Association of
    Insurance Commissioners.

These loss reserves represent the accumulation of
estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and loss expenses.

At December 31, 2003, General Insurance net
loss reserves increased $5.91 billion from the prior year
end to $36.65 billion. The net loss reserves represent loss
reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables, net of an
allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance. The methods used to
determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves
are continually reviewed and updated. Any adjustments resulting

FORM 10-K : 24

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

therefrom are reflected in operating income
currently. It is management’s belief that the General
Insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all General
Insurance net losses and loss expenses as at December 31,
2003. While AIG annually reviews the adequacy of established
loss reserves, there can be no assurance that AIG’s
ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially
exceed AIG’s loss reserves as of December 31, 2003. In
the future, if the general insurance net loss reserves develop
deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse impact on
future results of operations. See “2002 Loss Reserve
Charge” herein.

In a very broad sense, the General Insurance loss
reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups, one group
being long tail casualty lines of business. Such lines include
excess and umbrella liability, directors and officers’
liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, general
liability, products’ liability, and related classes. The
other group is short tail lines of business consisting
principally of property lines, personal lines and certain
classes of casualty lines.

For operations writing short tail coverages, such
as property coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss
reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate
reserve level for the outstanding exposure, rather than
determining an expected loss ratio for current business. For
example, the IBNR reserve required for a class of property
business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the
latest year’s earned premiums, and this level of reserve
would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the
current quarter. The 20 percent factor is adjusted to
reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known
exposures to large unreported losses, or other factors affecting
the particular class of business.

Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss
expenses (net losses) for long tail casualty lines of business
is a complex process and depends on a number of factors,
including the line and volume of the business involved.
Experience in the more recent accident years of long tail
casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported
net losses. That is, a relatively low proportion of net losses
would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller
proportion would be net losses paid. A relatively high
proportion of net losses would therefore be IBNR.

AIG’s carried net long tail loss reserves
are tested using loss trend factors that AIG considers most
appropriate for each class of business. A variety of actuarial
methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net
losses for long tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily
involve theuse of loss trend factors intended to reflect the
estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to
the next. For the majority of long tail casualty lines, net loss
trend factors approximated six percent. Loss trend factors
reflect many items including changes in claims handling,
exposure and policy forms; current and future estimates of
monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in
litigation and awards. These factors are periodically reviewed
and subsequently adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging
trends which are based upon past loss experience. Thus, many
factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year
growth in loss costs recognized.

A number of actuarial assumptions are made in the
review of reserves for each line of business.

For longer tail lines of business, actuarial
assumptions generally are made with respect to the following:

•

Loss trend factors which are used to establish
    expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the
    projected loss ratio for prior accident years.

•

Expected loss ratios for the latest accident year
    (i.e., accident year 2003 for the year end 2003 loss reserve
    analysis) and in some cases, for accident years prior to the
    latest accident year. The expected loss ratio generally reflects
    the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for
    the loss trend (See 1 above) and the impact of rate changes
    and other quantifiable factors. For low-frequency, high-severity
    classes such as Excess Casualty and Directors and Officers
    Liability (D & O), expected loss ratios generally
    are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years.

•

Loss development factors which are used to
    project the reported losses for each accident year to an
    ultimate basis.

AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves
for each of its many General Insurance profit centers. The
overall change in AIG’s loss reserves is based on the sum
of these profit center level changes. For most profit centers
which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage, the
process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves
determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of
coverage. This loss ratio is multiplied by the current
quarter’s net earned premium for that class of coverage to
determine the quarter’s total estimated net incurred loss
and loss expense. The change in loss reserves for the quarter
for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred
loss and loss expense, estimated as described above, and the net
paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter.

FORM 10-K : 25

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

The process of determining the current loss ratio
for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers
in the latter part of the previous year. The loss ratios
determined for each profit center are based on a variety of
factors. These include, but are not limited to, the following
considerations: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios;
actual and anticipated rate changes; actual and anticipated
changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; actual and
anticipated changes in external factors impacting results, such
as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment.
Each profit center’s loss ratio for the following year is
subject to review by the profit center’s management, by
actuarial and accounting staffs, and ultimately by senior
management. At the close of each quarter, the assumptions
underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss
ratios based thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a
review of the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual
rate changes achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance
or mix of business, and changes in certain other factors that
may affect the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the
initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the
loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the
revised assumptions.

A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is
conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each AIG
General Insurance subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in
full detail for each class or line of business for each
subsidiary, and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual
analyses. The purpose of these reviews is to confirm the
reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual
subsidiaries, and thereby of AIG’s overall carried
reserves. The reserve analysis for each business class is
performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with
that class of business. In completing these detailed actuarial
reserve analyses, the actuaries are required to make numerous
assumptions, including for example the selection of loss
development factors and loss cost trend factors. They are also
required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial
method(s) to employ for each business class. Additionally, they
must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments
from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately
tested. In the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each
business segment, a point estimate of the loss reserve is
generally determined. The sum of these point estimates for each
of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides
an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that
subsidiary. The overall actuarial point estimate is compared to
the subsidiary’s carried loss reserve. If the carried
reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions
which are also believed to be reasonable, then the carried
reserve wouldgenerally be considered reasonable and no
adjustment would be considered. The ultimate process by which
the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only
the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors.
Other crucial internal and external factors considered include a
qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic
conditions in the United States and abroad, changes in the
legal, regulatory, judicial and social environments, underlying
policy pricing, terms and conditions, and claims handling.

In the 2002 year-end actuarial loss reserve
analysis for DBG, the more recent accident years showed
significant increases in loss development for the excess
casualty and directors and officers’ liability classes, as
well as lesser amounts in certain other classes including
healthcare liability. As a result, the actuaries performing the
loss reserve analyses for these classes modified their
historical assumptions in producing the point estimate of
required reserves. A key modification was to give additional
weight to the actual loss development in the immature years. For
example, for the excess casualty lead umbrella class, the actual
loss developments for accident year 1999 were used, even though
that development normally would have been considered too
immature to produce reliable results (and therefore, not used
under historical assumptions). Another key change for the most
recent accident years (generally accident years 2000, 2001 and
2002) was, although the actuaries continued to use actuarial
assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the
results of prior accident years, the expected loss ratio
assumptions used gave far greater weight to more recent accident
year experience than was the case in the historical assumptions.
Thus for the excess casualty lead umbrella class described
above, the actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results
of the 1997 through 1999 accident years only, giving no weight
to the more favorable development of all prior years, in setting
expected loss ratio assumptions for accident years 2000 to 2002.
Again, using the lead umbrella class as an example, rather than
using the historical loss trend factor of 2.5 percent per
year as actually experienced, the actuaries used
7.5 percent as the annual loss cost trend factor,
reflecting the more current experience. As a result of the
modified assumptions, the actuaries developed a second point
estimate of the net loss reserve for DBG. (See “2002 Loss
Reserve Charge” herein.)

With respect to the 2003 year-end actuarial loss
reserve analysis for DBG, the actuaries continued to utilize the
modified assumptions as described above, with appropriate
adjustments to account for the additional year of loss
experience which emerged in 2003. For example, in setting the
expected loss ratios for accident years 2001, 2002 and 2003 for
the

FORM 10-K : 26

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

excess casualty lead umbrella class, the
actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results of the 1997
through 2000 accident years only, giving no weight to the more
favorable development of accident years prior to 1997. In
addition, they continued to utilize the 7.5 percent annual
loss cost trend factor.

Loss development trends for long tail lines such
as Excess Casualty and D&O, however, have not followed any
consistent trend. This has at times led to overstated loss ratio
projections and is a key reason why the actuaries have
customarily utilized the historical projection method, which
gave more weight to the experience of older, more mature
accident years. For long tail lines, judgment is required in
analyzing the appropriate weighting of current trends to avoid
overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such current
trends. Given the accuracy of the historical approach and the
uncertainty of the more recent trends, AIG management decided to
give approximately equal weight to the point estimate of the
required reserve resulting from the historical assumptions and
the point estimate of the required reserve from the modified
assumptions described above in determining the actual loss
reserve carried at year-end 2003.

AIG’s annual loss reserve does not calculate
a range of loss reserve estimates. Because AIG’s General
Insurance business is primarily in long tail casualty lines
driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of
claims, developing a range around loss reserve estimates would
not be meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIG’s
actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required
reserve. This amount is evaluated against actual carried
reserves. It must be understood that there is the potential for
significant variation in the actual results versus the
assumptions used to test the reserves, particularly for the long
tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty. As an
example, for the lead umbrella segment of the excess casualty
class of business, a 5 percent change in the assumed loss
cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause
approximately a $300 million impact (either positively or
negatively) in the net loss and loss expense reserve position
for that segment. In the early 1990’s actual loss cost
trends were negative for the excess casualty class, whereas in
the late 1990’s they spiked significantly and ran well into
the double digits. Thus, while the 7.5 percent assumption
used in the modified assumptions for both year-end 2002 and 2003
is believed to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that
actual loss trends will not deviate significantly from this
assumption. Another key assumption for long tail classes such as
excess casualty is the loss development factors which are
utilized to project thereported losses for each year to an
ultimate basis. Generally, actual historical loss development
factors are used to project future loss development. However,
there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns
will be the same as in the past. Again using the excess casualty
class as an example, if future loss development factors differed
by 5 percent from those utilized in the year-end 2003 loss
reserve review, there would be approximately a $300 million
impact to the overall AIG loss reserve position.

In 2002, following completion of its annual
year-end net loss reserve study, AIG increased General Insurance
loss and loss adjustment reserves, incurring a net, after-tax
charge of $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002. The
$1.8 billion was largely attributable to the “Other
Liability Occurrence” and “Other Liability Claims
Made” lines of business, and accident years 1997 through
2001.

Asbestos and Environmental
Reserves

AIG continues to receive claims asserting
injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other
environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the
cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to
collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims
asserting injuries from asbestos.

The vast majority of these asbestos and
environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and
prior years. Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an
absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute
asbestos exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently
underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a
claims made basis and has excluded such claims from this
analyses.

The majority of AIG’s exposures for asbestos
and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not
primary coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the
same manner as indemnity reserves. That is, litigation expenses
are included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs.
Individual significant claim liabilities, where future
litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on
a case basis.

Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims
loss reserves is a complex process. These asbestos and
environmental claims cannot be estimated by AIG using
conventional reserving techniques as previously described.
Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the
asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the
inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations
which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage.
The current case law can be characterized as still evolving and
there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop
in the

FORM 10-K : 27

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

near future. Additionally, the exposure for
cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such
as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible
parties and the government’s refusal to release parties.

Due to this uncertainty it is not possible to
determine the future development of asbestos and environmental
claims with the same degree of reliability as is with other
types of claims. Such future development will be affected by the
extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the
policies and the scope of the coverage, as they have in the
past, as well as by the changes in Superfund and waste dump site
coverage issues. AIG and other industry members will continue to
litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy
coverage and the liability issues.

Although the estimated liabilities with respect
to asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to a
significantly greater margin of error than for other loss
reserves, the asbestos and environmental reserves carried at
December 31, 2003 are believed to be adequate as these
reserves are based on the known facts and current law.
Furthermore, as AIG’s net exposure retained relative to the
gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years, the
potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss
reserves than on the gross loss reserves. However, if the
asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently, such
deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of
operations. (See the previous discussion on reinsurance
collectibility herein.) AIG does not discount its asbestos and
environmental reserves.

With respect to known asbestos and environmental
claims, AIG established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort
and environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all
such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate
these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a
comprehensive ground up approach on a claim-by-claim basis. The
asbestos and environmental claims are reserved to ultimate
probable loss based upon known facts, current law, jurisdiction,
policy language and other factors. Each claim is reviewed at
least semi-annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and
adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information.

In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos
and environmental claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues
early settlement with respect to these claims thereby reducing
its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims.

With respect to asbestos claims reserves, AIG has
resolved all claims with respect to miners and major
manufacturers (Tier 1), and payments have been completed or
reserves are established to cover future payment
obligations.Asbestos claims with respect to products containing
asbestos (Tier 2), are generally very mature losses, and
have been appropriately recognized and reserved by AIG’s
asbestos claims operation. AIG believes that the vast majority
of the incoming claims with respect to products containing small
amounts of asbestos, companies in the distribution chain and
parties with remote, ill-defined involvement with asbestos
(Tier 3 and 4), should not impact its coverage. This is due
to a combination of factors, including the increasingly
peripheral companies being named in asbestos litigation, smaller
limits issued to peripheral defendants, tenuous liability cases
against peripheral defendants, attachment points of the excess
policies, and the manner in which resolution of these weaker
cases would be allocated among all insurers, including non-AIG
companies, over a long period of time.

AIG believes the majority of its known long-tail
environmental exposures have been resolved utilizing a
combination of pro-active claim-handling techniques including
policy buybacks, complete environmental releases, compromise
settlements, and, where indicated, litigation. Current and new
claims are generally cases of declining severity. Strong
coverage defenses (including late notice) and stronger liability
defenses are among the factors contributing to declining
severity.

AIG uses primarily two methods to test the
adequacy of its asbestos and environmental reserves, including
the related IBNR, the Market Share method and the Frequency/
Severity method. The Market Share method produces indicated
asbestos and environmental reserves needs by applying the
appropriate AIG company market share to estimated potential
industry ultimate loss and loss expenses based on the latest
estimates from A.M. Best and Tillinghast.

The second method, the frequency/ severity
approach, utilizes current information as the basis of an
analysis that predicts for each of the next ten years a number
with respect to future expected environmental claims and the
average severity of each. The estimated trend in frequency is
based upon assumptions judged by AIG to be the most reasonable.
The trend in severity starts with severities based on current
actual average severity using the varying case adequacy
assumptions and trending forward under assumptions deemed most
reasonable by AIG. A similar frequency/ severity analysis is
also performed for asbestos. However, future asbestos claims
(IBNR) are projected for each of the next twenty years.

Quantitative techniques frequently have to be
supplemented by subjective consideration, including managerial
judgment, to assure management satisfaction that the overall
reserves are adequate to meet projected losses.

A summary of reserve activity, including

environmental claims separately and combined at
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 follows:

*

All amounts pertain to policies underwritten

The gross and net IBNR included in the

2002 and 2001 were estimated as follows:

A summary of asbestos and environmental claims
count activity for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 was as follows:

A.M. Best, an insurance rating agency, has
developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it
would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and
environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on
that company’s current level of asbestos and environmental
claims payments. This is a ratio derived by taking the current
ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the
average annual payments for the prior three years. Therefore,
the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the
number of years it would be before the current ending losses and
loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average
payments. The higher the ratio, the more years the reserves for
losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments. These
ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and
lossexpenses over the respective claims settlement during the
fiscal year. Such payments include indemnity payments and legal
and loss adjustment payments. It should be noted, however, that
this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos
and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as
aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and level of
coverage provided, have a significant impact on the amount of
asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves,
ultimate payments made and the resultant ratio.

AIG believes that voluntary payments with respect
to environmental claims should be excluded from the calculation
of the survival ratio for the environmental claims. That is,
involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court

FORM 10-K : 29

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

judgments, court orders, covered claims with no
coverage defenses, state mandated clean up costs, claims where
AIG’s coverage defenses are minimal and settlements that
are made less than six months before the first trial setting.
Payments other than these are deemed voluntary because AIG can
control the amount and timing of such payments, if any.

AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos and
environmental claims, separately and combined, excluding
voluntary environmental claim payments, were based upon a three
year average payment. These ratios for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

Life Insurance Operations

AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries offer a
wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment
products both domestically and abroad. Traditional products
consist of individual and group life, annuity, endowment and
accident and health policies. Financial and investment products
consist of fixed and variable annuities, guaranteed investment
contracts and pensions. (See also Note 2 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

Domestically, AIG offers a broad range of
protection and interest sensitive accumulation products,
including life insurance and fixed annuities. Home service
operations include an array of traditional and investment type
products sold through agents. Group life and health products and
pension and investment products include structured settlements
and terminal pension funding.

Overseas, AIG’s Life Insurance operations
include traditional products such as whole and term life and
endowments, personal accident products and group products
including life and health.

Guaranteed investment contracts, also known as
funding agreements (GICs), are sold domestically and abroad to
both institutions and individuals. These products are written on
anopportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable.
Thus, production, cash flow and net investment income
attributable to GICs will vary from one reporting period to the
next.

Life Insurance operations presented on a major
product basis for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

Life Insurance Results

The increase in operating income in 2003 was
caused in part by strong growth, particularly overseas, and
lower realized capital losses. The lower growth rate in 2002 was
primarily a result of increased realized capital losses over
2001.

The contribution of Life Insurance operating
income to AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes,
minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes
amounted to 43.2 percent in 2003 compared to
60.5 percent in 2002 and 57.4 percent in 2001. The
decline in 2003 resulted from General Insurance operating income
growing significantly. The contribution rate in 2002 and 2001
was influenced by the poor performance in General Insurance
resulting in the reduced contribution of General Insurance to
income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative
effect of accounting changes.

Since AIG purchased AIG Star Life, a part of the
income earned by AIG Star Life has resulted from surrender
charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or
lapsed. This favorable impact on operating income was
anticipated when AIG acquired AIG Star Life. As these surrenders
diminish in subsequent years, operating income from that source
will also diminish. The majority of AIG Star Life’s future
income will be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal
business, and new business to be generated from a growing agency
force and new product sales to current insureds.

Domestically, the growth is predominantly
attributable to Pension and Investment Products, Life Insurance
and Group Life/Health. With respect to Foreign Life, the
majority of the growth in GAAP life premiums was attributable to
the Life Insurance and Personal Accident lines of business. This
growth was most significant in Southeast Asia where AIG
maintains significant market share established by its strong
agency force, and in Japan, where AIG is benefiting from a
flight to quality. Foreign Life operations produced
78.0 percent, 77.3 percent and 74.0 percent of
the GAAP life premiums in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

As previously discussed, the U.S. dollar weakened
in relation to most major foreign currencies in which AIG
transacts business. Accordingly, for 2003, when foreign life
premiums were translated into U.S. dollars for purposes of the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, total life
premiums were approximately 2.6 percentage points more than
they would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates
prevailing in 2002.

The growth in net investment income in 2003 was
attributable to both foreign and domestic invested new cash flow
for investment as well as improved returns on nontraditional
investments. Domestically, this cash flow was generated from
Life Insurance and individual annuity operations. Overseas, cash
flow was generated primarily from Life Insurance operations.
Additionally, net investment income was positively impacted by
the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net
investment income. (See also the discussion under
“Liquidity” herein.)

Life Insurance investment portfolios are managed
within the overall objectives of the Life Insurance operations.
Life Insurance realized capital losses reflect weaknesses in the
equity markets in the early months of 2003 and the prior years
as well as impairment loss provisions for certain equity and
fixed income holdings. (See also the discussion on
“Valuation of Invested Assets” herein.)

Underwriting and Investment
Risk

The risks associated with the traditional life
and accident and health products are underwriting risk and
investment risk. The risk associated with the financial and
investment contract products is primarily investment risk.

Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss
resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging
in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing
associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses.
The emergence of significant adverse experience would require an
adjustment to the benefit reserves that could have a substantial
impact with respect to AIG’s results of operations.

AIG’s foreign life companies limit their
maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a
single life to approximately $1.5 million of coverage and
AIG’s domestic life companies generally limit their maximum
underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single
life to $2.5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable
term reinsurance. (See also Note 5 of Notes to Financial
Statements and the discussion under “Liquidity”
herein.)

The investment risk represents the exposure to
loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets,
primarily long-term fixed rate investments, being less than the
cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected
policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on
investments. (See also the discussion under
“Liquidity” herein.)

To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG
tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and
contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to
assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit. If a
rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract
claims became necessary and did not occur, a demand could be
placed upon liquidity. (See also the discussion under
“Liquidity” herein.)

FORM 10-K : 31

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

The asset-liability relationship is appropriately
managed in AIG’s foreign operations, as it has been
throughout AIG’s history, even though certain territories
lack qualified long-term investments or there are investment
restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities. For
example, in Japan and several Southeast Asia territories, the
duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than
the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities.
Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds
at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield
below that of the interest required for the accretion of the
policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future
investment risk associated with certain policies currently in
force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is,
the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a
yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.

To maintain an adequate yield to match the
interest necessary to support future policy liabilities,
constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds
of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium
receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment
quality.

To the extent permitted under local regulation,
AIG may invest in qualified longer-term securities outside Japan
to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required
yield. AIG is able to manage any asset-liability duration
difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity
and to support any operational shortfall through its
international financial network. (See also the discussion under
“Liquidity” herein.)

Certain foreign jurisdictions have limited
long-dated bond markets and AIG may use alternative investments,
including equities and foreign denominated fixed income
instruments to extend the effective duration of the investment
portfolio to more closely match that of the policyholder
liabilities.

The asset-liability relationship is appropriately
managed in AIG’s domestic operations, as there is ample
supply of qualified long-term investments.

AIG uses asset-liability matching as a management
tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested
assets and appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these
strategies, AIG may determine that it is economically
advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to
anticipated interest rate or other economic changes.

A number of guaranteed benefits are offered on
certain variable life products. (Included in the
“Accounting Standards” section is a discussion of new
accounting guidance for these benefits.)

DAC for life insurance products arises from
the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are directly
related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business. Policy
acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are
generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period
of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to
universal life and investment-type products (nontraditional life
products) are deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation
to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross
profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the
contracts. Estimated gross profits include investment income and
gains and losses on investments less interest required as well
as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and
expenses. Current experience and changes in the expected future
gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the
amortization of DAC. The estimation of projected gross profits
requires significant management judgment. The elements with
respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed
and analyzed quarterly and are appropriately adjusted.

DAC for both traditional life and nontraditional
life products are subject to review for recoverability, which
involve estimating the future profitability of current business.
This review also involves significant management judgment. If
the actual emergence of future profitability were to be
substantially different than that estimated, AIG’s results
of operations could be significantly impacted. (See also
Note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

Insurance Invested Assets

AIG’s general strategy is to invest in high
quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid
significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country
concentrations. With respect to General Insurance, AIG’s
strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to
maximize the yields at the date of purchase. With respect to
Life Insurance, AIG’s strategy is to produce cash flows
required to meet maturing insurance liabilities. (See also the
discussion under “Operating Review: Life Insurance
Operations” herein.) AIG invests in equities for various
reasons, including diversifying its overall exposure to interest
rate risk. Equity securities are subject to declines in fair
value. Such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of investments, net of taxes as a
component of comprehensive income. Generally, insurance
regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance
company may invest. When permitted by regulatory authorities and
when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including
invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its
insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as
end users. (See also the discussion under
“Derivatives” herein.)

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory
and/or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit
the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries
or from the insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent. These barriers
generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of
the funds.

The following tables summarize the composition
of AIG’s insurance invested assets by insurance segment, at
December 31, 2003 and 2002:

(a)

Includes $282 million of bond trading
    securities, at market value.

(b)

Includes $1.90 billion of nonredeemable
    preferred stocks, at market value.

(a)

Includes $981 million of bond trading
    securities, at market value.

(b)

Includes $1.58 billion of nonredeemable
    preferred stocks, at market value.

Credit Quality

At December 31, 2003, approximately
65 percent of the fixed maturities investments were
domestic securities. Approximately 33 percent of such
domestic securities were rated AAA by one or more of the
principal rating agencies. Approximately 7 percent were
below investment grade or not rated.

A significant portion of the foreign insurance
fixed income portfolio is rated by Moody’s, Standard &
Poor’s (S&P) or similar foreign services. Similar
credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas
locations. AIG annually reviews the credit quality of the
foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including
mortgages. At December 31, 2003, approximately 17 percent
of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated AAA
or, on the basis of AIG’s internal analysis, were
equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated.
Approximately 7 percent were below investment grade or not
rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign insurance
fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities
supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance.

Any fixed income security may be subject to
downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance
sheet date.

Valuation of Invested Assets

The valuation of invested assets involves
obtaining a market value for each security. The source for the
market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer
quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities.

Another aspect of valuation is an assessment of
impairment. As a matter of policy, the determination that a
security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value
and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of
AIG’s management and a continual review of its investments.

FORM 10-K : 33

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

In general, a security is considered a candidate
for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria:

•

Trading at a significant discount to par,
    amortized cost (if lower) or cost for an extended period of time;

•

The occurrence of a discrete credit event
    resulting in

(i)

the issuer defaulting on a material
    outstanding obligation; or

(ii)

the issuer seeking
    protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any
    similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of
    insolvent enterprises; or

(iii)

the issuer proposing
    a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked
    to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair
    value substantially lower than par value of their claims; or

•

In the opinion of AIG’s management, it is
    possible that AIG may not realize a full recovery on its
    investment, irrespective of the occurrence of one of the
    foregoing events.

Once a security has been identified as impaired,
the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that
security’s contemporaneous market price.

AIG has the ability to hold any security to its
stated maturity. Therefore, the decision to sell reflects the
judgment of AIG’s management that the security sold is
unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis, as attractive a
return in the future as alternative securities entailing
comparable risks. With respect to distressed securities, the
sale decision reflects management’s judgment that the
risk-discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the
value achievable on sale.

As a result of these policies, AIG recorded in
2003 impairment losses net of taxes of approximately
$1.3 billion.

No impairment charge with respect to any one
single credit was significant to AIG’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations, and no individual
impairment loss exceeded 1.3 percent of consolidated net
income for 2003.

Excluding the impairments noted above, the
changes in market value for AIG’s available for sale
portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIG’s
investments, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income as unrealized gains or losses.

At December 31, 2003, the unrealized losses
after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately
$1.4 billion. At December 31, 2003, the unrealized
losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were
approximately $44 million.

At December 31, 2003, aggregate unrealized
gains after taxes were $10.4 billion and aggregate
unrealized losses after taxes were $1.5 billion. No single
issuer accounted for more than three percent of the unrealized
losses.

At December 31, 2003, the fair value of
AIG’s fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to
$319.0 billion. Of this aggregate fair value,
0.35 percent represented securities trading at or below
75 percent of amortized cost or cost.

The impact on net income of unrealized losses
after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization, because
certain realized losses will be charged to participating
policyholder accounts, or realization will result in current
decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition
costs.

At December 31, 2003, the unrealized
losses after taxes for fixed maturity securities and equity
securities included the following industry
concentrations:

The amortized cost of fixed maturities
available for sale in an unrealized loss position at
December 31, 2003, by contractual maturity, is shown
below:

In the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the
sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were
$3.2 billion. The aggregate fair value of securities sold
was $32.2 billion, which was approximately 91 percent
of amortized cost. The average period of time that securities
sold at a loss during the twelve months ended December 31,
2003 were trading continuously at a price below book value was
approximately seven months.

FORM 10-K : 34

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

At December 31, 2003, aggregate pretax
unrealized gains were $16.0 billion, while the pretax
unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds, below
investment grade bonds and equity securities were
$1.6 billion, $599 million and $67 million,
respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect
to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost
relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the market
value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number
of respective items, was as follows:

(a)

For bonds, represents amortized
    cost.

(b)

As more fully described above, upon
    realization, certain realized losses will be charged to
    participating policyholder accounts, or realization will result
    in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred
    acquisition costs.

As stated previously, the valuation for
AIG’s investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or
dealer quotations, with the exception of nontraded securities.
AIG considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income
investments, certain structured securities, direct private
equities, limited partnerships and hedge funds. The aggregate
carrying value of these securities at December 31, 2003 was
approximately $59.9 billion.

The methodology used to estimate fair value of
nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded
securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing
methodology. This technique takes into account such factors as
the industry, the security’s rating and tenor, its coupon
rate, its position in the capital structure of the issuer, and
other relevant factors. The change in fair value is recognized
as a component of unrealized appreciation.

For certain structured securities, the carrying
value is based on an estimate of the security’s future cash
flows pursuant to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and
Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in
Securitized Financial Assets.” The change in carrying value
is recognized in income.

Direct private equities, hedge funds and limited
partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate less than a
five percent interest, are carried at fair value. The change in
fair value is recognized as a component of Other comprehensive
income.

With respect to hedge funds and limited
partnerships in which AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent
or greater interest, AIG’s carrying value is the net asset
value. The changes in such net asset values are recorded in
income.

AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in
limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided
by the sponsors of each of these investments, the accounts of
which are generally audited on an annual basis.

Each of these investment categories is regularly
tested to determine if impairment in value exists. Various
valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in
this determination.

Financial Services Operations

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage
in diversified financial products and services including
aircraft leasing, capital market transactions, and consumer and
insurance premium financing. (See also Note 2 of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

AIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent
the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily
from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic
and foreign airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing
of commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for
financial institutions.

ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily
through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The
composite borrowing rates at December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 were 4.53 percent, 4.73 percent and
5.07 percent, respectively. (See also the discussions under
“Capital Resources” and “Liquidity” herein
and Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity
strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through
owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re-lease at
acceptable rates at lease expiration and, in part, through
committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to
lease.

ILFC manages its lessee nonperformance exposure
through credit reviews and security deposit requirements. As a
result of these measures and its own contingency planning, ILFC
did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the
aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, but there
can be no assurance that ILFC will successfully manage the risks
relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the
airline industry. Over 80 percent of ILFC’s fleet is
leased to non-U.S. carriers, and this fleet, comprised of the
most efficient aircraft in the airline industry, continues to be
in high demand from such carriers.

ILFC typically contracts to re-lease aircraft
before the end of the existing lease term. For aircraft returned
before the end of the lease term, ILFC has generally been able
to re-lease such aircraft within two to six months of its
return. While some of the lease rates for aircraft that have
been redeployed are lower, this is partially offset by low
interest rates, which reduce ILFC’s financing costs. As a
lessor, ILFC considers an aircraft “idle” or “off
lease” when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease
agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had five aircraft off
lease at December 31, 2003 which had been off lease for
less than three months. As of March 8, 2004, all five of
the five unleased aircraft were placed. All new aircraft
deliveries in 2004 have been placed, and 67 percent of 2005
new aircraft deliveries have been leased. (See also the
discussions under “Capital Resources” and
“Liquidity” herein.)

During 2003, ILFC entered into a securitization
of a portfolio of 37 aircraft. Certain of AIG’s Life
Insurance and Retirement Services businesses purchased a large
share of this securitization. A second securitization was
executed in January, 2004.

ILFC management is very active in the airline
industry. Management formally reviews regularly, and no less
frequently than quarterly, issues affecting ILFC’s fleet,
including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of
aircraft values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as
necessary, based on these events and circumstances in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (FAS 144). ILFC has not recognized any impairment
related to its fleet, as the existing service potential of the
aircraft in ILFC’s portfolio has not been diminished.
Further, ILFC has been able to re-lease the aircraft without
diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an
impairment write-down. (See also the discussions under
“Liquidity” herein.)

AIG has integrated the operations of AIGTG into
AIGFP thereby establishing the Capital Markets reporting unit.
AIG believes that this will result in greater efficiencies and
product synergies as well as growth opportunities. Capital
Markets revenues and operating income increases were
attributable primarily to its interest rate linked products. As
Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation, current and
past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for
predicting future performance.

AIG’s Capital Markets operations derive
substantially all their revenues from proprietary positions
entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than
from speculative transactions. These subsidiaries participate in
the derivatives dealer market conducting, primarily as
principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity and
credit derivative products business.

FORM 10-K : 36

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

As dealers, AIGFP and AIGTG mark transactions to
fair value daily. Thus, a gain or loss on each transaction is
recognized daily. AIGFP and AIGTG hedge the market risks arising
from their transactions. Therefore, revenues and operating
income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market
fluctuations and volatility. Revenues of the Capital Markets
operations and the percentage change in revenues for any given
period are significantly affected by the number and size of
transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that
period relative to those entered into during the prior period.
Operating income and the percentage change in operating income
for any period are determined by the number, size and
profitability of the transactions attributable to that period
relative to those attributable to the prior period. Generally,
the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt
of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or
loss on Capital Markets trading transactions are currently
reflected in operating income as the fair values change from
period to period.

Derivative transactions are entered into in the
ordinary course of Capital Markets operations. Therefore, income
on interest rate, equity, commodity and credit derivatives along
with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value
or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily
available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses
reflected in the income statement in the current year. In 2003,
less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions
valued at estimated fair value. The mark to fair value of
derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the
captions “Unrealized gain on interest rate and currency
swaps, options and forward transactions” and
“Unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps,
options and forward transactions”. The unrealized gain
represents the present value of the aggregate of each net
receivable by counterparty, and the unrealized loss represents
the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by
counterparty as of December 31, 2003. These amounts will
change from one period to the next due to changes in interest
rates, currency rates, equity prices and other market variables,
as well as cash movements, execution of new transactions and the
maturing of existing transactions. (See also the discussion
under “Derivatives” herein and Note 21 of Notes
to Financial Statements.) Spread income on investments and
borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the
transaction. Investments are classified as available for sale
securities and are marked to market with the resulting
unrealized gains or losses reflected in shareholders’
equity.

Domestically, AIG’s consumer finance
operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from
finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages, home equity
loans, secured and unsecured consumer loans and retail merchant
financing. Overseas operations provide credit cards, personal
and auto loans, term deposits, savings accounts, sales finance
and mortgages with an emphasis on emerging markets.

Consumer finance operations are exposed to loss
when contractual payments are not received. Collection exposure
is managed through the mix of tight underwriting controls, mix
of loans and collateral thereon.

Financial Services operations for 2003, 2002
and 2001 were as follows:

(a)

Revenues were primarily from ILFC aircraft
    lease rentals.

(b)

Revenues were primarily fees from AIGFP and
    AIGTG proprietary positions entered into in connection with
    counterparty transactions.

(c)

Revenues were primarily finance
    charges.

Financial Services Results

Capital Market activities were the primary reason
for the growth in operating income in 2003 and to a lesser
extent in 2002.

Financial Services operating income represented
17.7 percent of AIG’s consolidated income before
income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of
accounting changes in 2003. This compares to 26.9 percent
and 24.5 percent in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
decrease in contribution percentage was influenced by the impact
that the General Insurance loss reserve charge in 2002 and the
WTC losses in 2001 had on General Insurance operating income and
the reduced contribution of General Insurance operations to
income before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative
effect of accounting changes in those years.

With respect to ILFC, the revenue growth in each
year resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment
under operating lease and the increase in the relative cost of
the leased fleet. The decline in ILFC’s operating income
for 2003 was largely a result of the decline in aircraft
remarketing due to the poor market conditions for secondhand
aircraft. Going forward, AIG believes that ILFC’s
performance will improve as the improvements in the airline
industry are not yet being reflected in ILFC’s results.

FORM 10-K : 37

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

The composition by percentage contribution of
revenues and operating income for Capital Markets in 2003, 2002
and 2001 is set forth below. The percentages for operating
income are the same as those for revenues because expenses are
allocated across all products in proportion to the revenues
generated by that product. Material changes in the distribution
of revenues and operating income from period to period are not
unusual due to the transactional nature of Capital Markets’
business.

Financial market conditions in 2003 compared with
2002 were characterized by lower interest rates across fixed
income markets globally, a tightening of credit spreads, and
higher equity valuations. Capital Markets’ results in 2003
compared with 2002 reflected a shift in product segment activity
to respond to these conditions. In particular, Capital Markets
experienced increases in demand for interest and currency linked
products that addressed the risk management needs of its
counterparties. (See also Note 21 of Notes to Financial
Statements.)

The most significant component of Capital
Markets’ operating expenses is compensation, which
approximated 33 percent, 36 percent and
33 percent of revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Consumer Finance revenues in 2003 increased. The
increase in revenues in 2003 was the result of growth in average
finance receivables and credit quality continues to be strong.
Further, reductions of the cost to borrow led to an improvement
in the operating income over the previous year. The decline in
revenues in 2002 was the result of lower yields on the finance
receivables, but borrowing costs also declined significantly so
that spreads, and therefore operating income, increased as a
result.

Financial Services Invested
Assets

The following table is a summary of the
composition of AIG’s Financial Services invested assets at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. (See also the discussions under
“Operating Review: Financial Services Operations”,
“Capital Resources” and “Derivatives”
herein.)

As previously discussed, the cash used for the
purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the
proceeds of ILFC’s debt financings. The primary sources for
the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are
the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight
equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt.
During 2003, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing
$5.51 billion. (See also the discussion under
“Operating Review: Financial Services Operations” and
“Capital Resources” herein.)

At December 31, 2003, ILFC had committed to
purchase 463 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2004
through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of
$26.2 billion and had options to purchase 11 new
aircraft deliverable from 2004 through 2008 at an estimated
aggregate purchase price of $705 million. As of
March 8, 2004, ILFC has entered into leases for all of the
new aircraft to be delivered in 2004 and 61 of 91 of the new
aircraft to be delivered in 2005 and 30 of 263 of the new
aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2005. ILFC will be
required to find customers for any aircraft presently on order
and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange financing
for portions of the purchase price of such equipment. In a
rising interest rate environment, ILFC negotiates higher lease
rates on any new contracts. ILFC has been successful to date
both in placing its new aircraft on lease or under sales
contract and obtaining adequate financing, but there can be no
assurance that such success will continue in future environments.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

AIG’s Consumer Finance operations provide a
wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and
overseas. Such products include real estate mortgages, consumer
loans, and retail sales finance. These products are funded
through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium
term notes. AIG’s Consumer Finance operations are exposed
to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse
fluctuations in interest rates. Over half of the loan balance is
related to real estate loans which are substantially
collateralized by the related properties.

With respect to credit losses, the allowance for
finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered
adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that
portfolio.

Capital Markets derivative transactions are
carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market
prices are not readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic
risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions
including swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and
futures. The estimated fair values of these transactions
represent assessments of the present value of expected future
cash flows. These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if
AIGFP were required to sell or close out the transactions prior
to maturity. AIG believes that the impact of any such limited
liquidity would not be significant to AIG’s financial
condition or its overall liquidity. (See also the discussion
under “Operating Review: Financial Services
Operations” and “Derivatives” herein.)

AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of
notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified
portfolio of securities, including securities available for
sale, at market, and derivative transactions. The funds may also
be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements
to resell. The proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned
securities available for sale and securities purchased under
agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or
other AIGFP financings. (See also the discussion under
“Capital Resources” herein.)

Securities available for sale is mainly a
portfolio of debt securities, where the individual securities
have varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2003,
the average credit rating of this portfolio was AA or the
equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or
internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative
transactions to hedge its credit risk associated with
$218 million of these securities. Securities deemed below
investment grade at December 31, 2003 amounted to
approximately $98 million in fair value representing 0.6 of
one percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale.
$30 million of this amount is hedged with a credit
derivative. There have been no significant downgrades through
March 1, 2004. Securities purchased under agreements to
resell are treated as collateralized transactions. AIGFP takes
possession of or obtains a security interest in securities
purchased under agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes
its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and,
when AIGFP deems necessary, it requires additional collateral to
be deposited. Trading securities, at market value are marked to
market daily and are held to meet the short-term risk management
objectives of AIGFP.

AIGFP is exposed to credit risk. If its
securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer
significant default and the collateral held declined
significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default
swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a
liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFP’s debt and, as a
result, is responsible for all of AIGFP’s obligations.

AIGTG conducts, as principal, market making and
trading activities in foreign exchange, and commodities,
primarily precious and base metals. AIGTG owns inventories in
the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure
to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and
option contracts. AIGTG uses derivatives to manage the economic
exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from
adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates and commodity prices. AIGTG supports its trading
activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized
losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but
not yet purchased. (See also the discussions under “Capital
Resources” and Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

The gross unrealized gains and gross
unrealized losses of Capital Markets included in the financial
services assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 were
as follows:

(a)

See also Note 8(i) of Notes to Financial
    Statements.

(b)

These amounts are also presented as the
    respective balance sheet amounts.

AIGFP’s interest rate and currency risks on
securities available for sale, at market, are managed by taking
offsetting positions on a security by security basis, thereby
offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation
or depreciation. At December 31, 2003, the unrealized gains
and losses

FORM 10-K : 39

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

remaining after the benefit of the offsets were
$49 million and $67 million, respectively.

Trading securities, at market value, and
securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased, at
market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain
or loss being recognized in income at that time. These
securities are held to meet the short-term risk management
objectives of Capital Markets operations.

The senior management of AIG defines the policies
and establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets
operations. AIG’s senior management has established various
oversight committees to review the various financial market,
operational and credit issues of the Capital Markets operations.
The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its
operations to and reviews future strategies with AIG’s
senior management.

AIG actively manages the exposures to limit
potential losses, while maximizing the rewards afforded by these
business opportunities. In doing so, AIG must continually manage
a variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity,
operational and legal risks.

Retirement Services & Asset Management
Operations

AIG’s Retirement Services & Asset
Management operations offer a wide variety of investment
products, including variable annuities and mutual funds, as well
as investment services, including investment asset management.
Such products and services are offered to individuals and
institutions both domestically and overseas.

Retirement Services & Asset Management
revenues and operating income for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as
follows:

*

Includes AIG Global Investment Group and
    certain foreign fixed and variable annuity operations.

Retirement Services & Asset Management
Results

Retirement Services & Asset Management
operating income

increased in 2003 as
a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and the
improved U.S. economic conditions. The operating income growth
with respect to Retirement Services & Asset Management is
partly contingent upon the growth in the equity markets and
customer interest in equity sensitive products. Thus, as markets
expand and contract, the operating income with respect to this
segment can be expected to be similarly affected.

Retirement Services & Asset Management
operating income represented 9.1 percent of AIG’s
consolidated income before income taxes, minority interest and
cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2003. This compares
to 12.5 percent and 13.4 percent in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

At December 31, 2003, AIG’s third party
assets under management, including both retail mutual funds and
institutional accounts, approximated $46 billion.

With respect to variable annuities, AIG’s
policy has been to adjust amortization assumptions for deferred
acquisition costs (DAC) when estimates of current or future
gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised.
With respect to variable annuities sold domestically
(representing the vast majority of AIG’s variable annuity
business), the assumption for the long-term annual net growth
rate of the equity markets used in the determination of DAC
amortization is approximately 10 percent. A methodology
referred to as “reversion to the mean” is used to
maintain this long-term net growth rate assumption, while giving
consideration to short-term variations in equity markets.

AIG’s variable annuity earnings will be
affected by changes in market returns because separate account
revenues, primarily composed of mortality and expense charges
and asset management fees, are a function of asset values.

A number of guaranteed minimum death benefits
(GMDB) and other similar benefits are offered on variable
annuities. GMDB-related contract benefits incurred, net of
reinsurance, were $72 million, $77 million and
$20 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In
accordance with GAAP, AIG expenses these benefits in the period
paid. Included in the “Accounting Standards” section
is a discussion of new accounting guidance for such benefits.

Other Operations

Other income (deductions)-net includes income
generated by the investment of capital held by AIG SunAmerica
outside of its Life Insurance subsidiaries, AIG’s equity in
certain minor majority-owned subsidiaries and certain partially
owned companies, realized foreign exchange transaction gains and
losses in substantially all currencies and unrealized gains and
losses in hyperinflationary currencies, as well as the income
and expenses of the parent holding company and

FORM 10-K : 40

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

(continued)

other miscellaneous income and expenses. Other
income (deductions)-net amounted to $(464) million,
$(129) million and $3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decline in 2003 was primarily the result of
increases in pension and interest expenses as well as the
capital contribution of certain AIG SunAmerica partnership
investments previously included herein to the Life Insurance and
Retirement Services & Asset Management operations, and
in 2002 weaker performance of AIG SunAmerica investments in
partnerships and 21st Century’s third quarter 2002 pretax
charge of $37 million to write off capitalized costs
associated with a software development project. Acquisition,
restructuring and related charges of $2.02 billion were
incurred in 2001 in connection with the acquisition of AGC,
including $654 million paid by AGC in connection with the
termination of AGC’s merger agreement with Prudential plc.
(See also Note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2003, AIG had total
shareholders’ equity of $71.25 billion and total
borrowings of $77.28 billion. At that date,
$69.63 billion of such borrowings were either not
guaranteed by AIG or were AIGFP’s matched borrowings under
obligations of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs) or
matched notes and bonds payable.

Borrowings

At December 31, 2003, AIG’s
borrowings were $7.7 billion after reflecting amounts not
guaranteed by AIG, amounts that were matched borrowings under
AIGFP’s obligations of GIAs and matched notes and bonds
payable. The following table summarizes borrowings outstanding
at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

Borrowings issued or guaranteed by AIG and
those borrowings not guaranteed by AIG at December 31, 2003
and 2002 were as follows:

(a)

Includes borrowings under Export Credit
    Facility of $1.8 billion.

(b)

Capital lease obligations.

See also Note 9 of Notes to Financial
Statements.

AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of
notes and bonds and GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified
portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. The
borrowings may also be temporarily invested in securities
purchased under agreements to resell. (See also the discussions
under “Operating Review”, “Liquidity” and
“Derivatives” herein and Notes 1, 8,
9 and 21 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

AIG Funding, Inc. (Funding), through the issuance
of commercial paper, helps fulfill the short-term cash
requirements of AIG and its subsidiaries. Funding intends to
continue to meet AIG’s funding requirements through the
issuance of commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. The issuance of
Funding’s commercial paper is subject to the approval of
AIG’s Board of Directors.

FORM 10-K : 41

Subsidiaries

ILFC and AGF as well as AIG Credit Card Company
(Taiwan) – (AIGCCC-Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan)
Limited – (AIGF-Taiwan), both consumer finance
subsidiaries in Taiwan, have issued commercial paper for the
funding of their own operations. At December 31, 2003, AIG
did not guarantee the commercial paper of any of its
subsidiaries other than Funding. (See also the discussion under
“Derivatives” herein and Note 9 of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

AIG and Funding are parties to unsecured
syndicated revolving credit facilities (collectively, the
Facility) aggregating $2.75 billion. The Facility consists
of $1.375 billion in a short-term revolving credit facility
and $1.375 billion in a five year revolving credit
facility. The Facility can be used for general corporate
purposes and also to provide backup for Funding’s
commercial paper programs. There are currently no borrowings
outstanding under the Facility, nor were any borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2003.

AGF is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving
credit facilities aggregating $3.0 billion. The facilities
consist of $1.5 billion in a short-term revolving credit
facility and $1.5 billion in a five year revolving credit
facility, which support AGF’s commercial paper borrowings.
There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor
were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003. In
2003, AGF increased its shelf registration statement by $7.5
billion. AGF had $9.1 billion in aggregate principal amount
of debt securities registered and available for issuance at
December 31, 2003. AGF uses the proceeds from the issuance
of notes and bonds for the funding of its finance receivables.

Proceeds from the collection of finance
receivables will be used to pay the principle and interest with
respect to AGF’s debt.

ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving
credit facilities aggregating $4.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. The facilities are used to support
ILFC’s maturing debt and other obligations and consist of
$3.15 billion in a short-term revolving credit facility and
$1.05 billion in a three year revolving credit facility.
There are currently no borrowings under these facilities, nor
were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2003.

At December 31, 2003, ILFC had increased the
aggregate principal amount outstanding of its medium term and
long-term notes to $20.39 billion, a net increase of
$5.60 billion (of which $697 million results from
foreign exchange translation), and a net decrease in its
commercial paper of $2.64 billion. ILFC had $11.08 billion
of debt securities registered for public sale at
December 31, 2003. During 2003, $6.09 billion of debt
securities were issued. During the second quarter of 2003, ILFC
increased its Euro Medium Term Note Program from
$4.0 billion to $5.0 billion, under which
$3.39 billion in notes were sold through December 31,
2003. ILFC has substantially eliminated the currency exposure
arising from foreign currency denominated notes by either
hedging the notes through swaps or through the offset provided
by operating lease payments. Notes issued under this program are
included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of
borrowings.

ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit
Facility for use in connection with the purchase of
approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility
was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The
interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent
on these borrowings depending on the delivery date of the
aircraft. At December 31, 2003, ILFC had $1.8 billion
outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a
pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title
to the aircraft financed under the facility. During 2003, ILFC
entered into various bank financings for a total funded amount
of $1.3 billion. The financings mature through 2009. One
tranche of one of the loans totaling $410 million was
funded in Japanese yen and swapped to U.S. dollars.
Borrowings with respect to this facility are included in Notes
and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings.

The proceeds of ILFC’s debt financing are
primarily used to purchase flight equipment, including progress
payments during the construction phase. The primary sources for
the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are
the cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight
equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt.
(See also the discussions under “Operating Review” and
“Liquidity” herein.)

AIGFP has established a Euro Medium Term Note
Program under which an aggregate principal amount of up to
$4.0 billion of notes may be outstanding. As of
December 31, 2003, $4.73 billion of notes had been
issued under the program, $3.23 billion of which were
outstanding. Notes issued under this program are included in
Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings.

During 2003, AIG did not issue any medium term
notes, and $207 million of previously issued notes matured
or were redeemed. At December 31, 2003, AIG had
$140 million in aggregate principal amount of debt
securities registered for issuance from time to time. AIG has
filed a universal shelf registration statement to sell up to
$5.1 billion of debt securities, preferred and common stock and
other securities. AIG has no current plans to issue the equity,
equity-linked or capital securities included in the registration
statement, but intends to continue its customary practice of
issuing securities from time to time for general corporate
purposes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

On November 9, 2001, AIG received proceeds
of approximately $1 billion from the issuance of Zero
Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures Due 2031 with an aggregate
principal amount at maturity of approximately
$1.52 billion. Commencing January 1, 2002, the
debentures are convertible into shares of AIG common stock at a
conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
debentures if AIG common stock trades at certain levels for
certain time periods. The debentures are callable by AIG on or
after November 9, 2006. Also, holders can require AIG to
repurchase these debentures once every five years beginning on
November 9, 2006.

As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and
bonds of AGC. During 2002, AGC issued $200 million in notes
which matured in March 2003.

Shareholders’ Equity

AIG’s shareholders’ equity increased
$12.15 billion during 2003. Unrealized appreciation of
investments, net of taxes increased $2.99 billion and the
cumulative translation adjustment loss, net of taxes, decreased
$306 million. The change for 2003 with respect to the
unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes, was
primarily impacted by the decrease in domestic interest rates.
During 2003, there was a gain of $325 million, net of taxes
relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging
instruments. (See also the discussion under “Operating
Review” and “Liquidity” herein, Notes 1(z)
and 8(d) of Notes to Financial Statements and the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.) During 2003,
retained earnings increased $8.69 billion, resulting from
net income less dividends.

Stock Repurchase

During 2003, AIG repurchased in the open market
3,822,500 shares of its common stock. AIG intends to
continue to buy its common shares in the open market for general
corporate purposes, including to satisfy its obligations under
various employee benefit plans.

Dividends from Insurance
Subsidiaries

Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance
subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by
statutory authorities. With respect to AIG’s domestic
insurance subsidiaries, specifically the payment of any dividend
requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the
particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of
many states, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior
approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the
dividend is below certain materiality thresholds. As a result of
these regulations, approximately 71 percent of consolidated
shareholders’ equity was restricted as to immediate payment
by insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent at December 31,
2003.

With respect to AIG’s foreign insurance
subsidiaries, the most significant insurance regulatory
jurisdictions include Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong and the Republic
of China. AIG has in the past reinvested most of its
unrestricted earnings in its operations and believes such
continued reinvestment in the future will be adequate to meet
any foreseeable capital needs. However, AIG may choose from time
to time to raise additional funds through the issuance of
additional securities. At December 31, 2003, there were no
significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair
AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity, but there can be no assurance that such issues will
not arise in the future. To AIG’s knowledge, no AIG company
is on any regulatory or similar “watch list”. (See
also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and
Note 11 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

Regulation and Supervision

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with
other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the
states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has developed
Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. RBC relates an
individual insurance company’s statutory surplus to the
risk inherent in its overall operations. At December 31,
2003, the risk-based adjusted surplus of each of AIG’s
domestic general companies and of each of AIG’s domestic
life companies exceeded each of their RBC standards. Federal,
state or local legislation may affect AIG’s ability to
operate and expand its various financial services businesses and
changes in the current laws, regulations or interpretations
thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses.

AIG’s operations are negatively impacted
under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states.
As a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund
assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for
certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other
insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally
records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain
states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be
used as a credit against a company’s future premium tax
liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot
reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of
credits for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $77 million,
$76 million and $24 million, respectively.

FORM 10-K : 43

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

AIG is also required to participate in various
involuntary pools (principally workers’ compensation
business) which provide insurance coverage for those not able to
obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets. This
participation is also recorded upon notification, as these
amounts cannot reasonably be estimated.

A substantial portion of AIG’s General
Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business
are conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and
supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some
to stringent in others. Generally, AIG, as well as the
underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must

satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses
issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to
modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance
subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business
in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.
AIG’s international operations include operations in
various developing nations. Both current and future foreign
operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political
developments up to and including nationalization of AIG’s
operations without compensation. Adverse effects resulting from
any one country may impact AIG’s results of operations,
liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of
the event and AIG’s net financial exposure at that time in
that country.

Contractual Obligations and

Other Commercial Commitments

The maturity schedule of AIG’s
contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 was as

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

AIG and its subsidiaries do not have any
contractual obligations that are subject to “ratings
triggers” or financial covenants relating to “ratings
triggers” which AIG believes could have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition, future operating results or
liquidity. “Rating triggers” have been defined by one
independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the
outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by
one or more rating agencies. Rating triggers generally relate to
events which (i) could result in the termination or
limitation of credit availability, or require accelerated
repayment, (ii) could result in the termination of business
contracts or (iii) could require a company to post
collateral for the benefit of counterparties.

Special Purpose Vehicles and Off Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

AIG uses special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and off
balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business.
As a result of recent changes in accounting, a number of SPVs
and off balance sheet arrangements have been reflected in
AIG’s consolidated financial statements. In January 2003,
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). FIN46 addressed
the consolidation and disclosure rules for nonoperating entities
that are now defined as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). In
December 2003, FASB issued a revision to Interpretation
No. 46 (FIN46R). In November 2002, FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantors’ Accounting And
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). For
additional information related to AIG’s activities with
respect to VIEs and certain guarantees see “Accounting
Standards” herein and also Notes 1 and 20 of Notes to
Financial Statements. Also, for additional disclosure regarding
AIG’s commercial commitments (including guarantors), see
“Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial
Commitments” herein.

AIG has restrictive guidelines with respect to
the formation of and investment in SPVs and off balance sheet
arrangements.

Liquidity

AIG’s liquidity is primarily derived from
the operating cash flows of its General and Life Insurance
operations.

At December 31, 2003, AIG’s
consolidated invested assets included $9.84 billion of cash
and short-term investments. Consolidated net cash provided from
operating activities in 2003 amounted to $36.16 billion.

Sources of funds considered in meeting the
objectives of AIG’s Financial Services operations include
guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of long-term and
short-term debt, maturities and sales of securities available
for sale, securities sold under repurchase agreements, trading
liabilities, securities and spot commodities sold but not yet
purchased, issuance of equity, and cash provided from such
operations. AIG’s strong capital position and superior
credit ratings are integral to managing this liquidity, as they
enable AIG to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide. (See
also the discussion under “Capital Resources” herein.)

Management believes that AIG’s liquid
assets, its net cash provided by operations, and access to the
capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash
requirements.

The liquidity of the combined insurance
operations is derived both domestically and abroad. The combined
insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources,
underwriting operations and investment operations. In the
aggregate, AIG’s insurance operations generated
approximately $53.3 billion in pretax cash flow during
2003. Cash flow includes periodic premium collections, including
policyholders’ contract deposits, cash flows from
investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance
premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and operating
expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when premiums are
collected and, when as a result of the occurrence of events
specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are paid.
AIG’s insurance investment operations generated
approximately $17.1 billion in investment income cash flow
during 2003. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived
from interest and dividends received and includes realized
capital gains net of realized capital losses. (See also the
discussions under “Operating Review: General Insurance
Operations” and “Life Insurance Operations”
herein.)

With respect to General Insurance operations, if
paid losses accelerated beyond AIG’s ability to fund such
paid losses from current operating cash flows, AIG would need to
liquidate a portion of its General Insurance investment
portfolio and/or arrange for financing. Potential events causing
such a liquidity strain could be the result of several
significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short
period of time. Additional strain on liquidity could occur if
the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a
depressed market place and/or reinsurance recoverable on such
paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such
reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value. (See
also the discussions under “Operating Review: General
Insurance Operations” herein.)

With respect to Life Insurance operations, if a
substantial portion of the Life Insurance operations bond
portfolio diminished significantly in value and/or defaulted,
AIG would need to liquidate other portions of its Life Insurance
investment portfolio and/or arrange financing. Potential events
causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic

FORM 10-K : 45

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

collapse of a nation or region in which AIG Life
Insurance operations exist, nationalization, terrorist acts or
other such economic or political upheaval. (See also the
discussions under “Operating Review: Life Insurance
Operations” herein.)

In addition to the combined insurance pretax
operating cash flow, AIG’s insurance operations held
$8.41 billion in cash and short-term investments at
December 31, 2003. Operating cash flow and the cash and
short-term balances held provided AIG’s insurance
operations with a significant amount of liquidity.

This liquidity is available, among other things,
to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed
income securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity
securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy
loans and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with proceeds
of approximately $122 billion from the maturities, sales
and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of
equity securities was used to purchase approximately
$169 billion of fixed income securities and marketable
equity securities during 2003.

Managing Market Risk

Insurance

AIG’s insurance operations are exposed to
market risk. Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value
resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign
currency exchange rates and equity prices.

Measuring potential losses in fair values is
performed through the application of various statistical
techniques. One such technique is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a
summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and
foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates
the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices
to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined
period of time given a certain probability.

AIG believes that statistical models alone do not
provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market
risk. While VaR models are relatively sophisticated, the
quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the
assumptions and parameters established in creating the related
models. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute
for the experience or judgment of senior management.

AIG has performed a VaR analysis to estimate the
maximum potential loss of fair value for each of AIG’s
insurance segments and for each market risk within each
insurance segment. In this analysis, financial instrument assets
include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real
estate and investment income due and accrued. Financial
instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss
expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, future policy benefits
for life and accident and health insurance contracts and
policyholders’ funds.

Due to the nature of each insurance segment, AIG
manages the General and Life Insurance operations separately. As
a result, AIG manages separately the invested assets of each.
Accordingly, the VaR analysis was separately performed for the
General and the Life Insurance operations.

AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net
fair value of each of AIG’s insurance segments as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002. AIG uses the
historical simulation methodology which entails repricing all
assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates
within a specific historical time period. In this case, the most
recent three years of historical market information for interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used
to construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each
transaction was repriced. Portfolio, business unit and finally
AIG-wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the
values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The final
VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by
these scenarios with 95 percent confidence (i.e., only
5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than
the VaR figure). A one month holding period was assumed in
computing the VaR figure. The significant increases in VaR in
2003 resulted primarily from the higher volatility with respect
to interest rates during 2003 and the increase in the size of
the invested assets portfolios.

The following table presents the VaR on a
combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of
AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002. VaR with respect to combined operations
cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment
amounts presented herein.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

The following table presents the average, high
and low VaRs on a combined basis and of each component of market
risk for each of AIG’s insurance segments as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002.

Financial Services

Market risk arises principally from the
uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential
changes in volatility, interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates, and equity and commodity prices. AIG generally controls
its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions.
AIG’s philosophy with respect to its Capital Markets
operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered
positions that are to be carried. Credit risk exposure is
separately managed. (See the discussion on the management of
credit risk below.)

AIG’s Market Risk Management Department
provides detailed independent review of AIG’s market
exposures, particularly those market exposures of the Capital
Markets operations. This department determines whether
AIG’s market risks, as well as those market risks of
individual subsidiaries, are within the parameters established
by AIG’s senior management. Well established market risk
management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used.
Additionally, this department verifies that specific market
risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by
that subsidiary.

ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of
loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from
adverse fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002, AIG statistically measured the
loss of fair value through the application of a VaR model. In
this analysis, the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations
was determined using the financial instrument assets which
included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue
and the financial instrument liabilities which included the
future servicing of the current debt. The estimated impact of
the current derivative positions was also taken into account.

AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net
fair value of Aircraft Finance operations using the historical
simulation methodology, as previously described. As of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the average
VaR with respect to the net fair value of Aircraft Finance
operations was approximately $38 million and
$20 million, respectively.

Capital Markets operations are exposed to market
risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and
commodity prices. AIGFP and AIGTG hedge their exposure to these
risks primarily through swaps, options, forwards and futures. To
hedge interest rate risks, these subsidiaries may also purchase
U.S. and foreign government obligations.

AIGFP and AIGTG do not seek to manage the market
risk of each transaction through an individual offsetting
transaction. Rather, these subsidiaries take a portfolio
approach to the management of their market risk exposures. AIGFP
and AIGTG value their entire portfolios of market-sensitive
transactions at market value or at estimated fair value when
market values are not readily available. Unrealized gains and
losses, with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income
currently. These valuations represent an assessment of the
present values of expected future cash flows of Capital Markets
transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are
deemed appropriate by AIGFP and AIG’s management.

Estimated fair values are based upon the use of
valuation models. These models utilize, among other things,
market liquidity and current interest, foreign exchange, equity,
commodity and volatility rates. These valuation models are
integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio, as described
above, in order to provide timely information for the market

FORM 10-K : 47

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

risk management of the portfolio. Based upon this
evaluation, AIGFP and AIGTG determines what, if any, offsetting
transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of
the portfolio.

AIGFP and AIGTG manage market risk with a variety
of transactions, including swaps, trading securities, futures
and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate. The
recorded values of these transactions may be different than the
values that might be realized if these subsidiaries were
required to sell or close out the transactions prior to
maturity. AIG believes that such differences are not significant
to the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Such differences would be immediately recognized when the
transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity.

AIGFP and AIGTG attempt to secure reliable and
independent current market prices, such as published exchange
prices, external subscription services such as from Bloomberg or
Reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model. When
such prices are not available, these subsidiaries use an
internal methodology which includes interpolation or
extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to
the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have
not materially deviated from these models.

Systems used by Capital Markets operations can
monitor each unit’s respective market positions on an
intraday basis. The subsidiaries operate in major business
centers overseas and are essentially open for business
24 hours a day. Thus, the market exposure and offset
strategies are monitored, reviewed and coordinated around the
clock.

AIGFP and AIGTG apply various testing techniques
which reflect significant potential market movements in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices,
volatility levels and the effect of time. These techniques vary
by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors
affecting the derivatives portfolio. The results from these
analyses are regularly reviewed by senior management.

As described above, Capital Markets operations
are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse
fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange
rates and equity and commodity prices. AIG statistically
measured the losses of fair value through the application of a
VaR model across both units.

Capital Markets asset and liability portfolios
for which the VaR analyses were performed included over the
counter and exchange traded investments, derivative instruments
and commodities. Because the market risk with respect to
securities available for sale, at market is substantially
hedged, segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading
and other than trading was not deemed necessary.

AIG calculated the VaR with respect to Capital
Markets operations as of December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002. AIG uses the historical simulation
methodology which entails repricing all assets and liabilities
under explicit changes in market rates within a specific
historical time period. In this case, the most recent three
years of historical market information for interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices were used to
construct the historical scenarios. For each scenario, each
transaction was repriced. Portfolio, business unit and finally
AIG-wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the
values of all the underlying assets and liabilities. The final
VaR number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by
these scenarios with 95 percent confidence (i.e., only
5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than
the VaR figure). A one-month holding period was assumed in
computing the VaR figure.

The following table presents the VaR on a
combined basis and of each component of Capital Markets risk as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002. VaR with respect to combined
operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk
presented herein.

The following table presents the average, high
and low VaRs on a combined basis and of each component of
Capital Markets risk as of December 31, 2003 and
2002.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial arrangements among two
or more parties. The returns of the derivatives are linked to or
“derived” from some underlying equity, debt, commodity
or other asset, liability, or index. Derivatives payments may be
based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of
certain securities, certain commodities, or financial or
commodity indices. The more significant types of derivative
arrangements in which AIG transacts are swaps, forwards, futures
and options. In the normal course of business, with the
agreement of the original counterparty, these contracts may be
terminated early or assigned to another counter-party.

FORM 10-K : 48

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

(continued)

The overwhelming majority of AIG’s
derivatives activities are conducted by the Capital Markets
operations, thus permitting AIG to participate in the
derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal. In
these derivative operations, AIG structures agreements which
generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions
with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates,
securities’ prices and certain commodities and financial or
commodity indices. AIG’s customers such as corporations,
financial institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign
entities, government agencies and municipalities use derivatives
to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a futures,
forward or option contract can be used to protect the
customers’ assets or liabilities against price fluctuations.

A counterparty may default on any obligation to
AIG, including a derivative contract. Credit risk is a
consequence of extending credit and/or carrying trading and
investment positions. Credit risk exists for a derivative
contract when that contract has a positive fair value to AIG. To
help manage this risk, the credit departments of AIGFP and AIGTG
operate within the guidelines set by the AIG Credit Risk
Committee. This committee establishes the credit policy, sets
limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative
transactions with counterparties having different credit
ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this committee takes
into account other factors, including the industry and country
of the counterparty. Transactions which fall outside these
pre-established guidelines require the approval of the AIG
Credit Risk Committee. It is also AIG’s policy to establish
reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary.

AIG’s Derivatives Review Committee provides
an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction.
The committee examines, among other things, the nature and
purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit
exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits. This committee
does not review those derivative transactions entered into by
Capital Markets for their own accounts.

Generally, AIG conducts its businesses in the
currencies of the local operating environment. Thus, exchange
gains or losses occur when AIG’s foreign currency net
investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates
relative to the U.S. dollar from one reporting period to the
next.

Legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the
enforceability, through legal or judicial processes, of the
obligations of AIG’s clients and counterparties, including
contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by
providing for the netting of mutual obligations. See also
Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements for detailed
information relating to Capital Markets derivative activities.

Accounting Standards

In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires
that, for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended
after December 31, 2002, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be
established, and recognized through earnings. To date, the
impact on earnings for AIG has not been and is not expected to
be material.

AIG guarantees the indebtedness of third parties
principally in connection with AIG SunAmerica’s investments
in affordable housing properties. The guarantees are issued
primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the
underlying properties, and have durations of up to ten years.
Since the inception of this investment program over ten years
ago, payments under these guarantees have been insignificant
because the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of
the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by
the underlying properties. The maximum exposure before
consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees
as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $2.4 billion.

In addition, AIG’s real estate investment
operations will occasionally extend guarantees to real estate
partnerships in which they are an investor. The guarantees
facilitate financing for the construction and/or purchase of
land. There have been no payments to date under these guarantees
as the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the
third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the
underlying properties. The maximum exposure before consideration
of the applicable security under these guarantees as of
December 31, 2003 is approximately $112 million.

Through ILFC, AIG has also provided other types
of guarantees. From time to time, ILFC participates with
airlines, banks and other financial institutions to assist in
financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees, put options or
loan guarantees. Historically, losses arising from these
guarantees have not been material, as ILFC has recourse to the
value of the underlying aircraft, which offsets ILFC’s
exposure, should ILFC be called upon to fulfill its obligations
under these guarantees. The maximum exposure related to these
guarantees as of December 31, 2003, before consideration of
the applicable security, is approximately $897 million.

FORM 10-K : 49

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (FIN 46). FIN 46 changes the method of
determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in
AIG’s consolidated financial statements. An entity is
subject to FIN 46 and is called a Variable Interest Entity
(VIE) if it has

(i)

equity that is insufficient to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties, or

(ii)

equity investors that cannot make significant
decisions about the entity’s operations, or that do not
absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of
the entity. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary,
which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or
a majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both.
All other entities not considered VIEs are evaluated for
consolidation under existing guidance. In December 2003, FASB
issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46R).

The provisions of FIN46R are to be applied
immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to
VIEs in which AIG obtains an interest after that date. For VIEs
in which AIG holds a variable interest that it acquired before
February 1, 2003, FIN46R was applied as of
December 31, 2003. For any VIEs that must be consolidated
under FIN 46R that were created before February 1,
2003, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the
VIEs would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with
any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet
and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change. In accordance with
the transition provisions of FIN 46R, AIG recorded in its
consolidated income statement for the fourth quarter of 2003 a
cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of
$9 million ($14 million before tax). In addition, AIG
recorded in its consolidated balance sheet approximately
$4.7 billion of assets and liabilities. (See also
Note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.)

In May 2003, FASB issued Financial Accounting
Standard No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity” (FAS 150). FAS 150 requires certain financial
instruments previously classified as either entirely equity or
between the liabilities section and the equity section of the
balance sheet be classified as liabilities.

FAS 150 requires issuers to classify as
liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial
instruments: mandatory redeemable financial instruments;
obligations to repurchase the issuer’s equity shares by
transferring assets; and certain obligations to issue a variable
number of shares.

FAS 150 was effective for the quarter ending
September 30, 2003. As of December 31, 2003,
$1.68 billion of preferred instruments previously
classified on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as
“Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies” is now classified in the liability caption
entitled “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies subject to mandatory redemption.” Restatement of
financial statements for prior periods is not permitted.

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1,
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for
Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
Accounts” (SOP 03-1). This statement is effective as
of January 1, 2004, and will require AIG to recognize a
liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits and other living
benefits related to its variable annuity and variable life
contracts and to modify certain disclosures and financial
statement presentations for these products. In the first quarter
of 2004, AIG will report a one-time cumulative accounting charge
upon adoption of $181 million ($278 million pretax to
reflect the liability as of January 1, 2004). With respect
to the balance sheet presentation, the non-U.S. portion of
AIG’s separate and variable account assets and liabilities
will be reclassified to several invested asset captions and the
policyholders’ contract deposits liability caption,
respectively.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
American International Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the

generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Principles of
Consolidation:

On August 29,
2001 American General Corporation (AGC), was acquired by
American International Group, Inc. (AIG). In connection with the
acquisition, AIG issued approximately 290 million shares of
its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common
stock of AGC based on an exchange ratio of 0.5790 of a share of
AIG common stock for each share of AGC common stock. The
acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and the
accompanying financial statements have been prepared to
retroactively combine AGC’s financial statements with
AIG’s financial statements for all periods presented.

All of the share information included herein
reflects the application of the exchange ratio to the number of
shares of AGC common stock outstanding at the relevant times
rather than the number of shares of AIG common stock actually
issued or outstanding at such times. In addition, AGC
convertible preferred stock has been included based on its AGC
common stock equivalent in the restated capital accounts.

AIG subsidiaries write property, casualty,
marine, life and financial lines insurance in approximately 130
countries and jurisdictions. Certain of AIG’s foreign
subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements
report on a fiscal year ending November 30. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG,
its majority owned subsidiaries and those entities required to
be consolidated under applicable accounting standards. (See also
Note 1(bb) herein). All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

(b) Basis of
Presentation:

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared on the basis of U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Certain accounts have been reclassified in the
2002 and 2001 financial statements to conform to their 2003
presentation.

General Insurance Operations:

AIG’s General Insurance
subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially
all lines of property and casualty insurance. Premiums are
earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the
related coverage. The reserve for unearned premiums represents
the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms
of coverage.

Acquisition costs represent those costs,
including commissions, that vary with and are primarily related
to the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and
amortized over the period in which the related premiums written
are earned. The deferred acquisition cost (DAC) asset is
reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the
underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is not
anticipated in the deferral of acquisition costs.

Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as
incurred. The reserve for losses and loss expenses represents
the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and includes
provisions for losses incurred but not reported. The methods of
determining such estimates and establishing resulting reserves,
including amounts relating to reserves for estimated
unrecoverable reinsurance, are reviewed and updated. Adjustments
resulting therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG
discounts certain of its loss reserves primarily related to
workers’ compensation and other business lines where
permitted by regulatory authorities. The total amount of
discount is less than three percent of outstanding loss reserves
as reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

Life Insurance Operations:

AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries
offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and
investment products. Traditional products consist of individual
and group life, annuity, endowment and accident and health
policies. Financial and investment products consist of single
premium annuity, guaranteed investment contracts, universal life
and pensions.

Premiums for traditional life insurance products
and life contingent annuities, excluding accident and health
products, are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for
premiums due but not yet collected are accrued. Benefits and
expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits
over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal
life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for
the cost of insurance, administration and surrenders during the
period. Policy charges collected with respect to future services
are deferred and recognized in a manner similar to the deferred
policy acquisition costs related to such products. Expenses
include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit
payments made in excess of policy account balances. Personal
accident products are accounted for in a manner similar to
general insurance products described above. Certain foreign
jurisdictions have limited long-dated bond markets and AIG may
use alternative investments, including equities and foreign
denominated fixed income instruments, to extend the effective
duration of the investment portfolio to more closely match that
of the policyholders’ liabilities.

Policy acquisition costs for traditional life
insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the
premium paying period of the policy. Policy acquisition costs

FORM 10-K : 60

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(continued)

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

and policy initiation costs related to universal
life and investment-type products (nontraditional products) are
deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the
incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the
estimated lives of the contracts. Estimated gross profits are
composed of net interest income, net realized investment gains
and losses, variable annuity fees, surrender charges and direct
administrative expenses.

The resulting DAC asset is reviewed for
recoverability based on the profitability (both current and
projected future) of the underlying insurance contracts.

The deferred acquisition costs with respect to
nontraditional products are adjusted with respect to estimated
gross profits as a result of changes in the net unrealized gains
or losses on debt and equity securities available for sale. That
is, as debt and equity securities available for sale are carried
at aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred
policy acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization
that would have been recorded if such securities had been sold
at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested
at current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is
included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt
and equity securities available for sale that is credited or
charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy
acquisition costs have been decreased by $2.05 billion at
December 31, 2003 and decreased by $1.23 billion at
December 31, 2002 for this adjustment. (See also
Note 4 herein.)

The liabilities for future policy benefits and
policyholders’ contract deposits are established using
assumptions described in Note 6.

Financial Services Operations:

AIG participates in the derivatives
dealer market conducting, primarily as principal, an interest
rate, currency, equity, commodity and credit derivative products
business. AIG also enters into structured transactions,
including long-dated forward foreign exchange contracts, option
transactions, liquidity facilities and investment agreements,
and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities.

AIG engages in market making and trading
activities, as principal, in foreign exchange, interest rates
and precious and base metals. AIG owns inventories in the
commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to
market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures and
option contracts.

AIG, as lessor, leases flight equipment
principally under operating leases. Accordingly, income is
recognized over the life of the lease as rentals become
receivable under the provisions of the lease or, in the case of
leases with varying payments, under the straight-line method
over the noncancelable term of the lease. In certain cases,
leases provide for additional payments contingent on usage.
Rental income is recognized at the time such usage occurs less a
provision for future contractual aircraft maintenance. AIG is
also a remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and
for airlines and financial institutions, and provides, for a
fee, fleet management services to certain third-party operators.
AIG’s revenues from such operations consist of net gains on
sales of flight equipment and commissions.

AIG provides a wide variety of consumer finance
products, including mortgages, personal and auto loans, retail
sales finance and credit related insurance.

Finance charges are recognized as revenue using
the interest method. Revenue ceases to be accrued when
contractual payments are not received for four consecutive
months for loans and retail sales contracts, and for six months
for revolving retail accounts and private label receivables.
Extension fees, late charges, and prepayment penalties are
recognized as revenue when received.

Direct costs of originating loans, net of
nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the
carrying amount of the related loans. The amount deferred is
recognized as an adjustment to finance charge revenues, using
the interest method over the lesser of the contractual term or
the expected life based on prepayment experience. If loans are
prepaid, any remaining deferral is charged or credited to
revenue.

Foreclosure proceedings are initiated on real
estate loans when four monthly installments are past due and
these loans are charged off at foreclosure. All other finance
receivables are charged off when minimal or no collections have
been made for six months.

The allowance for finance receivable losses is
maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated
credit losses in the existing portfolio. The portfolio is
periodically evaluated on a pooled basis and considers factors
such as economic conditions, portfolio composition, and loss and
delinquency experience in the evaluation of the allowance.

Retirement Services & Asset
Management Operations:

AIG’s
Retirement Services & Asset Management operations offer a
wide variety of investment vehicles and services, including
variable annuities, mutual funds and investment asset
management. Such products and services are offered to
individuals and institutions both domestically and
internationally. The fees generated with respect to Retirement
Services & Asset Management operations are recognized
as revenues when earned. Costs incurred in the sale of variable
annuities and mutual funds are deferred and subsequently
amortized. With respect to variable annuities, acquisition costs
are amortized in relation to the incidence of estimated gross
profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the variable
annuity

FORM 10-K : 61

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

contracts. With respect to the sale of mutual
funds, acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives
of the funds obtained.

(c) NonCash Transactions:

During 2001, AIG issued
291.6 million common shares in connection with acquisitions.

(d) Investments in Fixed Maturities
and Equity Securities:

Bonds held
to maturity are principally owned by the insurance subsidiaries
and are carried at amortized cost where AIG has the ability and
positive intent to hold these securities until maturity.

Where AIG may not have the positive intent to
hold bonds and preferred stocks until maturity, these securities
are considered to be available for sale and carried at current
market values. Interest income with respect to fixed maturity
securities is accrued currently.

Included in the bonds available for sale are
collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Premiums and
discounts arising from the purchase of CMOs are treated as yield
adjustments over their estimated lives.

Bond trading securities are carried at current
market values, as it is AIG’s intention to sell these
securities in the near term.

Common and nonredeemable preferred stocks are
carried at current market values. Dividend income is generally
recognized when receivable.

Unrealized gains and losses from investments in
equity securities and fixed maturities available for sale are
reflected as a separate component of comprehensive income, net
of deferred income taxes in shareholders’ equity currently.
Unrealized gains and losses from investments in trading
securities are reflected in income currently.

Realized capital gains and losses are determined
principally by specific identification. Where declines in values
of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be
other than temporary, a charge is reflected in income for the
difference between cost or amortized cost and estimated net fair
value.

AIG regularly reviews its investments for
possible impairment based on criteria including economic
conditions, market prices, past experience and other
issuer-specific developments among other factors. If there is a
decline in a security’s net realizable value, a
determination is made as towhether that decline is temporary or
“other-than temporary”. If it is believed that a
decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary,
the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated
other comprehensive income. If it is believed that the decline
is “other-than temporary”, AIG writes down the
carrying value of the investment and records a realized loss in
the statement of income.

In January 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) issued EITF 99-20, “Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained
Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets.”
EITF 99-20 provides guidance on the calculation of interest
income and the recognition of impairments related to beneficial
interests held in an investment portfolio. Beneficial interests
are investments that represent rights to receive specified cash
flows from a pool of underlying assets (e.g., collateralized
debt obligations). In accordance with the transition provisions
of EITF 99-20, AIG recorded in its consolidated income
statement for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change
adjustment loss of $130 million ($200 million before
tax).

(e) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate,
Policy and Collateral Loans –
net:

Mortgage loans on real
estate, policy loans and collateral loans are carried at unpaid
principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued
currently.

Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and
collateral loans is based upon certain risk factors and when
collection of all amounts due under the contractual term is not
probable. This impairment is generally measured based on the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
loan’s effective interest rate subject to the fair value of
underlying collateral. Interest income on such loans is
recognized as cash is received.

There is no allowance for policy loans, as these
loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death
claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by
the cash surrender value of the policy.

(f) Flight Equipment:

Flight equipment is stated at
cost. Major additions and modifications are capitalized. Normal
maintenance and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and
compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease
are provided by and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions
of most leases for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the
lessee is reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding
contingent rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a
charge to income for such reimbursements based upon the expected
reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and
amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a
residual value of approximately 15 percent over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding
25 years. AIG monitors the global aircraft market and the
values of various types and models of aircraft

FORM 10-K : 62

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

within that market relative to the values of its
own fleet. If events or circumstances were such that the
carrying amount of AIG’s aircraft might be impaired, AIG
would determine if such impairment existed and recognize such
impairment in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.

This caption also includes deposits for aircraft
to be purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed
of, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and
amortization are removed from the related accounts and the
difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss.

(g) Securities Available for Sale, at
market value:

These securities are
held to meet long term investment objectives and are accounted
for as available for sale, carried at current market values and
recorded on a trade date basis. Unrealized gains and losses from
valuing these securities and any related hedges are reflected in
shareholders’ equity currently, net of any related deferred
income taxes. When the underlying security is sold, the realized
gain or loss resulting from the hedging derivative transaction
is recognized in income in that same period as the realized gain
or loss of the hedged security.

(h) Trading Securities, at market
value:

Trading securities are held
to meet short term investment objectives, including hedging
securities. These securities are recorded on a trade date basis
and carried at current market values. Unrealized gains and
losses are reflected in income currently.

(i) Spot Commodities, at market value:

Spot commodities are carried at
current market values and are recorded on a trade date basis.
The exposure to market risk may be reduced through the use of
forwards, futures and option contracts. Unrealized gains and
losses of both commodities and any derivative transactions are
reflected in income currently.

(j) Unrealized Gain and Unrealized
Loss on Interest Rate and Currency Swaps, Options and Forward
Transactions:

Interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, equity swaps, swaptions, options and forward
transactions are accounted for as contractual commitments
recorded on a trade date basis and are carried at current market
values or estimated fair values when market values are not
available. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income
currently. Estimated fair values are based on the use of
valuation models that utilize, among other things, current
interest, foreign exchange and volatility rates. AIG attempts to
secure reliable and independent current market prices, such as
published exchange prices, external subscription services’
prices such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third party broker quotes
for use in these models. When such prices are not available, AIG
uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or
extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to
the dates of the transactions. These valuations represent an
assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows
of these transactions and reflect market and credit risk. The
portfolio’s discounted cash flows are evaluated with
reference to current market conditions, maturities within the
portfolio and other relevant factors. Based upon this
evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if
any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio.
AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions,
including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward
contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the
limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded
values of these transactions may be different than the values
that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the
transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such
differences are not significant to the results of operations,
financial condition or liquidity. Such differences would be
immediately recognized in income when the transactions are sold
or closed out prior to maturity.

(k) Trading Assets and Trading
Liabilities:

Trading assets and
trading liabilities include option premiums paid and received
and receivables from and payables to counterparties which relate
to unrealized gains and losses on futures, forwards and options
and balances due from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges.

Futures, forwards and options purchased and
written are accounted for as contractual commitments on a trade
date basis and are carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and
losses are reflected in income currently. The fair values of
futures contracts are based on closing exchange quotations.
Commodity forward transactions are carried at fair values
derived from dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange
quotations. For long dated forward transactions, where there are
no dealer or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using
internally developed valuation methodologies based on observable
and available market information. Options are carried at fair
values based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among
other things, current interest or commodity rates and foreign
exchange and volatility rates, as applicable.

(l) Securities Purchased (Sold) Under
Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract value:

Purchases of securities under
agreements to resell and sales of securities under agreements to
repurchase are accounted for as collateralized lending
transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or
repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. Generally, it is
AIG’s policy to take possession of or obtain a security
interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell.

FORM 10-K : 63

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties
to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual
obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and
collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral
to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary.

AIG also enters into dollar roll agreements.
These are agreements to sell mortgage-backed securities and to
repurchase substantially the same securities at a specified
price and date in the future. At December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, there were no dollar rolls outstanding.

(m) Finance Receivables:

Finance receivables are carried at
amortized cost, net of an allowance.

(n) Securities Lending Collateral and
Securities Lending Payable:

AIG’s insurance operations
lend their securities and primarily take cash as collateral with
respect to the securities lent. Income earned on invested
collateral, net of interest payable to the collateral provider
is recorded in net investment income.

(o) Other Invested Assets:

Other invested assets consist
primarily of investments by AIG’s insurance operations in
joint ventures and partnerships, and other investments not
classified elsewhere herein.

The joint ventures and partnerships are carried
at equity or cost depending on the equity ownership position.

Other investments are carried at cost or market
values depending upon the nature of the underlying assets.

(p) Reinsurance Assets:

Reinsurance assets include the
balances due from both reinsurance and insurance companies under
the terms of AIG’s reinsurance agreements for paid and
unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and
ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health
insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts
related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect
to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized.

(q) Investments in Partially Owned
Companies:

Generally, the equity
method of accounting is used for AIG’s investment in
companies in which AIG’s ownership interest approximates
20 percent but is not greater than 50 percent
(minority owned companies). At December 31, 2003,
AIG’s significant investments in partially owned companies
included its 24.3 percent interest in IPC Holdings,
Ltd., its 23.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance
Holdings, Ltd. and its 22.1 percent interest in The Fuji
Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. This balance sheet caption
also includes investments in less significant partially owned
companies and in certain minor majority owned subsidiaries. The
amounts of dividends received from unconsolidated entities owned
less than 50 percent were $13 million,
$13 million and $3 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The undistributed earnings of unconsolidated
entities owned less than 50 percent was $283 million
and $155 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(r) Real Estate and Other Fixed
Assets:

The costs of buildings and
furniture and equipment are depreciated principally on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum
of 40 years for buildings and 10 years for furniture
and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to income as incurred; expenditures for betterments are
capitalized and depreciated.

From time to time, AIG assesses the carrying
value of its real estate relative to the market values of real
estate within the specific local area.

(s) Separate and Variable Accounts:

Separate and variable accounts
represent funds for which investment income and investment gains
and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who
predominantly bear the investment risk. Each account has
specific investment objectives, and the assets are carried at
market value. The assets of each account are legally segregated
and are not subject to claims which arise out of any other
business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are equal to
the account assets.

(t) Securities and Spot Commodities
Sold but not yet Purchased, at market value:

Securities and spot commodities
sold but not yet purchased represent sales of securities and
spot commodities not owned at the time of sale. The obligations
arising from such transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis and carried at the respective current market values or
current commodity prices. Unrealized gains or losses are
reflected in income currently.

(u) Preferred Shareholders’
Equity in Subsidiary Companies Subject to Mandatory Redemption:

Preferred shareholders’
equity in subsidiary companies subject to mandatory redemption
relates to outstanding preferred stock or interest of AGC and
HSB, both wholly owned subsidiaries of AIG. Cash distributions
on such preferred stock or interest are accounted for as
interest expense.

(v) Preferred Shareholders’
Equity in Subsidiary Companies:

Preferred shareholders’
equity in subsidiary companies relates to outstanding preferred
stock or interest of ILFC and AIG Edison Life, both wholly owned
subsidiaries of AIG. Cash distributions on such preferred stock
or interest are accounted for as interest expense.

(w) Translation of Foreign Currencies:

Financial statement accounts
expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”
(FAS 52). Under FAS 52, functional currency assets and

FORM 10-K : 64

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(continued)

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective
subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded
as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of any
related taxes in shareholders’ equity. Functional
currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating
environment. Income statement accounts expressed in functional
currencies are translated using average exchange rates. The
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements
of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies
are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from
foreign currency transactions are also recorded in income
currently. The exchange gain or loss with respect to utilization
of foreign exchange hedging instruments is recorded as a
component of comprehensive income.

(x) Income Taxes:

Deferred federal and foreign
income taxes are provided for temporary differences for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in AIG’s financial statements or tax returns.

(y) Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per common share
are based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock
dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings per share are based
on those shares used in basic earnings per share plus shares
that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common
shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding,
retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock
splits.

The computation of earnings per share for
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was as follows:

*

Certain shares arising from employee stock
    plans were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
    per share where the exercise price of the options exceeded the
    average market price and would have been antidilutive. The
    number of shares excluded were 26 million, 9 million
    and 3 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
    respectively.

(z) Derivatives:

In June 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 133. In June 2000,
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 138 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities – an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133.” In April 2003, FASB issued Statement of
Financial Standards No. 149 “An Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” (collectively, FAS 133).

FAS 133 requires AIG to recognize all derivatives
in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial
statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a
derivative depends on a number of factors, including the
intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is
effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair
value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP and AIG Trading
Group Inc. and its subsidiaries (AIGTG) are currently presented,
in all material respects, as a component of AIG’s operating
income. The discussion below relates to the derivative
activities of AIG other than those of AIGFP and AIGTG.

FORM 10-K : 65

American International Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

On the date the derivative contract is entered
into, AIG designates the derivative as:

(i)

a hedge
of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized
asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment
(“fair value” hedge);

(ii)

a hedge of a
forecasted transaction, or the variability of cash flows to be
received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
(“cash flow” hedge); or

(iii)

a hedge of a
net investment in a foreign operation. Fair value and cash flow
hedges may involve foreign currencies (“foreign currency
hedges”). The gain or loss in the fair value of a
derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective
as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings,
along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a
derivative that is designated, qualifies and is highly effective
as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income,
until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows.
The gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is
designated, qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a
net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign
currency translation adjustments account within other
comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in
current period earnings.

AIG documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that
are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet, or specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions. AIG also assesses, both at the hedge’s
inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used
in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.

In accordance with the transition provisions of
FAS 133, AIG recorded in its consolidated income statement
for 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment
loss of $6 million. This loss represents the net fair value
of all previous unrecorded derivative instruments as of
January 1, 2001, net of tax and after the application of
hedge accounting. AIG also recorded in its consolidated
statement of comprehensive income for 2001 a cumulative effect
of an accounting change adjustment gain of $150 million.
This gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income,
net of taxes, arising from recognizing the fair value of all
derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging
instruments, and to a lesser extent, hedging instruments used to
hedge net investments in foreign operations.

In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses
derivative instruments with respect to investment operations,
which include, among other things, writing option contracts, and
purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity
linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market
value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG
bifurcates an embedded derivative where:

(i)

the
economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not
clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components
of the financial instrument; and

(ii)

a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument meets
the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. (See also
Note 21 herein).

(aa) Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

In June 2001, FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141
“Business Combinations” (FAS 141). FAS 141
requires AIG, among other things, to apply the purchase method
of accounting for all acquisitions initiated after June 30,
2001.

In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (FAS 142). As of
January 1, 2002, AIG adopted FAS 142. FAS 142
requires AIG to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its
consolidated income statement. Amortization expense recorded in
AIG’s consolidated statement of income amounted to
$163 million pretax for 2001.

FAS 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an
assessment of impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently
if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has
occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step
process prescribed in FAS 142, whereby an initial
assessment for potential impairment is performed, followed by a
measurement of the amount of impairment, if any. FAS 142
also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test
in the year of adoption, with any identified impairments
recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principles. AIG completed its transitional impairment test for
2002 and its annual test for 2003, resulting in no impairment.

On August 29, 2003, AIG acquired 100 percent
of the outstanding common shares of GE Edison Life Insurance
Company in Japan and GE’s U.S. based auto and home
insurance business for $2.1 billion. The acquisition
expands AIG’s life insurance presence in Japan and
AIG’s auto and home insurance presence in the U.S. At the
date of acquisition, the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were $20 billion and $19 billion,
respectively. Goodwill associated with this transaction as of
December 31, 2003 amounted to $1.3 billion, primarily
related to the life business.

Other changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation
adjustments.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

(continued)

(bb) Accounting Standards:

In November 2002, FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45).
FIN 45 requires that, for guarantees within its scope that
are issued or amended after December 31, 2002, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee be established and recognized through earnings. To
date, the impact on earnings for AIG has not been and is not
expected to be material.

AIG guarantees the indebtedness of third parties
principally in connection with AIG SunAmerica’s investments
in affordable housing properties. The guarantees are issued
primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the
underlying properties, and have durations of up to ten years.
Since the inception of this investment program over ten years
ago, payments under these guarantees have been insignificant
because the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of
the third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by
the underlying properties. The maximum exposure before
consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees
as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $2.4 billion.

In addition, AIG’s real estate investment
operations will occasionally extend guarantees to real estate
partnerships in which they are an investor. The guarantees
facilitate financing for the construction and/or purchase of
land. There have been no payments to date under these guarantees
as the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the
third party general partner, and secondly, are secured by the
underlying properties. The maximum exposure before consideration
of the applicable security of these guarantees as of
December 31, 2003 is approximately $112 million.

Through ILFC, AIG has also provided other types
of guarantees. From time to time, ILFC participates with
airlines, banks and other financial institutions to assist in
financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees, put options or
loan guarantees. Historically, losses arising from these
guarantees have not been material, as ILFC has recourse to the
value of the underlying aircraft, which offsets ILFC’s
exposure, should ILFC be called upon to fulfill its obligations
under these guarantees. The maximum exposure related to these
guarantees as of December 31, 2003, before consideration of
the applicable security, is approximately $897 million.

In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (FIN46). (See also Note 20 of Notes to
Financial Statements.)

In May 2003, FASB issued Financial Accounting
Standard No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity” (FAS 150). FAS 150 requires certain
financial instruments previously classified as either entirely
equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section
of the balance sheet to be classified as liabilities. FAS 150
requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three
types of freestanding financial instruments: mandatory
redeemable financial instruments; obligations to repurchase the
issuer’s equity shares by transferring assets; and certain
obligations to issue a variable number of shares.

FAS 150 was effective for the quarter ending
September 30, 2003. As of December 31, 2003,
$1.68 billion of preferred instruments previously
classified on AIG’s consolidated balance sheet as
“Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies” is now classified in the liability caption
entitled “Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies subject to mandatory redemption.” Restatement of
financial statements for prior periods is not permitted.

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1,
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for
Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
Accounts” (SOP 03-1). FASB did not object to the
issuance of SOP 03-1. This statement is effective as of
January 1, 2004, and will require AIG to recognize a
liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits and other living
benefits related to its variable annuity and variable life
contracts and to modify certain disclosures and financial
statement presentations for these products. In the first quarter
of 2004, AIG will report a one-time cumulative accounting charge
upon adoption of $181 million ($278 million pretax to reflect
the liability as of January 1, 2004). With respect to the
balance sheet presentation, the non-U.S. portion of AIG’s
separate and variable account assets and liabilities will be
reclassified to several invested asset captions and the
policyholders’ contract deposits liability caption,
respectively.

In December 2003, FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (Revised)
“Employers’ Disclosures About Pensions and Other Post
Retirement Benefits” which revised disclosure requirements
with respect to defined benefit plans. (See also Note 15
herein.)

3. Federal Income Taxes

(a) AIG and its eligible domestic
subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return.
Each of the AGC group of life insurance companies and the AIG
SunAmerica group of life insurance companies also file a
consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. Commencing with
taxable year 2004, the AIG SunAmerica group of life insurance
companies will be included in AIG’s consolidated tax return.

Revenue Agent’s Reports proposing to assess
additional taxes for the years 1991-1996 and 1997-1999 have been
issued to AIG. Letters of Protest contesting the proposed
assessments for 1991-1996 have been filed with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). A Letter of Protest is also being filed
for 1997-1999. AIG has also filed a petition with the Tax Court
for tax year 1990 regarding a transitional rule in the Internal
Revenue Code. In addition, Revenue Agent’s Reports
proposing to assess additional taxes for the years ended
September 30, 1993-1994 and 1995-1996 have been issued to
AIG SunAmerica. Such proposed assessments relate to years prior
to AIG’s acquisition of SunAmerica, Inc. Letters of Protest
contesting the proposed assessments have been filed with the
IRS. It is management’s belief that there are substantial
arguments in support of the positions taken by AIG and AIG
SunAmerica in their Letters of Protest and in AIG’s
petition to the Tax Court. Although the final outcome of any
issues raised in connection with these examinations or the
litigation is uncertain, AIG believes that the tax obligation,
including interest thereon, will not be significant to
AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity. AGC’s tax years through 1999 have been audited
and settled with the IRS.

A component of life insurance surplus accumulated
prior to 1984 is not taxable unless it exceeds certain statutory
limitations or is distributed to shareholders. This surplus,
accumulated in policyholder surplus accounts, totaled
approximately $945 million at December 31, 2003. AIG
has not made any provision in the accompanying financial
statements for taxation of this amount as management has no
intention of making any distributions from this surplus.

Foreign income not expected to be taxed in the
United States has arisen because AIG’s foreign subsidiaries
were generally not subject to U.S. income taxes on income earned
prior to January 1, 1987. Such income would become subject
to U.S. income taxes at current tax rates if remitted to the
United States or if other events occur which would make these
amounts currently taxable. The cumulative amount of translated
undistributed earnings of AIG’s foreign subsidiaries
currently not subject to U.S. income taxes was approximately
$6.5 billion at December 31, 2003. Management has not
subjected, and has no current intention of subjecting, these
accumulated earnings to material U.S. income taxes and no
provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements
for such taxes.

(b) The pretax components of domestic and

was generated. The pretax domestic and foreign income was as
follows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001:

(c) The U.S. Federal income tax rate is
35 percent for 2003, 2002 and 2001. Actual tax expense on
income differs from the “expected” amount computed by
applying the Federal income tax rate because of the
following:

*

Foreign tax expense reflects the expense
    resulting from local tax regulation. Domestic tax expense
    includes U.S. taxes incurred on foreign income.

(d) The components of the net deferred
tax liability as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as
follows:

*

Included herein at December 31, 2003 were
    approximately $620 million of foreign tax credits. At
    December 31, 2003, approximately $400 million of such
    credits are expected to be utilized in the filing of the 2004
    tax return. The remaining credits are expected to be utilized
    prior to the expiration of such credits.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

The following reflects the policy acquisition
costs deferred for amortization against future income and the
related amortization charged to income for general and life
insurance operations, excluding certain amounts deferred and
amortized in the same period:

5.

Reinsurance

In the ordinary course of business, AIG’s
general and life insurance companies cede reinsurance to other
insurance companies in order to provide greater diversification
of AIG’s business and limit the potential for losses
arising from large risks.

General reinsurance is effected under reinsurance
treaties and by negotiation on individual risks. Certain of
these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss
contracts which protect AIG against losses over stipulated
amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance
premiums and are amortized into income over the contract period
in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable
from general reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent
with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and
presented as a component of reinsurance assets.

AIG life companies limit exposure to loss on any
single life. For ordinary insurance, AIG retains a maximum of
approximately $1.5 million of coverage per individual life with
respect to AIG’s overseas life operations and
$2.5 million of coverage per individual life with respect
to AIG’s domestic life operations. There are smaller
retentions for other lines of business. Life reinsurance is
effected principally under yearly renewable term treaties. The
premiums with respect to these treaties are considered prepaid
reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the
contract period in proportion to the protection provided.
Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a
manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying
policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance
assets.

General Insurance premiums written and earned
were comprised of the following:

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss
expenses incurred, amounted to $10.43 billion,
$10.28 billion and $8.80 billion, respectively.

GAAP Life premiums were comprised of the
following:

Life Insurance recoveries, which reduced death
and other benefits, approximated $651 million,
$624 million and $646 million, respectively, for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

AIG’s reinsurance arrangements do not
relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds. Thus, a
credit exposure exists with respect to both general and life
reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to
meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance agreements.
AIG holds substantial collateral as security under related
reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities and/or
letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated
unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely successful in
prior recovery efforts.

AIG evaluates the financial condition of its
reinsurers through an internal reinsurance security committee
consisting of members of AIG’s senior management. No single
reinsurer is a material reinsurer to AIG nor is AIG’s
business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract.

Life Insurance ceded to other insurance
companies was as follows:

Life Insurance assumed represented 0.1 percent,
0.2 percent and 0.2 percent of gross Life Insurance
in-force at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and GAAP Life
premiums assumed represented 0.2 percent, 0.2 percent
and 0.3 percent of gross GAAP premiums for the periods
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

are primarily accident and health products. The liability for
future life policy benefits has been established based upon the
following assumptions:

Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses and Future Life Policy
    Benefits and Policyholders’ Contract
    Deposits

(continued)

(i)

Interest
rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding annuities), which
vary by territory, year of issuance and products, range from
1.5 percent to 12.0 percent within the first
20 years. Interest rates on immediate/terminal funding
annuities are at a maximum of 11.5 percent and grade to not
greater than 6.2 percent.

(ii)

Mortality
and surrender rates are based upon actual experience by
geographical area modified to allow for variations in policy
form. The weighted average lapse rate, including surrenders, for
individual and group life approximated 6.0 percent.

(iii)

The
portions of current and prior net income and of current
unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to the
benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance
contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the
countries in which the policies are in force.

(iv)

Participating
life business represented approximately 28 percent of the
gross insurance in-force at December 31, 2003 and
38 percent of gross GAAP premiums in 2003. The amount of
annual dividends to be paid is determined locally by the Boards
of Directors. Provisions for future dividend payments are
computed by jurisdiction, reflecting local regulations.

(d)

The
liability for policyholders’ contract deposits has been
established based on the following assumptions:

(i)

Interest
rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by territory
and year of issuance, range from 1.5 percent to
9.0 percent. Current declared interest rates are generally
guaranteed to remain in effect for a period of one year though
some are guaranteed for longer periods. Withdrawal charges
generally range from zero percent to 16.0 percent grading
to zero over a period of zero to 15 years.

(ii)

Domestically,
GICs have market value withdrawal provisions for any funds
withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments. Interest rates
credited generally range from 1.2 percent to
9.0 percent. The vast majority of these GICs mature within
10 years. Overseas, interest rates credited on GICs
generally range from 1.5 percent to 6.9 percent and
maturities range from one to five years.

(iii)

Interest
rates on corporate life insurance products are guaranteed at
4.0 percent and the weighted average rate credited in 2003
was 5.8 percent.

(iv)

The
universal life funds have credited interest rates of
3.1 percent to 7.5 percent and guarantees ranging from
3.0 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of
issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to
surrender charges that amount to 11.0 percent of the
aggregate fund balance grading to zero over a period not longer
than 20 years.

(e)

Certain
products, which are short duration contracts, are subject to
experience adjustments. These include group life and group
medical products, credit life contracts, accident and
health insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and,
to a limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct
insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated
and recognized as revenue and the unearned portions of the
premiums are held as reserves. Experience adjustments vary
according to the type of contract and the territory in which the
policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance.

7.

Statutory Financial Data

Statutory surplus and net income for general
insurance and life insurance operations as reported to
regulatory authorities were as follows:

(a)

Includes loss reserve charge, net of tax of
    $1.8 billion.

(b)

Includes net realized capital gains and
    losses.

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries file financial
statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by domestic or foreign
insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between
statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign
jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory
financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition
costs and deferred income taxes, all bonds are carried at
amortized cost and assets and liabilities are presented net of
reinsurance. AIG’s use of permitted statutory accounting
practices does not have a significant impact on statutory
surplus.

(c) Medium Term Notes
Payable:

(i) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued
by AGF:

AGF’s Medium Term Notes are
unsecured obligations which generally may not be redeemed by AGF
prior to maturity and bear interest at either fixed rates set by
AGF at issuance or variable rates determined by reference to an
interest rate or other formula.

As of December 31, 2003, notes aggregating
$9.71 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging
from 2004 to 2013 at interest rates ranging from
1.16 percent to 7.50 percent. To the extent deemed

effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.

(ii) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued

unsecured obligations which may not be redeemed by ILFC prior to
maturity.

As of December 31, 2003, notes aggregating
$5.96 billion were outstanding with maturity dates from

8.26 percent. These notes provide for a single principal
payment at the maturity of each note.

(iii) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued
by AIG:

AIG’s Medium Term Notes are
unsecured obligations which generally may not be redeemed by AIG
prior to maturity and bear interest at either fixed rates set by
AIG at issuance or variable rates determined by reference to an
interest rate or other formula.

An analysis of AIG’s Medium Term Notes
for the year ended December 31, 2003 was as
follows:

The interest rates on AIG’s Medium Term
Notes range from 0.50 percent to 3.25 percent. To the
extent deemed appropriate, AIG may enter into swap transactions
to reduce its effective borrowing rates with respect to these
notes.

At December 31, 2003, Medium Term Notes
originally issued by SunAmerica, Inc. (SAI), which was merged
into AIG on January 1, 1999, aggregating $122 million
had maturity dates ranging from 2004 to 2026 at interest rates
ranging from 6.43 percent to 7.34 percent.

During 2000, AIG issued $210 million of
equity-linked Medium Term Notes due May 15, 2007. These
notes accrue interest at the rate of 0.50 percent and the
total return on these notes is linked to the appreciation in
market value of AIG’s common stock. The notes may be
redeemed, at the option of AIG, as a whole but not in part, at
any time on or after May 15, 2003. In conjunction with the
issuance of these notes, AIG entered into a series of swap
transactions which effectively converted its interest expense to
a fixed rate of 7.17 percent until May 15, 2003 and
0.50 percent thereafter and transferred the equity
appreciation exposure to a third party for the life of the
notes. AIG is exposed to credit risk with respect to the
counterparties to these swap transactions. During 2003,
$45 million of these notes were redeemed.

At December 31, 2003, AIG had
$140 million of debt securities registered and available
for issuance from time to time.

and the remainder are at fixed rates. These notes
provide for a single principal payment at maturity.

ILFC had $11.08 billion of debt securities
registered for public sale at December 31, 2003. During
2003, $6.09 billion of debt securities were issued. During
the second quarter of 2003, ILFC increased its Euro Medium Term
Note Program from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion, under
which $3.39 billion in notes were sold through
December 31, 2003. ILFC has substantially eliminated the
currency exposure arising from foreign-currency-denominated
notes by either hedging the notes through swaps, or through the
offset provided by operating lease payments. ILFC translates the
debt into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The foreign
exchange adjustment for the foreign-currency-denominated notes
was $697 million at December 31, 2003. Notes issued
under this program are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in
the accompanying table of borrowings.

ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit
Facility for use in connection with the purchase of
approximately 75 aircraft delivered through 2001. This facility
was guaranteed by various European Export Credit Agencies. The
interest rate varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent
on these borrowings depending on the delivery date of the
aircraft. At December 31, 2003, ILFC had $1.8 billion
outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a
pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title
to the aircraft financed under the facility. Borrowings with
respect to this facility are included in Notes and Bonds Payable.

During 2003, ILFC entered into various bank
financings for a total funded amount of $1.3 billion. The
financings mature through 2009. One tranche of one of the loans
totaling $410 million was funded in Japanese yen and
swapped to US dollars. The interest rates are LIBOR based
and ranged from 0.375 percent to 1.625 percent at
December 31, 2003.

obligations of ILFC.

statement by $7.5 billion. AGF had $9.1 billion of
debt securities registered and available for issuance at

Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in Subsidiary
    Companies

(continued)

classified in the liability caption entitled
“Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies subject to mandatory redemption.” (See also
Note 1 herein.)

(a) Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in
Subsidiary Companies Subject to Mandatory
Redemption:

At December 31,
2003, Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies subject to mandatory redemption represent preferred
stocks issued by certain AGC and HSB subsidiaries.

(i) AGC

:

The preferred stock has been issued by five subsidiary trusts
(the subsidiaries). The sole assets of these subsidiaries are
Junior Subordinated Debentures (Subordinated Debentures) issued
by AGC. These subsidiaries have no independent operations. The
Subordinated Debentures are eliminated in consolidation.

The interest terms and payment dates of the
Subordinated Debentures held by the subsidiaries correspond to
those of the subsidiaries’ preferred securities. AGC’s
obligations under the Subordinated Debentures and related
agreements, when taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by AGC of payments due on the preferred
securities. The Subordinated Debentures are redeemable, under
certain conditions, at the option of AGC on a proportionate
basis.

The preferred stock consists of $100 million
liquidation value of 8.05 percent preferred stock issued by
American General Capital III in December 2000, $300 million
liquidation value of 8.5 percent preferred stock issued by
American General Capital II in June 2000, $200 million
liquidation value of 7.875 percent preferred stock issued
by American General Capital I in September 1999,
$500 million liquidation value of 8.125 percent
preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital
B in March 1997, and $500 million liquidation value of
7.57 percent preferred stock issued by American General
Institutional Capital A in December 1996.

(ii) HSB

:

The preferred stock consists of $95 million liquidation
value of Exchange Capital Securities issued in July 1997 by HSB
Capital I, a statutory business trust wholly owned by HSB.
The sole assets of HSB Capital I are invested in debt securities
of HSB. The capital securities accrue and pay quarterly cash
distributions at a variable rate equal to 90 day LIBOR plus
0.91 percent of the stated liquidation amount of
$1,000 per capital security, which rate was
2.06 percent at December 31, 2003. The capital
securities are not redeemable prior to July 15, 2007 and
are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the debt
securities on July 15, 2027 or the earlier redemption of
the debt securities. AIG has issued a guarantee of the
obligations of HSB, which together with the terms of the debt
securities, the guarantee of

HSB with respect to the capital securities, the indenture and
the trust agreement with respect to the trust provide a full and
unconditional guarantee of payments due on the capital
securities. The trust is accounted for as a wholly owned
subsidiary of AIG. The debt securities issued to the trust and
the common securities issued by the trust to HSB are eliminated
in the consolidated balance sheet.

(b) Preferred shareholders’
equity in subsidiary companies

: As
of December 31, 2003, Preferred shareholders’ equity
in subsidiary companies represents preferred stocks issued by
ILFC and AIG Edison Life, wholly owned subsidiaries of AIG.

At December 31, 2003, the preferred stock
consists of 1,000 shares of market auction preferred stock
(“MAPS”) in two series (Series A and B) of
500 shares each. Each of the MAPS shares has a liquidation
value of $100,000 per share and is not convertible. The
dividend rate, other than the initial rate, for each dividend
period for each series is reset approximately every seven weeks
(49 days) on the basis of orders placed in an auction. ILFC
repurchased all of the shares of five additional series for
their liquidation value in the fourth quarter of 2001 and a
sixth in the first six months of 2002. No gains or losses were
recognized. During 2001, ILFC extended the term of the
Series A to five years at a dividend rate of
5.90 percent. At December 31, 2003, the dividend rate
for Series B was 1.54 percent.

11. Shareholders’ Equity

(a) AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries
for cash flow in the form of loans, advances and dividends.
AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory
restrictions on the amount of dividends which can be remitted to
AIG parent. These restrictions vary by state. For example,
unless permitted by the New York Superintendent of Insurance,
general insurance companies domiciled in New York may not pay
dividends to shareholders which in any twelve month period
exceed the lesser of 10 percent of the company’s
statutory policyholders’ surplus or 100 percent of its
“adjusted net investment income”, as defined.
Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both General
and Life Insurance companies exist in most of the other states
in which AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled.
Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which generally
cause only a temporary delay in the remittance of dividends.
There are also various local restrictions limiting cash loans
and advances to AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of
the restrictions, approximately 71 percent of consolidated
shareholders’ equity was restricted from immediate transfer
to AIG parent at December 31, 2003.

(b) At December 31, 2003, there were
6,000,000 shares of AIG’s $5 par value serial preferred
stock authorized, issuable in series, none of which were
outstanding.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

In the normal course of business, various
commitments and contingent liabilities are entered into by AIG
and certain of its subsidiaries. In addition, AIG guarantees
various obligations of certain subsidiaries.

(a) AIG and certain of its subsidiaries
become parties to derivative financial instruments with market
risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to
reduce currency, interest rate, equity and commodity exposures.
These instruments are carried at their estimated fair values in
the consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of AIG’s
derivative activity is transacted by Capital Markets. (See also
Note 21 herein.)

(b) Securities sold, but not yet purchased
and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent
obligations of Capital Markets operations to deliver specified
securities and spot commodities at their contracted prices, and
thereby record a liability to repurchase the securities and spot
commodities in the market at prevailing prices.

AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with
respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and
future payment obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and AIGTG
arising from transactions entered into by AIGFP and AIGTG. Net
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 from Capital Markets operations were
$1.85 billion, $1.54 billion and $1.35 billion,
respectively.

(c) At December 31, 2003, ILFC had
committed to purchase 463 new and used aircraft deliverable
from 2004 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price
of $26.2 billion and had options to purchase 11 new
aircraft deliverable from 2004 through 2008 at an estimated
aggregate purchase price of $705 million. ILFC will be
required to find customers for any aircraft acquired, and it
must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of
such equipment.

(d) AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with
the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation,
including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of
their business. AIG does not believe that such litigation will
have a material effect on its operating results and financial
condition. However, the recent trend of increasing jury awards
and settlements makes it somewhat more difficult to assess the
ultimate outcome of such litigation.

AIG continues to receive claims asserting
injuries from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other
environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the
cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites (hereinafter
collectively referred to as environmental claims) and indemnity
claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Estimation of asbestos
and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process,
as these claims, which emanate from policies written in 1984 and
prior years, cannot be estimated by conventional reserving
techniques. Asbestos and environmental claims development is
affected by factors such as inconsistent court resolutions, the
broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and
increasing number of new claims. AIG, together with other
industry members, has and will continue to litigate the
broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the
liability issues. If the courts continue in the future to expand
the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage, as
they have in the past, additional liabilities would emerge for
amounts in excess of reserves held. This emergence cannot now be
reasonably estimated, but could have a material impact on
AIG’s future operating results. The reserves carried for
these claims as at December 31, 2003 ($2.02 billion
gross; $669 million net) are believed to be adequate as
these reserves are based on known facts and current law.

(e) SAI Deferred Compensation Holdings,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, has established a
deferred compensation plan for registered representatives of
certain AIG subsidiaries, pursuant to which participants have
the opportunity to invest deferred commissions and fees on a
notional basis. The value of the deferred compensation
fluctuates with the value of the deferred investment
alternatives chosen. AIG has provided a full and unconditional
guarantee of the obligations of SAI Deferred Compensation
Holdings, Inc. to pay the deferred compensation under the plan.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments” (FAS 107) requires disclosure of fair
value information about financial instruments, as defined
therein, for which it is practicable to estimate such fair
value. In the measurement of the fair value of certain financial
instruments, where quoted market prices are not available, other
valuation techniques are utilized. These fair value estimates
are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies
based on available and observable market information.
FAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including
those related to insurance contracts.

The following methods and assumptions were used
by AIG in estimating the fair value of the financial instruments
presented:

Cash and short-term investments: The carrying
amounts approximate fair values.

Fixed maturity securities: Fair values were
generally based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed
maturity securities for which market prices were not readily
available, fair values were estimated using values obtained from
independent pricing services. No other fair valuation techniques
were applied to these securities as AIG believes it would have
to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Equity securities: Fair values were based upon
quoted market prices.

Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and
collateral loans: Where practical, the fair values of loans on
real estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted
cash flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental
lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the
policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have
to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Trading assets and trading liabilities: Fair
values approximate the carrying values.

Finance receivables: Fair values were estimated
using discounted cash flow calculations based upon the weighted
average rates currently being offered for similar finance
receivables.

Securities available for sale: Fair values were
based on quoted market prices. For securities and related hedges
for which market prices were not readily available, fair values
were estimated using quoted market prices of comparable
investments.

Securities lending collateral and securities
lending payable: The contract values of these financial
instruments approximate fair value.

Trading securities: Fair values were based on
current market value where available. For securities for which
market values were not readily available, fair values were
estimated using quoted market prices of comparable investments.

Spot commodities: Fair values were based on
current market prices.

Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate and
currency swaps, options and forward transactions: Fair values
were based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among
other things, current interest, foreign exchange and volatility
rates, as applicable.

Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to
resell (repurchase), at contract value: As these securities
(obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values
approximate fair values.

Other invested assets: For assets for which
market prices were not readily available, fair valuation
techniques were not applied as AIG believes it would have to
expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Policyholders’ contract deposits: Fair
values were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations
based upon interest rates currently being offered for similar
contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for
the contracts being valued.

GIAs: Fair values of AIG’s obligations under
investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash
flow calculations based on interest rates currently being
offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with
those remaining for the agreements being valued.

Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet
purchased: The carrying amounts for the financial instruments
approximate fair values. Fair values for spot commodities sold
short were based on current market prices.

Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and
other depositors: To the extent certain amounts are not demand
deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than
one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it
would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

(continued)

Commercial paper: The carrying amount
approximates fair value.

Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages: Where
practical, the fair values of these obligations were estimated
using discounted cash flow calculations based upon AIG’s
current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for
the debt being valued.

The carrying values and fair values of
AIG’s financial instruments at December 31, 2003 and
2002 and the average fair values with respect to derivative
positions during 2003 and 2002 were as follows:

Stock Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2003, AIG had three types of
stock-based compensation plans:

(i)

a stock option
plan;

(ii)

an incentive stock plan under which
restricted stock units had been issued; and

(iii)

an
employee stock purchase plan.

Effective January 1, 2003, AIG adopted the
recognition provision of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (FAS 123). This statement establishes
the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
employee compensation plans, such as AIG’s stock purchase
plan, stock option plan and stock incentive plan. Under the
recognition provisions of FAS 123, costs with respect to
stock compensation are measured using the fair value of the
shares subscribed or granted as at the date of grant recognized
ratably over the vesting period. Such fair value is derived
through an option pricing model.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure, an amendment
to FASB Statement No. 123” (FAS 148) was issued
in 2002. This statement amended FAS 123 and provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
recognition provisions of FAS 123. Also, FAS 148
amended certain of the disclosure requirements of FAS 123.

Stock Compensation
    Plans

(continued)

AIG has elected the “Prospective
Method” in the application of the recognition provisions as
prescribed by FAS 123. Such method provides for the
recognition of the fair value with respect to stock-based
compensation for shares subscribed for or granted on or after
January 1, 2003.

Prior to adoption of the recognition provisions
of FAS 123, as amended, AIG recognized stock compensation
in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. Shares
subscribed for or granted prior to January 1, 2003 will
continue to be accounted for pursuant to APB Opinion No. 25.

With respect to net income for
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the following table
provides a pro forma reconciliation as if AIG had adopted the
recognition provisions of FAS 123 at its
inception:

At December 31, 2002, AIG changed its
option-pricing model from the Black-Scholes model to a binomial
model (AIG model) that takes possible early exercise of options
into account. The AIG model uses AIG’s forfeiture and
exercise historical experiences to determine the option value.
It also takes into account the illiquid nature of employee
options, which the Black-Scholes model does not consider. For
these reasons, AIG believes that the AIG model provides a fair
value that is more representative of actual historic experience
than the value calculated in previous years.

The fair values with respect to 2001 were
recalculated using the AIG model. The pro forma recognition of
such fair value had insignificant impact on the pro forma
amounts disclosed above.

The fair values of stock options granted during
the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001
were $179 million, $140 million and $195 million,
respectively, including $90 million in fair value in 2001
with respect to shares granted in connection with the AGC
acquisition.

The following weighted average assumptions were
used for stock options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively: dividend yields of 0.32 percent,
0.26 percent and 0.19 percent; expected volatilities
of 34.0 percent, 34.0 percent and 32.0 percent;
risk-free interest rates of 3.57 percent, 4.33 percent
and 4.85 percent; and expected terms of 7 years in
each year.

Also included in the above table is the
compensation expense with respect to AIG’s employee stock
purchase plan. The fair value calculated was derived by using
the AIG model. The pro forma recognition of such fair value had
an insignificant impact on the pro forma amounts disclosed above.

The fair values of purchase privileges granted
during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
were $12 million, $8 million and $12 million,
respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of
those purchase rights granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
$11.64, $12.42 and $17.69, respectively. The fair value of each
purchase right was derived at the date of the subscription using
the AIG model.

The following weighted average assumptions were
used for purchase privileges granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively: dividend yields of 0.32 percent,
0.26 percent and 0.19 percent; expected volatilities
of 34.0 percent, 34.0 percent and 32.0 percent;
risk-free interest rates of 1.10 percent, 1.26 percent
and 3.17 percent; and expected terms of 1 year.

Stock Compensation
    Plans

(continued)

(a) Stock Option Plan:

The AIG 1999 Stock Option Plan, as
amended (the 1999 Plan), provides that options to purchase a
maximum of 45,000,000 shares of common stock can be granted to
certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors at
prices not less than fair market value at the date of grant. The
1999 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as to which stock
options may be granted to any employee in any one year to
900,000 shares. Options granted under this Plan expire not
more than 10 years from the date of the grant. Options with
respect to 25,000 shares, 25,000 shares,
27,500 shares and 25,000 shares were granted to
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors on May 14,
2003, February 10, 2003, May 15, 2002 and May 16,
2001, respectively. These options become exercisable on the
first anniversary of the date of grant, expire 10 years
from the date of grant and do not qualify for Incentive Stock
Option Treatment under the Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code (ISO Treatment). The 1999 Plan, and the options
previously granted thereunder, were approved by the shareholders
at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and certain
amendments were approved at the 2003 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. At December 31, 2003, 25,800,857 shares
were reserved for future grants under the 1999 Plan. The 1999
Plan superseded the 1991 employee stock option plan (the 1991
Plan) and the previously superseded 1987 employee stock option
plan (the 1987 Plan), although outstanding options granted under
the 1991 Plan continue in force until exercise or expiration. At
December 31, 2003, there were 27,607,998 shares
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan and the 1991 Plan.

During 2003 and 2002, AIG granted options with
respect to 137,300 shares and 356,034 shares,
respectively, which become exercisable on the fifth anniversary
of the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of
grant. These options do not qualify for ISO Treatment. The
agreements with respect to all other options granted to
employees under these plans in 2003 and 2002 provide that 25
percent of the options granted become exercisable on the
anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years
following that grant and expire 10 years from the date of
the grant. As of December 31, 2003, outstanding options
granted with respect to 13,709,768 shares qualified for ISO
Treatment.

At January 1, 1999, the merger date,
SunAmerica Inc. had five stock-based compensation plans pursuant
to which options, restricted stock and deferred share and share
unit obligations had been issued and remained outstanding.
Options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to
the market price on the date of grant, had a maximum term of ten
years and generally became exercisable ratably over a five-year
period. Substantially all of the SunAmerica Inc. options
outstanding at the merger date became fully vested on that date
and were converted into options to purchase AIG common stock at
the exchange ratio of 0.855 shares of AIG common stock for
each share of SunAmerica Inc. common stock. No further options
can be granted under the SunAmerica Inc. plans, but outstanding
options so converted continue in force until exercise or
expiration. At December 31, 2003, there were
17,449,772 shares of AIG common stock reserved for issuance
on exercise of options under these plans. None of these options
qualified for ISO Treatment as of December 31, 2003.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, deferred share and
share unit obligations with respect to 1,895 shares,
1,895 shares and 19,930 shares, respectively, of AIG
common stock vested and were issued. No additional deferred
share or share unit obligations may be granted under the
SunAmerica plans. As of December 31, 2003, deferred share
and share unit obligations with respect to 63,764 shares
remained outstanding under the SunAmerica plans.

The AIG Board of Directors has construed the AIG
stock option plans to allow deferral of delivery of
AIG shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of an
option to a date or dates specified by the optionee upon the
request of an optionee. During 2003, options with respect to
495,787 shares were exercised with delivery deferred. At
December 31, 2003, optionees had made valid elections to
defer delivery of 3,397,999 shares of AIG common stock upon
exercise of options expiring during 2004. In addition,
nonemployee directors of AIG made valid elections to defer
delivery of 63,280 shares and 42,186 shares of AIG
common stock upon exercise of options expiring during 2004 and
2005, respectively.

As a result of the acquisition of HSB in November
2000, HSB options outstanding at the acquisition date were fully
vested and were converted into options to purchase AIG common
stock at the exchange ratio of 0.4178 shares of AIG common
stock for each share of HSB common stock. No further options can
be granted under the HSB option plans, but outstanding options
so converted continue in force until exercise or expiration. At
December 31, 2003, there were 1,204,153 shares of AIG
common stock reserved for issuance under the HSB option plans,
none of which qualified for ISO Treatment.

At August 29, 2001, AGC had stock-based
compensation plans pursuant to which options and restricted
share units had been issued and remained outstanding. Options
granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the
market price on the date of the grant, had a maximum term of ten
years and generally became exercisable ratably over a three-year
period. All of the AGC options outstanding at the acquisition
date became fully vested on that date and were converted into
options to purchase AIG common stock at an exchange ratio of
0.5790 shares of AIG common stock for each share of AGC
common stock. No further options can be granted under the AGC
plans, but outstanding options so converted continue in force
until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2003, there
were 12,991,243 shares of AIG common stock reserved for
issuance on exercise of options under these plans. Options with
respect to 1,676,633 of these shares qualified for ISO
Treatment as of December 31, 2003.

Additional information with respect to
AIG’s plans at December 31, 2003, and changes for the
three years then ended, were as follows:

*

Includes 15,100,013 outstanding shares of AGC
    options.

In addition, at December 31, 2003, options
to purchase 358,594 shares at a weighted average exercise price
of $20.31

had been previously granted to AIG nonemployee directors and
remained outstanding.

Information about stock options outstanding at
December 31, 2003, is summarized as follows:

(b) 2002 Stock Incentive Plan:

AIG’s 2002 Stock Incentive
Plan was adopted at its 2002 shareholders’ meeting and
amended and restated by the AIG Board of Directors on
September 18, 2002. This plan provides that equity-based or
equity-related awards with respect to shares of common stock can
be issued to officers, employees or members of the Board of
Directors of AIG in any year up to a maximum of that number of
shares equal to (a) 1,000,000 shares plus (b) the
number of shares available but not issued in the prior calendar
year. Under the Plan, no grantee may receive awards covering
more than 250,000 shares of common stock. During 2003 and 2002,
AIG granted restricted stock units (RSUs) relating to
222,974 shares and 171,215 shares of common stock to
employees, respectively. These RSUs will vest on the fourth
anniversary of the date of grant assuming continued employment
through such date. AIG reserves the right to make payment for
the RSUs in shares of common stock or the cash equivalent on the
date of vesting. At December 31, 2003, there were
16,610,361 shares of common stock reserved for issuance in
connection with future grants of awards under the Plan.

(c) Performance-Based Restricted Stock
Units:

During 2002 and 2001, AIG
issued performance-based restricted stock units with respect to
4,783 shares and 124,365 shares,

respectively, of AIG common stock in connection
with contractual obligations as a result of the AGC acquisition.

(d) Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

AIG’s 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as amended and approved by AIG shareholders in
2003 (the 1996 Plan), provides that eligible employees
(those employed at least one year) may receive privileges to
purchase up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of AIG
common stock, at a price equal to 85 percent of the fair
market value on the date of the grant of the purchase privilege.
Purchase privileges are granted annually and are limited to the
number of whole shares that can be purchased by an amount equal
to 10 percent of an employee’s annual salary or
$10,000, whichever is less. There were 516,904 shares,
274,442 shares and 503,847 shares issued under the
1996 plan at weighted average prices of $48.03, $70.76 and
$62.02 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. The excess or deficit of the proceeds over
the par value or cost of the common stock issued was credited or
charged to additional paid-in capital.

As of December 31, 2003, there were
915,827 shares of common stock subscribed to at a weighted
average price of $46.13 per share pursuant to grants of
privileges under the 1996 plan. There were 5,033,850 shares
available for the grant of future purchase privileges under the
1996 plan at December 31, 2003.

15. Employee Benefits

(a) Pension Plans:

Employees of AIG, its subsidiaries
and certain affiliated companies, including employees in foreign
countries, are generally covered under various funded and
insured pension plans. Eligibility for participation in the
various plans is based on either completion of a specified
period of continuous service or date of hire, subject to age
limitations.

AIG’s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified,
noncontributory, defined benefit plan which is subject to the
provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. All employees of AIG and most of its subsidiaries and
affiliates who are regularly employed in the United States,
including certain U.S. citizens employed abroad on a U.S. dollar
payroll, and who have attained age 21 and completed twelve
months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this
plan. An employee with 5 or more years of service is entitled to
pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at age 65.
Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final
compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to
44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is

subject to certain limitations. The employee may elect certain
options with respect to their receipt of their pension benefits
including a joint and survivor annuity. An employee with 10 or
more years of service may retire early from age 55 to 64. An
early retirement factor is applied resulting in a reduced
benefit. If an employee terminates with less than 5 years of
service, such employee forfeits the right to receive any pension
benefits accumulated to that time. Annual funding requirements
are determined based on the “projected unit credit”
cost method, which attributes a pro rata portion of the total
projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each year of
credited service.

The HSB retirement plan was merged into the AIG
U.S. retirement plan effective April 1, 2001. The AGC
retirement plan was merged into the AIG U.S. retirement plan
effective January 1, 2002. Employees who participated in
the HSB retirement plan prior to April 1, 2001 are entitled
to benefits based on the terms and formulas of that plan.
Benefits for AGC participants were changed effective
January 1, 2003 to be substantially similar to the AIG U.S.
retirement plan benefits subject to grandfathering requirements.

AIG SunAmerica employees began participation and
accruing benefits in the AIG plan on January 1, 2003.
Vesting with respect to AIG SunAmerica employees in the AIG plan
begins on the later of January 1, 1999 or the date of hire.


st

Century Insurance Group sponsors
its own benefit plans for its eligible employees. Assets,
obligations and costs with respect to 21

st

Century’s plans are included herein. The assumptions used
in its plans were not significantly different from those used by
AIG in AIG’s U.S. plans.

The AIG Excess Retirement Income Plan provides a
benefit equal to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG
U.S. retirement plan as a result of federal tax limitations on
compensation and benefits payable thereunder. AIG has adopted a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental Plan) to
provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives
and key employees. Under the Supplemental Plan, an annual
benefit accrues at a percentage of final average pay multiplied
by each year of credited service, not greater than 60 percent of
final average pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and
any predecessor retirement plans (including the AIG Excess
Retirement Income Plan and any comparable plans), Social
Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior
employers. Currently, each of these plans are unfunded. AGC and
HSB have adopted similar supplemental type plans. These plans
are also unfunded.

Eligibility for participation in the various
non-U.S. retirement plans is either based on completion of a
specified period of continuous service or date of hire, subject
to age limitation. Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined
benefit plans, they are generally based on the employees’
years of credited service and average compensation in the years
preceding retirement.

(b) Postretirement
Plans:

In addition to AIG’s
defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a
postretirement benefit program for medical care and life
insurance, domestically and in certain foreign countries.
Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon
completion of a specified period of eligible service and
attaining a specified age. Benefits vary by geographic location.

AIG’s U.S. postretirement medical and life
insurance benefits are based upon the employee electing
immediate retirement and having a minimum of ten years of
service. Retirees who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 and
their dependents participate in the medical plan at no cost.
Employees who retired after May 1, 1989 and prior to
January 1, 1993 pay the active employee premium if under
age 65 and 50 percent of the active employee premium
if over age 65. Retiree contributions are subject to
adjustment annually. Other cost sharing features of the medical
plan include deductibles, coinsurance and Medicare coordination
and a lifetime maximum benefit of $2.0 million. The maximum
life insurance benefit prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a
maximum of $25,000 thereafter.

Effective January 1, 1993, both plans’
provisions were amended. Employees who retire after
January 1, 1993 are required to pay the actual cost of the
medical benefits premium reduced by a credit of a certain
amount, based on years of service at retirement. The amount of
this credit is subject to change. The life insurance benefit
varies by age at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at
ages 55 through 59; $10,000 for retirement at ages 60
through 64 and $15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over.

(c) Voluntary Savings
Plans:

AIG sponsors a voluntary
savings plan for domestic employees (the AIG 401(k) plan),
which, during the three years ended December 31, 2003,
provided for salary reduction contributions by employees and
matching contributions by AIG of up to 7 percent of annual
salary depending on the employees’ years of service.
Contributions were funded currently.

AGC sponsored a voluntary savings plan for its
employees (the AGC 401(k) plan), which was merged into the
AIG 401(k) plan on January 1, 2003.

HSB sponsored a voluntary savings plan for its
employees (the HSB 401(k) plan), which provided for salary
reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions
by HSB of up to 6 percent of annual salary. The HSB
voluntary savings plan merged into the AIG voluntary savings
plan on January 1, 2002. Contributions were funded
currently.

AIG SunAmerica sponsored a voluntary savings plan
for its employees (the SunAmerica 401(k) plan), which was merged
into the AIG 401(k) plan on January 1, 2003. Under an
Executive Savings Plan, designated AIG SunAmerica executives
also could defer up to 90 percent of cash compensation and
AIG SunAmerica matched 4 percent of the participants’
base salaries deferred. Contributions were funded currently.

(d) Post Employment
Benefits:

AIG provides certain
benefits to inactive employees who are not retirees. Certain of
these benefits are insured and expensed currently; other
expenses are provided for currently. Such uninsured expenses
include medical and life insurance continuation, and COBRA
medical subsidies.

(e) Benefit Obligations:

Accumulated benefit obligations
represent the present value of pension benefits earned as of
December 31, 2003 based on service and compensation as of
December 31, 2003. Projected benefit obligations for
defined benefit plans represent the present value of pension
benefits earned as of December 31, 2003 projected for
estimated pay increases as of an assumed date with respect to
retirement, termination, disability or death. Projected benefit
obligations for postretirement plans represent the present value
of postretirement medical and life insurance benefits deemed
earned as of December 31, 2003 projected for estimated pay
increases as of an assumed date with respect to retirement,
termination, disability or death.

The accumulated benefit obligations with
respect to both non-U.S. and U.S. pension benefit plans as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows:

The benefit obligations outside the United States
reflect those assumptions that were most appropriate for the
local economic environments of each of the subsidiaries
providing such benefits.

A 10.0 percent annual rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits for
AIG’s U.S. plans will be assumed for 2004. This rate is
assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0 percent through 2009
and remain at that level thereafter.

The assumed range for 2004 with respect to the
annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered
healthcare benefits of AIG’s non-U.S. plans is 8.0 to
9.5 percent. These rates are assumed to decrease gradually
to 5.0 percent after 3 to 9 years and remain at that
level thereafter.

A one percent point change in the assumed
healthcare cost trend rate would have the following effect on
AIG’s postretirement benefit obligations at
December 31, 2003:

(f) Funded Status:

The funded status of the AIG
defined benefit plans is a comparison of the pension benefit
obligations to the assets related to the respective plan, if
any. The difference between the two represents amounts that have
been appropriately recognized as expenses in prior periods or
represent amounts that will be recognized as expenses in the
future.

    particularly those in Japan, are not required by local
    regulation to be funded currently.

(b)

    benefits.

Defined benefit pension plan obligations where
the projected benefit obligation was in excess of the related
plan assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were as

(g) Plan
Assets:

AIG has excluded
certain information with respect to foreign pension plan assets.
Such information is not required to be disclosed until AIG fully
adopts FASB 132 (revised) at year-end 2004.

The following table sets forth the change in
plan assets as at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

The asset allocation percentage by major asset
class for AIG’s U.S. plan at December 31, 2003
and 2002, and the target allocation for 2004 follows:

Included in equity securities at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 were 1.2 million shares of
AIG common stock, with values of $80.0 million and
$69.9 million, respectively.

The investment strategy with respect to AIG U.S.
pension plan assets is to preserve capital and to seek
investment returns with a goal of fully funding the plan.

The expected rate of return with respect to
AIG’s domestic pension plan was 8.75 percent and
9.00 percent for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These rates of
return are an aggregation of expected returns within each asset
category. The return with respect to each asset class considers
both historical returns and the future expectations for such
returns.

(h) Expected Cash Flows:

With respect to the
U.S. pension plan, the actuarially prepared funding amount
ranges from the minimum amount AIG would be required to
contribute to the maximum amount that would be deductible for
U.S. tax purposes. This range is generally not determined
until the fourth quarter with respect to the contribution year.
Contributed amounts in excess of the minimum amounts are deemed
voluntary. Amounts in excess of the maximum amount would be
subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible under the
Internal Revenue Code. Supplemental and excess plans’
payments and postretirement plan payments are deductible when
paid.

AIG expects to contribute approximately
$100 million during 2004 to its U.S. pension plan,
depending on the actuarially calculated funding requirements of
such plan and pending Congressional legislation.

The expected future benefit payments, net of
participants’ contributions with respect to the U.S.
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are as
follows:

(i) Net Periodic Benefit Costs:

The following table presents the components of the net
periodic benefit costs with respect to pensions and other
benefits for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and

*

The benefit obligations outside the United
    States reflect those assumptions that were most appropriate for
    each local economic environment of the subsidiaries providing
    such benefits.

AIG’s postretirement plans provide benefits
primarily in the form of defined employer contributions as
opposed to defined employer benefits. As such, a change in the
assumed healthcare cost trend rate has little effect on
postretirement expense.

Starr International Company, Inc. Plan

Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO) provides
a Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plan (SICO Plan) to
certain AIG employees. The SICO Plan came into being in 1975
when the voting shareholders and Board of Directors of SICO, a
private holding company whose principal asset consists of AIG
common stock, decided that a portion of the capital value of
SICO should be used to provide an incentive plan for the current
and succeeding managements of all American International
companies, including AIG.

Participation in the SICO Plan by any person, and
the amount of such participation, is at the sole discretion of
SICO’s Board of Directors, and none of the costs of the
various benefits provided under such plan is paid by or charged
to AIG. The SICO Plan provides that shares currently owned by
SICO may be set aside by SICO for the benefit of the participant
and distributed upon retirement. The SICO Board of Directors may
permit an early payout of units under certain circumstances.
Prior to payout, the participant is not entitled to vote,
dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such shares, and
shares are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions,
including but not limited to the participant’s voluntary
termination of employment with AIG prior to normal retirement
age. In addition, SICO’s Board of Directors may elect to
pay a participant cash in lieu of shares of AIG common stock. If
the expenses of the SICO Plan had been reflected by AIG, the
pretax amounts accrued would have been $129.6 million,
$49.4 million and $55.7 million for 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

(a) AIG and its subsidiaries occupy leased
space in many locations under various long-term leases and have
entered into various leases covering the long-term use of data
processing equipment.

At December 31, 2003, the future minimum
lease payments under operating leases were as follows:

Rent expense approximated $524 million,
$503 million and $472 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.

(b) Minimum future rental income on
noncancelable operating leases of flight equipment which have
been delivered at December 31, 2003 was as
follows:

Flight equipment is leased, under operating
leases, with remaining terms ranging from one to 15 years.

Ownership and Transactions With Related Parties

(a) Ownership:

The directors and officers of AIG,
together with C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. (Starr), a private
holding company, The Starr Foundation and Starr International
Company, Inc. (SICO), a private holding company, owned or
otherwise controlled approximately 20 percent of the voting
stock of AIG at December 31, 2003. Five directors of AIG
also serve as directors of Starr and SICO.

(b) Transactions with Related
Parties:

During the ordinary
course of business, AIG and its subsidiaries pay commissions to
Starr and its subsidiaries for the production and management of
insurance business. There are no significant receivables
from/payables to related parties at December 31, 2003.
Payment for the production of insurance business to Starr
aggregated approximately $173 million in 2003,
$114 million in 2002 and $87 million in 2001, from
which Starr generally is required to pay commissions due
originating brokers and its operating expenses. AIG also
received approximately $24 million in 2003,
$17 million in 2002 and $14 million in 2001 from Starr
and paid approximately $114,000 in 2003, $352,000 in 2002 and
$320,000 in 2001 to Starr in rental fees and $262,000 for
services in 2003, 2002 and 2001. AIG also received approximately
$2 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002 and
$4 million in 2001, respectively, from SICO and paid
approximately $1 million in each of the years 2003, 2002
and 2001 to SICO as reimbursement for services rendered at cost.
AIG also paid to SICO $4 million in 2003, $5 million
in 2002, and $4 million in 2001 in rental fees.

Acquisition, Restructuring and Related Charges

During the third quarter of 2001, AGC was
acquired and consolidated into AIG; charges in connection with
this acquisition totaled $1.36 billion for that quarter.
During the second quarter of 2001, AGC incurred
$654 million in connection with the termination of its
merger agreement with Prudential plc. Thus, in 2001, AIG
incurred $2.02 billion of charges in connection with the
acquisition of AGC.

With respect to the charges of $1.36 billion
incurred in the third quarter of 2001, approximately
$512 million was related to direct costs of the
acquisition. Of the $512 million, $85 million was
attributable to investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
The remaining direct costs of $427 million were related to
employee severance and other termination benefits, and other
compensation costs related to change in control agreements with
AGC executives. The costs were also based in part on a projected
elimination of positions, in accordance with AIG’s
postbusiness combination plans, which were intended to enhance
the effectiveness and efficiency of the combined operations.

Acquisition, Restructuring and Related
    Charges

(continued)

Of the total direct costs of $512 million,
$445 million have been paid as of December 31, 2003,
including approximately $29 million, $111 million and
$305 million paid during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
In addition, during 2002, $32 million of liabilities were
utilized to absorb other insignificant merger-related expenses.
The balance, $35 million, is recorded as a component of
“Other Liabilities” as of December 31, 2003.

With respect to the elimination of positions,
2,287 terminations were included in AIG’s original
postbusiness combination plans. As of December 31, 2003,
terminations totaled 2,250; including 536, 1,105 and 609 made
during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The remaining
37 terminations are scheduled to occur in 2004, in
accordance with AGC’s employee termination program.

The indirect costs of $851 million
represented charges resulting from post-business combination
plans, recognizing that certain assets will have no future
economic benefit or ability to generate future revenues. Such
charges include asset impairments charges related to software,
leasehold improvements and certain goodwill. Also included were
certain adjustments associated with conforming AGC’s
balances to AIG’s existing accounting policies and
methodologies. Of the $851 million, $795 million had
been applied as of December 31, 2003; including
$13 million, $113 million and $669 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The balance,
$56 million, remains outstanding and is reflected as a
component of “Other Liabilities” as of
December 31, 2003.

20. Special Purpose Vehicles

In January 2003, FASB issued FIN46. FIN46 changes
the method of determining whether certain entities should be
consolidated in AIG’s consolidated financial statements. An
entity is subject to FIN46 and is called a Variable Interest
Entity (VIE) if it has (i) equity that is insufficient to
permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties, or
(ii) equity investors that cannot make significant
decisions about the entity’s operations, or that do not
absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of
the entity. A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary,
which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or
a majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both.
All other entities not considered VIEs are evaluated for
consolidation under existing guidance. In December 2003, FASB
issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN46R).

The provisions of FIN46R are to be applied
immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to
VIEs in which AIG obtains an interest after that date. For VIEs
in which AIG holds a variable interest that it acquired before
February 1, 2003, FIN46R was applied as of
December 31, 2003. For any VIEs that must be consolidated
under FIN 46R that were created before February 1,
2003, the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the
VIEs would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with
any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet
and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change. In accordance with
the transition provisions of FIN46R, AIG recorded a gain of
$9 million ($14 million before tax) reported as a
cumulative effect of an accounting change for the fourth quarter
of 2003 and added approximately $4.7 billion of assets and
liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003.

Of the $4.7 billion, approximately
$4.2 billion relates to assets and liabilities arising from
AIG’s real estate partnerships, principally connected to
affordable housing transactions involving AIG SunAmerica
subsidiaries, and private equity partnerships managed by AIG
Global Investment Group and AIG Capital Partners.

The remaining approximately $500 million
involves ILFC, and arises principally from a sale-leaseback
transaction.

The following VIE activities are not consolidated
by AIG under FIN46R:

•

AIG uses VIEs primarily in connection with
    certain guaranteed investment contract programs (GIC Programs)
    written by its Life Insurance subsidiaries. In the GIC Programs,
    AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries (principally SunAmerica
    Life Insurance Company) provide guaranteed investment contracts
    to VIEs which are not controlled by AIG, and in which AIG does
    not have a direct variable interest, as defined under
    FIN 46R, in the entity. The VIE issues notes or bonds which
    are sold to third party institutional investors. Neither AIG nor
    the insurance company issuing the GICs has any obligation to the
    investors in the notes or bonds. The proceeds from the
    securities issued by the VIE are invested by the VIE in the
    GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use their proceeds to
    invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily
    investment grade bonds. Both the assets and the liabilities of
    the insurance companies arising from these GIC Programs are
    presented in AIG’s consolidated balance sheet. Thus, at
    December 31, 2003, approximately $36 billion of
    policyholders’ contract deposits represented liabilities
    from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs, the
    proceeds of which are used to invest in insurance invested
    assets.

•

AIG manages Collateralized Bond and Loan
    Obligation trusts (collectively, Collateralized Debt Obligation
    trusts or “CDO trusts”). As asset manager, AIG
    receives fees for management of the assets held in the CDO
    trust, which support the issuance of securities sold by the CDO
    trust. AIG may take minority equity and/or fixed-income security
    interest in the CDO trust. AIG has entered into such
    arrangements to expand its asset management activities.
    Third-party investors have recourse only to the CDO trust, and
    have no recourse to AIG. AIG does not consolidate these CDO
    trusts, pursuant to FIN46R.

•

AIG’s insurance operations also invest in
    assets of VIEs. These VIEs are established by unrelated third
    parties. Investments include collateralized mortgage backed
    securities and similar securities backed by pools of mortgages,
    consumer receivables or other assets. The investment in these
    VIEs allows AIG’s insurance entities to purchase assets
    permitted by insurance regulations while maximizing their return
    on these assets. These VIEs are not consolidated by AIG,
    pursuant to FIN46R.

AIGFP is also involved with various special
purpose vehicles that are not considered VIEs but rather are
considered voting interest entities and are not governed by
FIN46R. AIGFP uses such entities as an integral part of its
ongoing operations with respect to specific structured
transactions with independent third parties. In most instances,
AIGFP controls and manages the assets and liabilities with
respect to these entities, subject to certain transaction
specific limitations. AIGFP generally consolidates these
entities under previously issued GAAP guidance. AIGFP also
sponsors a Qualified Special Purpose Vehicle (QSPE) that issues
commercial paper and secured liquidity notes to third-party
institutional investors. This QSPE uses the proceeds of these
offerings to obtain beneficial interests in certain financial
assets (total assets of approximately $883 million), which
serve as collateral for the securities issued by the QSPE. AIGFP
provides credit and liquidity support to the QSPE, which is not
consolidated by AIG, pursuant to other guidance (QSPEs are
generally not subject to FIN46R).

21.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial arrangements among two
or more parties. The returns of the derivatives are linked to or
“derived” from some underlying equity, debt, commodity
or other asset, liability, or index. Derivative payments may be
based on interest rates and exchange rates and/or prices of
certain securities, certain commodities, of financial or
commodity indices. These instruments are carried at fair value
in the consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is required, at
the discretion of AIG, on certain transactions based on the
creditworthiness of the counterparty.

The vast majority of AIG’s derivative
activity is transacted by Capital Markets operations. AIGFP and
AIGTG become parties to derivative financial instruments in the
normal course of business and to reduce currency, interest rate,
commodity and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency,
commodity and equity risks related to such instruments are
reflected in the consolidated financial statements and are
carried at a market or a fair value, whichever is appropriate.
The recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be
different than the values that might be realized if AIGFP or
AIGTG were required to sell or close out the transactions prior
to maturity.

Derivatives

(continued)

AIGFP and AIGTG, in the ordinary course of
operations and as principal, structure derivative transactions
to meet the needs of counterparties who may be seeking to hedge
certain aspects of such counterparties’ operations. These
companies may also enter into derivative transactions for their
own account, primarily to manage risk. Such derivative
transactions include interest rate, currency, commodity and
equity swaps, swaptions and forward commitments. Interest rate
swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and
floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange
of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP and AIGTG typically
become a principal in the exchange of interest payments between
the parties and, therefore, are exposed to counterparty credit
risk and may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default.
Currency, commodity and equity swaps are similar to interest
rate swaps, but involves the exchange of specific currencies or
the cashflows based on the underlying commodity, and equity
securities or indices. Also, they may involve the exchange of
principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction.
Swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the
obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an
existing swap transaction. At December 31, 2003, the
notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and
receives contracts approximated $1,176.7 billion, primarily
related to interest rate swaps of approximately
$756.9 billion.

Notional amounts represents a standard of
measurement of the volume of swaps business of Capital Markets
operations. Notional amount is not a quantification of market
risk or credit risk and is not recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet. Notional amounts generally represent those
amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged
and are not paid or received, except for certain contracts such
as currency swaps.

The timing and the amount of cash flows relating
to Capital Markets foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded
futures and options contracts are determined by each of the
respective contractual agreements.

The following table presents the contractual
and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of
Capital Markets derivatives portfolio at December 31, 2003
and 2002:

*

Notional amount is not representative of
    either market risk or credit risk.

Futures and forward contracts are contracts that
obligate the holder to sell or purchase foreign currencies,
commodities or financial indices in which the seller/ purchaser
agrees to make/ take delivery at a specified future date of a
specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. Options are
contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or
sell the underlying commodity, currency or index at a specified
price and within, or at, a specified period of time. As a writer
of options, AIGFP generally receives an option premium and then
manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the
underlying commodity, currency or index by entering into
offsetting transactions with third party market participants.
Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices
from contracted prices, and the potential inability of the
counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts. At
December 31, 2003, the contractual amount of Capital
Markets futures, forward and option contracts approximated
$250.9 billion.

The following table presents Capital Markets
futures, forward and option contracts portfolio by maturity and
type of derivative at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

AIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions
in the ordinary course of its business. The overwhelming
majority of AIGFP’s credit derivatives require AIGFP to
provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or
debt securities. AIGFP provides such credit protection only on a
“second loss” basis, under which AIGFP’s payment
obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated
portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of
“first losses.” The threshold amount of credit losses
that must be realized before AIGFP has any payment obligation is
negotiated by AIGFP for each transaction to provide that the
likelihood of any payment obligation by AIGFP under each
transaction is remote, even in severe recessionary market
scenarios.

In many cases, the credit risk associated with a
designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk,
which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies.
Typically, there will be an equity layer covering the first
credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified
percentage of the total portfolio, and then successive layers
that are rated, generally a BBB-rated layer, an A-rated layer,
an AA-rated layer and an AAA-rated layer. In transactions that
are rated, the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior
to the threshold level above which AIGFP’s payment
obligation would arise is rated AAA by the rating agencies. For
that reason, the risk layer assumed by AIGFP with respect to the
designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the
“super senior” risk layer, defined as the layer of
credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated AAA by
the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated,
equivalent thereto. For example, in a transaction with an equity
layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the
total portfolio, a BBB-rated layer covering credit losses from 2
to 4 percent, an A-rated layer from 4 to 6 percent, an
AA-rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and a AAA-rated layer
from 8 to 11 percent. AIGFP would cover credit losses
arising in respect of the portfolio that exceeded an
11 percent first loss threshold amount, and thereby bear
risk that is senior to the AAA-rated risk layer.

AIGFP continually monitors the underlying
portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for
any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of AIGFP
having a payment obligation under the transaction to be super
senior risk. AIGFP maintains the ability opportunistically to
hedge specific securities in a portfolio and thereby further
limit its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding
transactions in this manner on occasion. AIGFP has never had a
payment obligation under these credit derivatives transactions.
Furthermore, based on portfolio credit losses experienced to
date under all outstanding transactions, no transaction has
experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the
likelihood of AIGFP having to make a payment, in AIGFP’s
view, to be greater than remote, even in severe recessionary
market scenarios. At December 31, 2003, the notional amount
with respect to the Capital Markets credit derivative portfolio
was $203.0 billion.

Derivatives

(continued)

AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements,
including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit
triggers, credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the
credit exposure relating to these derivative financial
instruments. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection
with specific transactions based on, among other things, the
creditworthiness of the counterparties and the
transaction’s size and maturity. In addition, Capital
Markets derivative transactions are generally documented under
ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes that such agreements
provide for legally enforceable set-off and close out netting of
exposures to specific counterparties. Under such agreements, in
connection with an early termination of a transaction, AIGFP is
permitted to set-off its receivables from a counterparty against
its payables to the same counterparty arising out of all
included transactions. As a result, the fair value represents
the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the
application of such strategies, agreements and collateral held.
After consideration of these credit enhancements, AIGFP has
determined that the fair value of its obligations under all
interest rate, currency, commodity and equity swaps, options,
swaptions and forward commitments, futures and forward contracts
approximated $21.60 billion at December 31, 2003 and
$17.38 billion at December 31, 2002. The fair value
represents the maximum potential loss to AIGFP.

AIGFP independently evaluates the
creditworthiness of its counterparties, taking into account
credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating
organizations. In addition, AIGFP’s credit approval process
involves pre-set counterparty, country and industry credit
exposure limits and, for particularly credit intensive
transactions, obtaining approval from AIG’s Credit Risk
Committee. The average credit rating of Capital Markets
operations counterparties as a whole (as measured by AIGFP) is
equivalent to AA. The maximum potential loss will increase or
decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a
function of maturity and market conditions.

Capital Markets determines counterparty credit
quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies
or, where such ratings are not available, by internal analysis.
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the counterparty credit
quality with respect to the fair value of Capital Markets
derivatives portfolios were as follows:

(a)

Exchange traded futures and options are not
    deemed to have significant credit exposures as the exchanges
    guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a
    daily basis.

(b)

The fair values with respect to exchange
    traded futures and options, forward contracts and purchased over
    the counter options are presented as a component of trading
    assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The fair
    values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps are
    presented as a component of unrealized gain on interest rate and
    currency swaps, options and forward transactions in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the fair
value of Capital Markets derivatives portfolio was as
follows:

*

Exchange traded futures and options are not
    deemed to have significant credit exposures as the exchanges
    guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a
    daily basis.

Controls and Procedures

AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
the reports that AIG files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by AIG in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
AIG’s management, including AIG’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. AIG’s
management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the
effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
that evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures provided reasonable assurance of effectiveness as of
the end of the period covered by this report. In addition, there
has been no change in AIG’s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.
