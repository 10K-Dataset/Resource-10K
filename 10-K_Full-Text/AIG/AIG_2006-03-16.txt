Throughout this Annual Report on
Form

10-K,

AIG
presents its operations in the way it believes will be most
meaningful, as well as most transparent. Certain of the
measurements used by AIG management are “non-GAAP financial
measures” under SEC rules and regulations. Statutory
underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios are determined in
accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance
regulatory authorities. For an explanation of why AIG management
considers these “non-GAAP measures” useful to
investors, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The Restatements

AIG has completed two restatements of its financial statements
(the Restatements). In connection with the first restatement
(the First Restatement), AIG restated its consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the quarters ended
March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004 and 2003
and the quarter ended December 31, 2003. In the second
restatement (the Second Restatement), AIG restated its
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, along with 2001 and 2000 for purposes of preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Data for 2001 and 2000, the quarterly
financial information for 2004 and 2003 and the first three
quarters of 2005. AIG, however, did not amend its quarterly
report on
Form

10-Q

for the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 because the adjustments to
the financial statements included therein were not material to
those financial statements. All financial information included
in this Annual Report on
Form

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

General Insurance Operations

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line
companies writing substantially all lines of property and
casualty insurance both domestically and abroad. Domestic
General Insurance operations are comprised of the Domestic
Brokerage Group (DBG), which includes the operations of HSB;
Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic); Personal Lines,
including 21st Century Insurance Group (21st Century); and
United Guaranty Corporation (UGC).

AIG’s primary domestic division is DBG. DBG’s business
in the United States and Canada is conducted through its General
Insurance subsidiaries including American Home, National Union,
Lexington and certain other General Insurance company
subsidiaries of AIG.

DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance,
accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers. This
provides DBG the opportunity to select specialized markets and
retain underwriting control. Any licensed broker is able to
submit business to DBG without the traditional agent-company
contractual relationship, but such broker usually has no
authority to commit DBG to accept a risk.

In addition to writing substantially all classes of business
insurance, including large commercial or industrial property
insurance, excess liability, inland marine, environmental,
workers compensation and excess and umbrella coverages, DBG
offers many specialized forms of insurance such as aviation,
accident and health, equipment breakdown, directors and officers
liability (D&O), difference-in-conditions, kidnap-ransom,
export credit and political risk, and various types of
professional errors and omissions coverages. The AIG Risk
Management operation provides insurance and risk management
programs for large corporate customers. The AIG Risk Finance
operation is a leading provider of customized structured
insurance products. Also included in DBG are the operations of
AIG Environmental, which focuses specifically on providing
specialty products to clients with environmental exposures.
Lexington writes surplus lines, those risks for which
conventional insurance companies do not readily provide
insurance coverage, either because of complexity or because the
coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts.

Certain of the products of the DBG companies include funding
components or have been structured in a manner such that little
or no insurance risk is actually transferred. Funds received in
connection with these products are recorded as deposits,
included in other liabilities, rather than premiums and incurred
losses.

The AIG Worldsource Division introduces and coordinates
AIG’s products and services to

U.S.-based

multinational clients and foreign corporations doing business in
the U.S.

Transatlantic subsidiaries offer reinsurance capacity on both a
treaty and facultative basis both in the U.S. and abroad.
Transatlantic structures programs for a full range of property
and casualty products with an emphasis on specialty risk.

AIG’s Personal Lines operations provide automobile
insurance through AIG Direct, the mass marketing operation of
AIG, Agency Auto Division and 21st Century, as well as a broad
range of coverages for high net-worth individuals through the
AIG Private Client Group.

The main business of the UGC subsidiaries is the issuance of
residential mortgage guaranty insurance on conventional first
lien mortgages for the purchase or refinance of 1-4 family
residences. This type of insurance protects lenders in both
domestic and international markets against loss if borrowers
default. Other UGC subsidiaries write second lien and private
student loan guaranty insurance. The second lien coverage
protects lenders against loss from default on home equity and
closed-end second mortgages used to finance home improvements,
repairs or other expenses not directly related to the purchase
of a borrower’s home. Private student loan guaranty
insurance protects lenders against loss if the student, or in
many cases the student’s parent, defaults on their
education loan. UGC had approximately $23 billion of
guaranty risk in force at December 31, 2005.

AIG’s Foreign General Insurance group accepts risks
primarily underwritten through American International
Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned
agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General Insurance
group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based
insurance subsidiaries. The Foreign General group uses various
marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write
both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain
refinements for local laws, customs and needs. AIU operates in
Asia, the Pacific Rim, the United Kingdom, Europe, Africa, the
Middle East and Latin America. See also Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2005, DBG and the Foreign General Insurance group
accounted for 55 percent and 24 percent, respectively,
of AIG’s General Insurance net premiums written.

AIG’s General Insurance company subsidiaries worldwide
operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their
direct account and securing reinsurance on that portion of the
risk in excess of the limit which they wish to retain. This
operating policy differs from that of many insurance companies
that will underwrite only up to their net retention limit,
thereby requiring the broker or agent to secure commitments from
other underwriters for the remainder of the gross risk amount.

Certain of DBG’s commercial insurance is reinsured on a
quota share basis by AIRCO. Various AIG profit centers,
including AIU, AIG Reinsurance Advisors, Inc. and AIG Risk
Finance, use AIRCO as a reinsurer for certain of their
businesses, and AIRCO also receives premiums from offshore
fronting arrangements for clients of AIG subsidiaries. In
accordance with permitted accounting practices in Bermuda, AIRCO
discounts reserves attributable to certain classes of business
assumed from other AIG subsidiaries. See Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – “Operating Review –
Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses.”

AIG

10-K


The utilization of reinsurance is closely monitored by senior
management and AIG’s Credit Risk Committee. AIG believes
that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an
inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is AIG’s
business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contract.
See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

AIG is diversified both in terms of classes of business and
geographic locations. In General Insurance, approximately
15 percent of net premiums written for the year ended
December 31, 2005 represented workers compensation
business. During 2005, of the direct General Insurance premiums
written (gross premiums less return premiums and cancellations,
excluding reinsurance assumed and before deducting reinsurance
ceded), 11 percent and 7 percent were written in
California and New York, respectively. No other state accounted
for more than five percent of such premiums.

The majority of AIG’s General Insurance business is in the
casualty classes, which tend to involve longer periods of time
for the reporting and settling of claims. This may increase the
risk and uncertainty with respect to AIG’s loss reserve
development. See also the Discussion and Analysis of
Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development in
this Item 1. Business and Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

A significant portion of AIG’s General Insurance operating
revenue is derived from AIG’s insurance investment
operations. For a table summarizing the investment results of
General Insurance see “Insurance Investments
Operations” below. See also Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations
and Notes 1, 2 and 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated
Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve Development

The reserve for net losses and loss expenses represents the
accumulation of estimates for reported losses (case basis
reserves) and provisions for losses incurred but not reported
(IBNR), both reduced by applicable reinsurance recoverable and
the discount for future investment income. Losses and loss
expenses are charged to income as incurred.

Loss reserves established with respect to foreign business are
set and monitored in terms of the respective local or functional
currency. Therefore, no assumption is included for changes in
currency rates. See also Note 1(bb) of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves
through the utilization of a number of analytical reserve
development techniques. Through the use of these techniques,
management is able to monitor the adequacy of AIG’s
established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for
inflation. Also, analysis of emerging specific development
patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and
IBNR emergence, allows management to determine any required
adjustments. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The “Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense
Reserve Development” table presents the development of net
losses and loss expense reserves for calendar years 1995 through
2005. Immediately following this table is a second table that
presents all data on a basis that excludes asbestos and
environmental net losses and loss expense reserve development.
The opening reserves held are shown at the top of the table for
each year end date. The amount of loss reserve discount included
in the opening reserve at each date is shown immediately below
the reserves held for each year. The undiscounted reserve at
each date is thus the sum of the discount and the reserve held.
The upper half of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid
during successive years related to the undiscounted opening loss
reserves. For example, in the table that excludes asbestos and
environmental losses, with respect to the net losses and loss
expense reserve of $24.55 billion as of December 31,
1998, by the end of 2005 (seven years later) $24.75 billion
had actually been paid in settlement of these net loss reserves.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the
original reserve of $25.45 billion was reestimated to be
$30.64 billion at December 31, 2005. This increase
from the original estimate would generally result from a
combination of a number of factors, including reserves being
settled for larger amounts than originally estimated. The
original estimates will also be increased or decreased as more
information becomes known about the individual claims and
overall claim frequency and severity patterns. The redundancy
(deficiency) depicted in the table, for any particular calendar
year, shows the aggregate change in estimates over the period of
years subsequent to the calendar year reflected at the top of
the respective column heading. For example, the deficiency of
$3.75 billion at December 31, 2005 related to
December 31, 2004 net losses and loss expense reserves of
$47.30 billion represents the cumulative amount by which
reserves for 2004 and prior years have developed deficiently
during 2005. The deficiency that has emerged in the last year
can be attributed primarily to the excess casualty, excess
workers compensation, and D&O and related management
liability classes of business. These classes in total produced
approximately $4 billion of adverse development in 2005,
primarily related to claims from accident years 2002 and prior.
For most other classes, accident years 2002 and prior generally
produced adverse development in 2005, whereas accident year 2004
generally produced favorable development. In total, the
favorable development for all classes of business for accident
year 2004 was approximately $3.85 billion. The accident
year emergence can be seen by comparing the respective
development in 2005 for each column’s loss reserve in the
table that follows. Loss development patterns utilized to test
the reserves generally rely on the actual historical loss
development patterns of prior accident years for each class of
business. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further
discussion of loss development in 2005.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The bottom of each table below shows the remaining undiscounted
and discounted net loss reserve for each year. For example, in
the table that excludes asbestos and environmental losses, for
the 2000 year-end, the remaining undiscounted reserves held as
of December 31, 2005 are $10.01 billion, with a
corresponding discounted net reserve of $9.32 billion.

The reserves for net losses and loss expenses with respect to
Transatlantic and 21st Century are included only in consolidated
net losses and loss expenses commencing with the year ended
December 31, 1998, the year they were first consolidated in
AIG’s financial statements. Reserve development for these
operations is included only for 1998 and subsequent periods.
Thus, the presentation for 1997 and prior year ends is not fully
comparable to that for 1998 and subsequent years in the tables

The reserve for losses and loss expenses as reported in
AIG’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005
differs from the total reserve reported in the Annual Statements
filed with state insurance departments and, where appropriate,
with foreign regulatory authorities. The differences at
December 31, 2005 relate primarily to reserves for certain
foreign operations not required to be reported in the United
States for statutory reporting purposes.

The reserve for gross losses and loss expenses is prior to
reinsurance and represents the accumulation for reported losses
and IBNR. Management reviews the adequacy of established gross
loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss
reserves.

loss expenses, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services Operations

AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries
offer a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products
both domestically and abroad. Insurance-oriented products
consist of individual and group life, payout annuities,
endowment and accident and health policies. Retirement savings
products consist generally of fixed and variable annuities. See
also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations in foreign
countries comprised 78 percent of Life Insurance &
Retirement Services GAAP premiums and 59 percent of Life
Insurance & Retirement Services operating income in 2005.
AIG operates overseas principally through ALICO, AIA, Nan Shan,
Philamlife, AIG Star Life, and AIG Edison Life. ALICO is
incorporated in Delaware and all of its business is written
outside of the United States. ALICO has operations either
directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, Latin America, the
Caribbean, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East, with
Japan being the largest territory. AIG added significantly to
its presence in Japan with the acquisition of GE Edison Life
Insurance Company (now AIG Edison Life), which was consolidated
beginning with the fourth quarter of 2003. AIA operates
primarily in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, and India. The
operations in India are conducted through a joint venture, Tata
AIG Life Insurance Company Limited. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan.
Philamlife is the largest life insurer in the Philippines. AIG
Star Life operates in Japan. See also Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for
AIG’s foreign life operations. This facilitates insurance
risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and
capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows
AIG to pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more
efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty
risk and relationships and manage global life catastrophe risks.

AIG’s principal domestic Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations include AGLA, AIG American
General, AIG Annuity, USLIFE, VALIC and SunAmerica Life. These
companies utilize multiple distribution channels including
independent producers, brokerage, career agents and banks to
offer life insurance, annuity and accident and health products
and services, as well as financial and other investment
products. The domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations comprised 22 percent of total Life
Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums and
41 percent of Life Insurance & Retirement Services
operating income in 2005.

Life insurance products such as whole life and endowment
continue to be significant in the overseas companies, especially
in Southeast Asia, while a mixture of life insurance, accident
and health and retirement services products are sold in Japan.

In addition to the above, AIG also has subsidiary operations in
Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, and
conducts life insurance business through a joint venture in
Brazil and through an AIUO subsidiary company in Russia, and in
certain countries in Central and South America.

The Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services
companies have over 270,000 full and part-time agents, as well
as independent producers, and sell their products largely to
indigenous persons in local and foreign currencies. In addition
to the agency outlets, these companies also distribute their
products through direct marketing channels, such as mass
marketing, and through brokers and other distribution outlets,
such as financial institutions.

Insurance Investment

AIG’s worldwide insurance investment policy places primary
emphasis on investments in government and other high quality,
fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a
lesser extent, investments in high yield bonds, common stocks,
real estate, hedge funds and partnerships, in order to enhance
returns on policyholders’ funds and generate net investment
income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited
in certain territories as there may be a lack of adequate
long-term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed
by the local regulatory authorities. See also Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

Financial Services Operations

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified
activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium
financing.

AIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations
of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new
and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign
airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of
commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for
financial institutions. See also Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Capital Markets operations of AIG are conducted primarily
through AIGFP, which engages as principal in standard and
customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy
and credit products with top-tier corporations, financial
institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors,
and high-net-worth individuals throughout the world. AIGFP also
raises funds through municipal reinvestment contracts and other
private and public security offerings, investing the proceeds in
a diversified portfolio of high grade securities and derivative
transactions. See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Consumer Finance operations include AGF as well as AIG Consumer
Finance Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). AGF provides a wide variety of
consumer finance products, including real estate mortgages,
consumer loans, retail sales finance and credit-related
insurance to customers in the United States. AIGCFG, through its
subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi-product consumer
finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets. See also
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Together, the Aircraft Finance, Capital Markets and Consumer
Finance operations generate the vast majority of the revenues
produced by AIG’s consolidated Financial Services
operations.

Imperial A.I. Credit Companies also contribute to Financial
Services income. This operation engages principally in insurance
premium financing for both AIG’s customers and those of
other insurers. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Asset Management Operations

AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety
of investment-related services and investment products,
including institutional and retail asset management, broker
dealer services and spread-based investment business from the
sale of guaranteed investment contracts, also known as funding
agreements (GICs). Such products and services are offered to
individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas.

AIG’s principal Asset Management operations are conducted
through certain subsidiaries of AIG Retirement Services, Inc.
(AIG SunAmerica), including SAAMCo and the AIG Advisor Group
broker dealers and AIG Global Investment Group. AIG SunAmerica
sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial advisory
services through independent-contractor registered
representatives. AIG Global Investment Group manages invested
assets on a global basis for third-party institutional, retail,
private equity and real estate investment funds, provides
securities lending and custodial services and organizes and
manages the invested assets of institutional private equity
investment funds. Each of these subsidiary operations receives
fees for investment products and services provided. See also
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Other Operations

Certain other AIG subsidiaries provide insurance-related
services such as adjusting claims and marketing specialized
products. Several wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of AIG
operating in countries or jurisdictions such as Ireland,
Bermuda, Barbados and Gibraltar provide insurance and related
administrative and back office services to a variety of
insurance and reinsurance companies. These companies include
captive insurance companies unaffiliated with AIG, subsidiaries
of AIG and the subsidiaries of holding companies in which AIG
holds an interest, such as IPC Holdings, Ltd (IPC) and Allied
World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. (AWAC). AIG also has several
other subsidiaries which engage in various businesses. Mt.
Mansfield Company, Inc. owns and operates the ski slopes, lifts,
school and an inn located at Stowe, Vermont. Also included in
other operations are unallocated corporate expenses, including
the settlement costs more fully described in
Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 12(i) of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additional Investments

AIG holds a 24.3 percent interest in IPC, a reinsurance
holding company, a 23.4 percent interest in AWAC, a
property-casualty insurance holding company, and a
24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance
Co., Ltd., a general insurance company. See also Note 1(s)
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Locations of Certain Assets

As of December 31, 2005, approximately 34 percent of
the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries
(other than Canada), including $4.4 billion of cash and
securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities.
Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely
affected by political developments in foreign countries,
including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization,
and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of
hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their
overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot
easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does
occur, AIG’s policy is to take all appropriate measures to
seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which
AIG’s business is conducted have currency restrictions
which generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to
repatriate assets and profits. See also Notes 1 and 2 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Risk
Factors — Foreign Operations” in Item 1A.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Regulation

AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation
by many different types of regulatory authorities, including
insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift
regulators in the United States and abroad. The regulatory
environment can have a significant effect on AIG and its
business. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and
consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory
supervision and the possibility of intervention. In addition,
the investigations into financial accounting practices that led
to the Restatements of AIG’s financial statements have
heightened regulatory scrutiny of AIG worldwide.

Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by
insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are
controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation
typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the
corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other
companies in the holding company system and prior approval of
intercorporate services and transfers of assets (including in
some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary)
within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are
registered under such legislation in those states that have such
requirements. See also Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other
insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the
states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business.
Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies
but generally has its source in statutes that delegate
regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The
regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of
policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be
met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements,
the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and
limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks
that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of
securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for
acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the
affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports
of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for
unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such
regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than
the equity owners of these companies. See also Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

In connection with the Restatements, AIG undertook to examine
and evaluate each of the items that have been restated or
adjusted in its consolidated GAAP financial statements to
determine whether restatement of the previously filed statutory
financial statements of its insurance company subsidiaries would
be required. AIG completed its 2004 audited statutory financial
statements for all of the Domestic General Insurance companies
in late 2005. The statutory accounting treatment of the various
items requiring adjustment or restatement were reviewed and
agreed to with the relevant state insurance regulators in
advance of the filings. Adjustments necessary to reflect the
cumulative effect on statutory surplus of adjustments relating
to years prior to 2004 were made to 2004 opening surplus, and
2004 statutory net income was restated accordingly. Previously
reported General Insurance statutory surplus at
December 31, 2004 was reduced by approximately
$3.5 billion to approximately $20.6 billion.

AIG also recently completed its 2005 unaudited statutory
financial statements for all of the Domestic General Insurance
companies, again after reviewing and agreeing with the relevant
state insurance regulators the statutory accounting treatment of
various items. The state regulators have permitted the Domestic
General Insurance companies to record a $724 million
reduction to opening statutory surplus as of January 1,
2005, to reflect the effects of the Second Restatement. See also
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — “Capital
Resources — Regulation and Supervision” herein.

AIG has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of
the Domestic General Insurance companies. AIG entered into
capital maintenance agreements with the Domestic General
Insurance companies that set forth procedures through which AIG
will provide ongoing capital support. Dividends from the
Domestic General Insurance companies were suspended in the
fourth quarter of 2005. AIG contributed an additional
$750 million of capital into American Home effective
September 30, 2005, and contributed a further
$2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of
approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General
Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005.
Furthermore, in order to allow the Domestic General Insurance
companies to record as an admitted asset at December 31,
2005 certain reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers (which has
the effect of increasing the statutory surplus of such Domestic
General Insurance companies), AIG has obtained, and entered into
reimbursement agreements for $1.5 billion of letters of
credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain
Domestic General Insurance companies.

AIG’s insurance operations are currently under review by
various state regulatory agencies. See Item 3. Legal
Proceedings for a further description of these investigations
and see “Risk Factors – Regulatory
Investigations” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for more
information on their application to AIG’s insurance
businesses.

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of
an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks
inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general
and life insurance companies may be identified.

The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of
statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset,
premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more
risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items.
Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a
result of the insurer’s size, but also on the risk profile
of the insurer’s operations.

The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of
regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the
calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in
severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for

corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory
control.

The statutory surplus of each of AIG’s domestic general and
life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards as of
December 31, 2005.

To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would
fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG’s
intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity.

A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business
and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in
foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in
foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the
underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must
satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by
foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to
modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other
AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in
certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In
the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to
conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions.

In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign
operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with
respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type
of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and
type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned
to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign
countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain
countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or
partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are
obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which may
not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full
compensation. In some countries, regulations governing
constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may
hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

In 1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company when the
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to
organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. Annually, the OTS conducts an
examination of AIG. The OTS examination involves assessing the
organization’s overall risk profile.

Competition

AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management
businesses operate in a highly competitive environment, both
domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are
insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank
financial institutions.

The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive.
Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance
subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,100 other stock
companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies
and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries
offering Life Insurance and Retirement Services compete in the
United States with approximately 2,000 life insurance companies
and other participants in related financial services fields.
Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign
insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers, global
insurance groups, and local companies in particular areas in
which they are active.

AIG’s strong ratings have historically provided a
competitive advantage. The effect on the business of AIG of
recent regulatory investigations, the Restatements, and
subsequent ratings actions is currently unknown, but these
developments may adversely affect the competitive position of
AIG and its subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors — AIG
Credit Ratings” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

AIG’s Credit Ratings

The downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings will increase
AIG’s borrowing costs, may lessen AIG’s ability to
compete in certain businesses and will require AIG to post
additional collateral.

From March through June of 2005, the major rating agencies
downgraded AIG’s ratings in a series of actions. Standard
& Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
(S&P), lowered the long-term senior debt and counterparty
ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and
changed the rating outlook to negative. Moody’s Investors
Service (Moody’s) lowered AIG’s long-term senior debt
rating from ‘Aaa’ to ‘Aa2’ and changed the
outlook to stable. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the
long-term senior debt ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to
‘AA’ and placed the ratings on Rating Watch Negative.

The agencies also took rating actions on AIG’s insurance
subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to ‘AA+’ the
insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIG’s
insurance companies. Moody’s lowered the insurance
financial strength ratings generally to either ‘Aa1’
or ‘Aa2’. A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength
ratings for most of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries from
‘A++’ to ‘A+’ and the issuer credit ratings
from ‘aa+’ to ‘aa-’. Many of these
companies’ ratings remain on a negative watch.

In addition, S&P changed the outlook on ILFC’s
‘AA-’ long-term senior debt rating to negative.
Moody’s affirmed ILFC’s long-term and short-term
senior debt ratings

(‘A1’/‘P-1’).

Fitch downgraded ILFC’s long-term senior debt rating from
‘AA-’ to ‘A+’ and placed the rating on
Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFC’s short-term debt
rating from ‘F1+’ to ‘F1’. Fitch also placed
the ‘A+’ long-term senior debt ratings of American
General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc.
on Rating Watch Negative. S&P and Moody’s affirmed the
long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of American General
Finance Corporation at

‘A+’/‘A-1’

and

‘A1’/‘P-1’,

respectively.

These debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions
of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended
or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other
circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG
management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a
complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

These ratings actions have affected and will continue to affect
AIG’s business and results of operations in a number of
ways.

-

Downgrades in AIG’s debt
    ratings will adversely affect AIG’s results of
    operations.

AIG
    relies on external sources of financing to fund several of its
    operations. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are
    generally dependent on the issuer’s long-term and
    short-term debt ratings. These downgrades and any future
    downgrades in AIG’s debt ratings may adversely affect
    AIG’s borrowing costs and therefore adversely affect
    AIG’s results of operations.

-

The downgrade in AIG’s
    long-term senior debt ratings will adversely affect AIGFP’s
    ability to compete for certain
    businesses.

Credit
    ratings are very important to the ability of financial
    institutions to compete in the derivative and structured
    transaction marketplaces. Historically, AIG’s triple-A
    ratings provided AIGFP a competitive advantage. The downgrades
    have reduced this advantage and, for specialized financial
    transactions that generally are conducted only by triple-A rated
    financial institutions, counterparties may be unwilling to
    transact business with AIGFP except on a secured basis. This
    could require AIGFP to post more collateral to counterparties in
    the future. See below for a further discussion of the effect
    that posting collateral may have on AIG’s liquidity.

-

Although the financial strength
    ratings of AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries remain high
    compared to many of their competitors, the downgrades have
    reduced the previous ratings
    differential.

The
    competitive advantage of the ratings to AIG’s insurance
    company subsidiaries may be lessened accordingly.

-

As a result of the downgrades
    of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIG was required to
    post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with
    counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and
    financial derivatives
    transactions.

In
    the event of a further downgrade, AIG will be required to post
    additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of
    business on February 28, 2006 based on AIG’s
    outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements and
    financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further
    downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to
    ‘Aa3’ by Moody’s or ‘AA-’ by S&P
    would permit counterparties to call for approximately
    $962 million of additional collateral. Further, additional
    downgrades could result in requirements for substantial
    additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how
    AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional
    collateral that AIG would be required to post to counterparties
    in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions,
    the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and
    other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. Any
    additional obligations to post collateral will increase the
    demand on AIG’s liquidity.

Regulatory Investigations

Significant legal proceedings have adversely affected
AIG’s results of operations for 2005.

As a result of
the settlements discussed below under Item 3. Legal
Proceedings, AIG recorded an after-tax charge of approximately
$1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG is party
to numerous other legal proceedings and regulatory
investigations. It is possible that the effect of the unresolved
matters could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for an individual reporting period. For a discussion
of these unresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Significant investigations into AIG’s business are
continuing and the commencement of additional investigations is
possible.

Broad-ranging investigations into AIG’s
business practices continue. These investigations are being
conducted by a number of regulators, and related actions by
regulators both within and outside the United States may be
undertaken in response. The review of large amounts of
information by various regulatory authorities may result in the
commencement of new areas of inquiry and, possibly, new
significant legal proceedings.

The Relationships Between AIG and Starr and SICO

The relationships between AIG and Starr and SICO may take an
extended period of time to unwind and/or resolve, and the
consequences of such resolution are uncertain.

Although AIG
is currently working on unwinding and resolving its
relationships with C.V. Starr & Co, Inc. (Starr) and Starr
International Company, Inc. (SICO), AIG cannot predict what its
future relationship with Starr and SICO will be. AIG
subsidiaries are in the process of terminating their agency
relationships with the Starr agencies and are beginning to write
the business previously produced by those agencies on a direct
basis. AIG also continues to address the issues posed by
compensation plans and programs previously provided to AIG
executives by Starr and SICO, as AIG is providing compensation
programs that recognize those plans and programs. In January
2006, Starr announced that it had completed its tender offers to
purchase interests in Starr and that all eligible shareholders
had tendered their shares. As a result of completion of the
tender offers, no AIG executive currently holds any Starr
interest. AIG has entered into agreements pursuant to which AIG
agrees, subject to certain conditions, to assure AIG’s
current employees that all payments are made under a series of
two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans
provided by SICO (SICO Plans). See Note 12(f) and
Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that AIG will be able to
effectively address the consequences for its executives of the
unwinding of their participation in the Starr and SICO plans and
programs. Nor can there be any assurance that AIG will compete
successfully for the business previously produced by the Starr
agencies.

Finally, litigation between AIG and Starr and SICO remains
pending, and the timing and terms of any resolution cannot
currently be predicted. As a result of the foregoing, there can
be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of AIG’s
relationships with Starr and SICO will not be adverse to AIG.
For further information about litigation between AIG and Starr
and SICO, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Certain Material Weaknesses

Management identified three remaining material weaknesses in
AIG’s internal control over financial reporting.

Remediation of these material weaknesses is ongoing. Until these
weaknesses are remediated, the weaknesses could affect the
accuracy or timing of future filings with the SEC and other
regulatory authorities. A discussion of these material
weaknesses and AIG’s remediation efforts can be found in
Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Access to Capital Markets

AIG’s access to the U.S. public capital markets may be
delayed by the SEC registration process.

Although AIG is
able to access the Rule 144A and Euro markets, AIG will be
unable to access the U.S. public securities markets until
it has filed and the SEC has declared effective a new
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933.
Depending upon the SEC’s review of these filings, this
process may take several months or more.

Unless relief is granted by the SEC, AIG will not be able to
avail itself of certain favorable provisions of the Securities
Act.

AIG will not, for a period of three years, be a
“well-known seasoned issuer”. During this period,
AIG’s ability to communicate with respect to new product
offerings and to structure client products will be more limited
than they otherwise would. In addition, during this period, AIG
will not be able to avail itself of provisions that allow for an
automatically effective shelf registration statement or rely on
the “forward-looking statements” safe harbor under the
securities laws in providing forward-looking information to
investors.

Foreign Operations

Foreign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect its
operations, liquidity and financial conditions.

AIG provides
insurance and investment products and services to both
businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and
jurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIG’s General
Insurance business and a majority of its Life
Insurance & Retirement Services businesses are
conducted outside the United States. Operations outside of the
United States may be affected by regional economic downturns,
political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive
government actions, which could also affect other AIG operations.

The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign
jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the
underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must
satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by
foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to
modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance
subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business
in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.
AIG’s international operations include operations in
various developing nations. Both current and future foreign
operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political
developments including tax changes, regulatory restrictions and
nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation.
Adverse affects resulting from any one country may affect
AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s
net financial exposure at that time in that country.

Liquidity

Payments from subsidiaries may be limited by regulators.

AIG depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from
AIG’s subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund
payments on AIG’s obligations, including debt obligations.
Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit AIG’s
ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from AIG’s
subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIG’s subsidiaries,
including AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws
and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or
reduce the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that
prohibit such transfer altogether in certain circumstances.
These laws and regulations may hinder AIG’s ability to
access funds that AIG may need to make payments on AIG’s
obligations.

Regulation

AIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions
in which it conducts its businesses.

AIG’s operations
around the world are subject to regulation by different types of
regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities,
investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United
States and abroad. AIG’s operations have become more
diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of
regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In
particular, AIG’s consumer lending business is subject to a
broad array of laws and regulations governing lending practices
and permissible loan terms, and AIG would expect increased
regulatory oversight relating to this business.

The regulatory environment could have a significant effect on
AIG and its businesses. Among other things, AIG could be fined,
prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities or
subject to limitations or conditions on its business activities.
Significant regulatory action against AIG could have material
adverse financial effects, cause significant reputational harm,
or harm business prospects. New laws or regulations or changes
in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to
clients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses. See
Item 1. Business — “Regulation.”

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Casualty Insurance Underwriting and Reserves

Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict
and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss
expenses.

Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of
the established reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can
be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not
develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s current loss
reserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and
loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines
of business, which include excess and umbrella liability,
D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers
compensation, general liability, products liability and related
classes, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures.
Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used
to project future loss development. However, there can be no
assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same
as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or
in loss development factors might not be discernible for an
extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the
initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus,
there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of
years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost
trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in
setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss
development factors could be attributable to changes in
inflation in labor and material costs or in the judicial
environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting
claims. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Operating Review — Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses.”

Natural Disasters and Pandemic Diseases

Natural disasters and pandemic disease could adversely affect
AIG’s operating results.

Natural disasters such as
hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the
potential to adversely affect AIG’s operating results.
Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, such as
the Avian Influenza A Virus (H5N1), could adversely affect
AIG’s business and operating results to an extent that may
be only minimally offset by reinsurance programs.

While to date outbreaks of the Avian Flu continue to occur among
poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in Asia, parts of
Europe, and recently in Africa, transmission to humans has been
rare. If the virus mutates to a form that can be transmitted
from human to human, it has the potential to spread rapidly
worldwide. If such an outbreak were to take place, early
quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment.

Both the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated H5N1 virus
that can be transmitted from human to human are highly
speculative. AIG continues to monitor the developing facts. A
significant global outbreak could have a material adverse effect
on AIG’s life insurance business operating results and
liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates.

ITEM 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

There are no material unresolved written comments that were
received from the SEC staff 180 days or more before the end
of AIG’s fiscal year relating to AIG’s periodic or
current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act).

ITEM 2.

ITEM 3.

Legal Proceedings

General

AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry
in general, are subject to litigation, including claims for
punitive damages, in the normal course of their business. See
Notes 12(d), 12(g), 12(h) and 12(i) of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the Discussion and
Analysis of Consolidated Net Losses and Loss Expense Reserve
Development and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

2006 Regulatory Settlements

In February 2006, AIG reached a final settlement with the SEC,
the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of the
New York Attorney General (NYAG) and the New York State
Department of Insurance (DOI). The settlements resolved
outstanding litigation filed by the SEC, NYAG and DOI against
AIG and concluded negotiations with these authorities and the
DOJ in connection with the accounting, financial reporting and
insurance brokerage practices of AIG and its subsidiaries, as
well as claims relating to the underpayment of certain workers
compensation premium taxes and other assessments. The 2005
financial statements included in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K

include
a fourth quarter after-tax charge of $1.15 billion
recording the settlements.

As part of the settlement with the SEC, the SEC filed a civil
complaint, alleging that from 2000 until 2005, AIG materially
falsified its financial statements through a variety of
transactions and entities in order to strengthen the appearance
of its financial results to analysts and investors.

AIG

-

Form

10-K


AIG, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC
complaint, consented to the issuance of a final judgment on
February 9, 2006: (a) permanently restraining and
enjoining AIG from violating Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Sections 10(b),
13(a), 13(b)(2) and 13(b)(5) and
Rules

10b-5,

12b-20,

13a-1,

and

of the Exchange
Act; (b) ordering AIG to pay disgorgement in the amount of
$700 million; and (c) ordering AIG to pay a civil
penalty in the amount of $100 million. These amounts have
been paid into a fund under the supervision of the SEC to be
available to resolve claims asserted in various civil
proceedings, including shareholder lawsuits.

In February 2006, AIG and the DOJ entered into a letter
agreement. In the letter agreement, the DOJ notified AIG that in
its view, AIG, acting through some of its employees, violated
federal criminal law in connection with misstatements in
periodic financial reports that AIG filed with the SEC between
2000 and 2004 relating to certain transactions. The settlement
with the DOJ consists of, among other things, AIG’s
cooperating with the DOJ in the DOJ’s ongoing criminal
investigation, accepting responsibility for certain of its
actions and those of its employees relating to these
transactions and paying $25 million.

Effective February 9, 2006, AIG entered into agreements
with the NYAG and the DOI, settling claims under New York’s
Martin Act and insurance laws, among other provisions, which
were originally brought by the NYAG and the DOI in a civil
complaint filed on May 26, 2005. Under the agreements,
$375 million was paid into a fund under the supervision of
the NYAG and the DOI to be available principally to pay certain
AIG insureds who purchased excess casualty policies through
Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. or Marsh Inc. In
addition, approximately $343 million will be used to
compensate participating state funds in connection with the
underpayment of certain workers compensation premium taxes and
other assessments. In addition, AIG paid $100 million as a
fine to the State of New York.

As part of these settlements, AIG has agreed to retain for a
period of three years an independent consultant who will conduct
a review that will include the adequacy of AIG’s internal
controls over financial reporting and the remediation plan that
AIG has implemented as a result of its own internal review.

PNC Settlement

In November 2004, AIG and AIGFP reached a final settlement with
the SEC, the Fraud Section of the DOJ and the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana with respect to
issues arising from certain structured transactions entered into
with Brightpoint, Inc. and The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc. (PNC), the marketing of transactions similar to the PNC
transactions and related matters.

As part of the settlement, the SEC filed against AIG a civil
complaint, based on the conduct of AIG primarily through AIGFP,
alleging violations of certain antifraud provisions of the
federal securities laws and for aiding and abetting violations
of reporting and record keeping provisions of those laws. AIG,
without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC
complaint, consented to the issuance of a final judgment
permanently enjoining it and its employees and related persons
from violating certain provisions of the Exchange Act, Exchange
Act Rules and the Securities Act, ordering disgorgement of fees
it received in the PNC transactions and providing for AIG to
establish a transaction review committee to review the
appropriateness of certain future transactions and to retain an
independent consultant to examine certain transactions entered
into between 2000 and 2004 and review the policies and
procedures of the transaction review committee. The independent
consultant has a broad mandate to review transactions entered
into by AIG during this period. The review of the independent
consultant is now ongoing and AIG cannot at this time predict
the outcome of this review.

The DOJ filed against AIGFP PAGIC Equity Holding Corp. (AIGFP
PAGIC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIGFP, a criminal complaint
alleging that AIGFP PAGIC violated federal securities laws by
aiding and abetting securities law violations by PNC, in
connection with a transaction entered into in 2001 with PNC that
was intended to enable PNC to remove certain assets from its
balance sheet.

The settlement with the DOJ consists of separate agreements with
AIG and AIGFP and a complaint filed against, and deferred
prosecution agreement with, AIGFP PAGIC. Under the terms of the
settlement, AIGFP paid a monetary penalty of $80 million.
On January 17, 2006, the court approved an order dismissing
the complaint with prejudice. The obligations of AIG, AIGFP and
AIGFP PAGIC under the DOJ agreements relate principally to
cooperating with the DOJ and other federal agencies in
connection with their related investigations.

Investigations of Insurance Practices

Regulators from several states have commenced investigations
into insurance brokerage practices related to contingent
commissions and other broker-related conduct, such as alleged
bid rigging. Various parties, including insureds and
shareholders, have also asserted putative class action and other
claims against AIG or its subsidiaries alleging, among other
things, violations of the antitrust and federal securities laws,
and AIG expects that additional claims may be made. Pursuant to
the settlements with the NYAG and the DOI, $375 million was
paid into a fund under the supervision of the NYAG and the DOI
to be available principally to pay certain AIG insureds who
purchased excess casualty policies through Marsh Inc. In
addition, approximately $343 million will be used to
compensate participating states in connection with the
underpayment of certain workers compensation premium taxes and
other assessments. It is likely that many of the claims arising
from state investigations, as well as claims made by insureds,
will be settled using these funds.

Various federal and state regulatory agencies are reviewing
certain other transactions and practices of AIG and its
subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other
inquiries. AIG has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate,
with all these investigations, including by producing documents
and other information in response to the subpoenas.

Pending Litigation

A number of lawsuits have been filed regarding the subject
matter of the investigations of insurance brokerage practices,
including derivative actions, individual actions and class
actions under the federal securities laws, Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and state common and
corporate laws in both federal and state courts, including the
federal district court in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York (Southern District of New
York), in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court and
in the Delaware Chancery Court. All of these actions generally
allege that AIG and its subsidiaries violated the law by
allegedly concealing a scheme to “rig bids” and
“steer” business between insurance companies and
insurance brokers.

Since October 19, 2004, AIG or its subsidiaries have been
named as a defendant in fifteen complaints that were filed in
federal court and two that were originally filed in state court
(Massachusetts and Florida) and removed to federal court. These
cases generally allege that AIG and its subsidiaries violated
federal and various state antitrust laws, as well as federal
RICO laws, various state deceptive and unfair practice laws and
certain state laws governing fiduciary duties. The alleged basis
of these claims is that there was a conspiracy between insurance
companies and insurance brokers with regard to the use of
contingent commission agreements, bidding practices, and other
broker-related conduct concerning coverage in certain sectors of
the insurance industry. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation entered an order on February 17, 2005,
consolidating most of these cases and transferring them to the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
(District of New Jersey). The remainder of these cases have been
transferred to the District of New Jersey. On August 15,
2005, the plaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation filed a
Corrected First Consolidated Amended Commercial
Class Action Complaint, which, in addition to the
previously named AIG defendants, names new AIG subsidiaries as
defendants. Also on August 15, 2005, AIG and two
subsidiaries were named as defendants in a Corrected First
Consolidated Amended Employee Benefits Class Action Complaint
filed in the District Court of New Jersey, which asserts similar
claims with respect to employee benefits insurance and a claim
under ERISA on behalf of putative classes of employers and
employees. On November 29, 2005, the AIG defendants, along
with other insurer defendants and the broker defendants filed
motions to dismiss both the Commercial and Employee Benefits
Complaints. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class
certification in the consolidated action. In addition,
complaints were filed against AIG and several of its
subsidiaries in Massachusetts and Florida state courts, which
have both been stayed. In the Florida action, the plaintiff has
filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the District
Court of Appeals of the State of Florida, Fourth District with
respect to the stay order. On February 9, 2006, a complaint
against AIG and several of its subsidiaries was filed in Texas
state court, making claims similar to those in the federal cases
above.

In April and May 2005, amended complaints were filed in the
consolidated derivative and securities cases, as well as in one
of the ERISA lawsuits, pending in the Southern District of New
York adding allegations concerning AIG’s accounting
treatment for non-traditional insurance products. In September
2005, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated
securities cases adding allegations concerning AIG’s First
Restatement. Also in September 2005, a new securities action
complaint was filed in the Southern District of New York,
asserting claims premised on the same allegations made in the
consolidated cases. Motions to dismiss have been filed in the
securities actions. In September 2005, a consolidated complaint
was filed in the ERISA case pending in the Southern District of
New York. Motions to dismiss have been filed in that ERISA case.
Also in April 2005, new derivative actions were filed in the
Delaware Chancery Court, and in July and August 2005, two new
derivative actions were filed in the Southern District of New
York asserting claims duplicative of the claims made in the
consolidated derivative action.

In July 2005, a second amended complaint was filed in the
consolidated derivative case in the Southern District of New
York, expanding upon accounting-related allegations based upon
AIG’s First Restatement and, in August 2005, an amended
consolidated complaint was filed. In June 2005, the derivative
cases in Delaware were consolidated. AIG’s Board of
Directors has appointed a special committee of independent
directors to review the matters asserted in the derivative
complaints. The courts have approved agreements staying the
derivative cases pending in the Southern District of New York
and in the Delaware Chancery Court while the special committee
of independent directors performs its work. In September 2005, a
shareholder filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking
documents relating to some of the allegations made in the
derivative suits. AIG filed a motion to dismiss in October 2005.

In late 2002, a derivative action was filed in the Delaware
Chancery Court in connection with AIG’s transactions with
certain entities affiliated with Starr and SICO. In May 2005,
the plaintiff filed an amended complaint which adds additional
claims premised on allegations relating to insurance brokerage
practices and AIG’s non-traditional insurance products.
Plaintiffs in that case have agreed to dismiss newly added
allegations unrelated to transactions with entities affiliated
with Starr and SICO without prejudice to pursuit of these claims
in the separate derivative actions described above. On
February 16, 2006, the Delaware Chancery Court entered an
order dismissing the litigation with prejudice with respect to
AIG’s outside directors and dismissing the claims against
the remaining AIG defendants without prejudice.

On July 8, 2005, SICO filed a complaint against AIG in the
Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that AIG is
in the possession of items, including artwork, which SICO claims
it owns, and seeks an order causing AIG to release those items
as well as actual, consequential, punitive and exemplary
damages. On September 27, 2005, AIG filed its answer to
SICO’s complaint denying SICO’s allegations and
asserting counter-claims for breach of contract, unjust
enrichment, conversion and breach of fiduciary duty relating to

AIG

SICO’s breach of its commitment to use its AIG shares for
the benefit of AIG and its employees. On October 17, 2005,
SICO replied to AIG’s counter-claims and additionally
sought a judgment declaring that SICO is neither a control
person nor an affiliate of AIG for the purposes of
Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act, and Rule 144
under the Securities Act, respectively. AIG responded to the
SICO claims on November 7, 2005.

Effect on AIG

In the opinion of AIG management, AIG’s ultimate liability
for the unresolved matters referred to above is not likely to
have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated
financial condition, although it is possible that the effect
would be material to AIG’s consolidated results of
operations for an individual reporting period.

ITEM 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG presents its
operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful.
Statutory underwriting profit (loss) and combined ratios
are presented in accordance with accounting principles
prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are
standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry
and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s
insurance competitors. AIG has also incorporated into this
discussion a number of cross-references to additional
information included throughout this Annual Report on Form

10-K

to assist readers
seeking related information on a particular subject.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is
designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to
AIG’s operations, financial condition and liquidity and
certain other significant matters.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Continued

Overview of Operations and Business
Results

In 2003 and prior years, AIG’s operations were conducted by
its subsidiaries principally through four operating
segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services
and Retirement Services & Asset Management. Beginning
with the first quarter of 2004, AIG reports Retirement Services
results in the same segment as Life Insurance, reflecting the
convergence of protective financial and retirement products and
AIG’s current management of these operations. All financial
information herein gives effect to the Restatements described in
“The Restatements” under Item 1. Business.
Information for years prior to 2005 included herein has been
reclassified to show AIG’s results of operations and
financial position on a comparable basis with the 2005
presentation.

Through these segments, AIG provides insurance and investment
products and services to both businesses and individuals in more
than 130 countries and jurisdictions. This geographic,
product and service diversification is one of AIG’s major
strengths and sets it apart from its competitors. The importance
of this diversification was especially evident in 2005, when
record catastrophe losses, settlements of legal proceedings and
charges for increases in reserves for loss and loss expenses,
were more than offset by profitability in other segments and
product lines. Although regional economic downturns or political
upheaval could negatively affect parts of AIG’s operations,
AIG believes that its diversification makes it unlikely that
regional difficulties would have a material effect on its
operating results, financial condition or liquidity.

AIG’s subsidiaries serve commercial, institutional and
individual customers through an extensive

property-casualty

and
life insurance and retirement services network. In the United
States, AIG companies are the largest underwriters of commercial
and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance
and retirement services operations as well. AIG’s Financial
Services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment
leasing, capital markets operations and consumer finance, both
in the United States and abroad. AIG also provides asset
management services and offers guaranteed investment contracts
(GICs) to institutions and individuals.

A primary goal of AIG in managing its General Insurance
operations is to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve this
goal, AIG must be disciplined in its risk selection and premiums
must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover
the risk accepted. AIG believes in strict control of expenses.

AIG’s 2005 operating performance reflects continuing
implementation of various long-term strategies in its various
operating segments.

A central focus of AIG operations in recent years is the
development and expansion of new distribution channels. In 2005,
AIG continued to expand its distribution channels in many Asian
countries, which now include banks, credit card companies and
television-media home shopping. In late 2003, AIG entered into
an agreement with PICC Property and Casualty Company, Limited
(PICC), which will enable the marketing of accident and health
products throughout China through PICC’s branch networks
and agency system. AIG participates in the underwriting results
through a reinsurance agreement and also holds a
9.9 percent ownership interest in PICC. Other examples of
new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas
include banks, affinity groups, direct response and e-commerce.

AIG patiently builds relationships in markets around the world
where it sees long-term growth opportunities. For example, the
fact that AIG has the only wholly-owned foreign life insurance
operations in eight cities in China is the result of
relationships developed over nearly 30 years. AIG’s more
recent expansion of operations into India, Vietnam, Russia and
other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy.
Moreover, AIG believes in investing in the economies and
infrastructures of these countries and growing with them. When
AIG companies enter a new jurisdiction, they typically offer
both basic protection and savings products. As the economies
evolve, AIG’s products evolve with them, to more complex
and investment-oriented models.

Growth for AIG may be generated both internally and through
acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer
adequate return on investment. In recent years, the acquisitions
of AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life have broadened AIG’s
penetration of the Japanese market through new distribution
channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are
integrated into AIG’s previously existing companies
operating in Japan.

AIG provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and
local economies as well as the insurance and financial services
industries. In recent years, efforts to reform the tort system
and class action litigation procedures, legislation to deal with
the asbestos problem and the renewal of the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Act have been key issues, while in prior years trade
legislation and Superfund had been issues of concern.

The following table summarizes
AIG’s revenues, income before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes and net
income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003:

Consolidated Results

The 12 percent growth in revenues in 2005 and
23 percent growth in revenues in 2004 were primarily
attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global
General Insurance operations as well as growth in both General
Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services net
investment income and Life Insurance & Retirement
Services GAAP premiums. An additional factor was the capital
gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized
in 2003.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

AIG’s income before income taxes, minority interest and
cumulative effect of accounting changes increased 2 percent
in 2005 when compared to 2004 and 25 percent in 2004 when
compared to 2003. Life Insurance & Retirement Services,
Financial Services and Asset Management operating income gains
accounted for the increase over 2004 and 2003 in both pretax
income and net income. Somewhat offsetting these gains in 2005
was the effect of the charges related to regulatory settlements,
as described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

The following table summarizes the net
effect of catastrophe losses for December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003.

Includes the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify
    for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the
    related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2005, 2004 and
    2003, the effect was $(34) million, $(27) million and
    $49 million, respectively, in operating income for Aircraft

    catastrophe related losses from partially owned companies in
    2005 and 2004, respectively, and approximately $1.6 billion
    of regulatory settlement charges in 2005.

General Insurance

AIG’s General Insurance operations provide property and
casualty products and services throughout the world. The
decrease in General Insurance operating income in 2005 compared
to 2004 was primarily attributable to catastrophe related
losses, increases in the reserve for losses and loss expenses
and changes in estimates related to the remediation of
AIG’s material weakness in control over certain balance
sheet reconciliations, partially offset by profitable growth in
Foreign General’s underwriting results and DBG’s and
Foreign General’s net investment income. In addition,
realized capital gains increased in 2005 compared to 2004.
General Insurance operating income includes $2.89 billion,
$1.05 billion and $83 million in catastrophe related
losses in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. DBG’s
operating income included $197 million of additional losses
in 2005 resulting from increased labor and material costs
related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes.

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services

AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services
operations provide insurance, financial and investment products
throughout the world. Foreign operations provided approximately
59 percent and 61 percent of AIG’s Life
Insurance & Retirement Services operating income in
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income
increased 12 percent in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004
when compared to 2003. Foreign Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operating income grew 8 percent in
2005. Realized capital gains included in operating income was
$84 million in 2005 compared to $372 million in 2004
and $486 million in 2003. The decline in realized capital
gains in 2005 includes the effect of hedging activities that do
not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133, including
the related foreign exchange gains and losses under FAS 52.
For 2005, the foreign Life & Retirement Service segment
also incurred higher policy benefit costs for contributions to
the participating policyholder fund in Singapore, totaling
$137 million related to the settlement of a long disputed
local tax issue. The domestic Life Insurance &
Retirement Services segment operating income grew by
17 percent in 2005. Realized capital losses included in
operating income was $(302) million in 2005 compared to
$(329) million in 2004 and $(246) million in 2003. The
2004 results include increased policy benefits of
$178 million associated with the workers compensation
arbitration with Superior National. The domestic Life

Operations

Continued

Services segment also includes $12 million and
$5 million in catastrophe related losses in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Financial Services

AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified
activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium
financing.

Financial Services operating income increased significantly in
2005 compared to 2004 and in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily
due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from not qualifying
for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133. Offsetting
this increase in 2004 when compared to 2003 is the effect of
ILFC’s disposition of approximately $2 billion in
aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003
and the first quarter of 2004. Fluctuations in revenues and
operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because
of the transaction-oriented nature of Capital Markets operations
and the effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment
under FAS 133 for hedges on securities available for sale
and borrowings. The increase in 2005 when compared to 2004 was
partially offset by $62 million in catastrophe related
losses in the Consumer Finance operations in 2005. The charge
relating to the PNC settlement, see Item 3. Legal
Proceedings, had a significant negative effect on results in
2004. Consumer Finance operations increased revenues and
operating income, both domestically and internationally.

Asset Management

AIG’s Asset Management operations include institutional and
retail asset management and broker dealer services and
spread-based investment business from the sale of GICs. These
products and services are offered to individuals and
institutions, both domestically and overseas.

Asset Management operating income increased 6 percent in
2005 when compared to 2004 as a result of the upturn in
worldwide financial markets and a strong global product
portfolio; operating income also increased 61 percent in
2004 when compared to 2003 as a result of the same factors.

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2005, AIG had total consolidated
shareholders’ equity of $86.32 billion and total
consolidated borrowings of $109.85 billion. At that date,
$99.42 billion of such borrowings were either not
guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations
of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), liabilities
connected to trust preferred stock, or matched notes and bonds
payable.

During 2005, AIG repurchased in the open market
2,477,100 shares of its common stock.

Liquidity

At December 31, 2005, AIG’s consolidated invested
assets included $17.24 billion in cash and short-term
investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating
activities in 2005 amounted to $25.14 billion. AIG believes
that its liquid assets, cash provided by operations and access
to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit
facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash
requirements.

Outlook

From March through June of 2005, the major rating agencies
downgraded AIG’s ratings in a series of actions. S&P
lowered the long-term senior debt and counterparty ratings of
AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and changed the
rating outlook to negative. Moody’s lowered AIG’s
long-term senior debt rating from ‘Aaa’ to
‘Aa2’ and changed the outlook to stable. Fitch
downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of AIG from
‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and placed the ratings on
Rating Watch Negative.

The agencies also took rating actions on AIG’s insurance
subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to ‘AA+’ the
insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIG’s
insurance companies. Moody’s lowered the insurance
financial strength ratings generally to either ‘Aa1’
or ‘Aa2’. A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength
ratings for most of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries from
‘A++’ to ‘A+’ and the issuer credit ratings
from ‘aa+’ to ‘aa-’. Many of these
companies’ ratings remain on a negative watch.

In addition, S&P changed the outlook on ILFC’s
‘AA-’ long-term senior debt rating to negative.
Moody’s affirmed ILFC’s long-term and short-term
senior debt ratings

(‘A1’/‘P-1’).

Fitch downgraded ILFC’s long-term senior debt rating from
‘AA-’ to ‘A+’ and placed the rating on
Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFC’s short-term debt
rating from ‘F1+’ to ‘F1’. Fitch also placed
the ‘A+’ long-term senior debt ratings of American
General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc.
on Rating Watch Negative. S&P and Moody’s affirmed the
long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of American General
Finance Corporation at

‘A+’/‘A-1’

and

‘A1’/‘P-1’,

respectively.

These debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions
of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended
or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of
changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other
circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG
management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a
complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries. For a
discussion of the effect of these ratings downgrades on
AIG’s businesses, see “Risk Factors —
AIG’s Credit Ratings” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Despite industry price erosion in some classes of general
insurance, AIG expects to continue to identify profitable
opportunities and build attractive new General Insurance
businesses as a result of AIG’s broad product line and
extensive distribution networks. In December 2005, AIUO received
a license from the government of Vietnam to operate a wholly
owned general insurance company in Vietnam. This license, the
first general insurance license granted by Vietnam to a
U.S.-based insurance organization, permits AIG to operate a
general insurance company throughout Vietnam. In early 2006, AIG
announced plans to acquire a leading general insurance company
in Taiwan.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

In China, AIG has wholly-owned life insurance operations in
eight cities. These operations should benefit from China’s
rapid rate of economic growth and growing middle class, a
segment that is a prime market for life insurance. AIG believes
that it may also have opportunities in the future to grow by
entering the group insurance business. However, in March 2005 it
withdrew its application to serve the group insurance market
until certain regulatory issues are resolved. Among the
regulatory issues to be addressed is the response to AIG’s
acknowledgment that certain of its Hong Kong based agents sold
life insurance to customers on the Chinese mainland in
contravention of applicable regulations.

AIG Edison Life, acquired in August 2003, adds to the current
agency force in Japan, and provides alternative distribution
channels including banks, financial advisers, and corporate and
government employee relationships. In January 2005, AIG Star
Life entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi, one of Japan’s largest banks, to market a
multi-currency fixed annuity. Through ALICO, AIG Star Life and
AIG Edison, AIG has developed a leadership position in the
distribution of annuities through banks. AIG is also a leader in
the direct marketing of insurance products through sponsors and
in the broad market. AIG also expects continued growth in India,
Korea and Vietnam.

Domestically, AIG anticipates continued operating growth in 2006
as distribution channels are expanded and new products are
introduced. The home service operation has not met business
objectives, although its cash flow has been strong, and domestic
group life/health continues to be weak. The home service
operation is expected to be a slow growth business. AIG American
General’s current ratings remain equal to or higher than
many of its principal competitors. AIG American General competes
with a variety of companies based on services and products, in
addition to ratings. The recent rating actions appear to be
having no negative long term effect on independent producer
relationships or customer surrender activity.

In the airline industry, changes in market conditions are not
immediately apparent in operating results. Lease rates have
firmed considerably, as a result of strong demand spurred by the
recovering global commercial aviation market, especially in
Asia. Sales have begun to increase, and AIG expects an
increasing level of interest from a variety of purchasers. AIG
also expects increased contributions to Financial Services
revenues and income from its consumer finance operations
overseas. However, the downgrades of AIG’s credit ratings
may adversely affect funding costs for AIG and its subsidiaries
and AIGFP’s ability to engage in derivative transactions
and certain structured products. See “Risk
Factors – AIG’s Credit Ratings” in
Item 1A. Risk Factors.

GICs, which are sold domestically and abroad to both
institutions and individuals, are written on an opportunistic
basis when market conditions are favorable. In September 2005,
AIG launched a $10 billion matched investment program in
the Euromarkets under which AIG debt securities will be issued.
AIG also expects to launch a matched investment program in the
domestic market which, along with the Euro program, will become
AIG’s principal spread-based investment activity. However,
the timing of the launch of the domestic program is uncertain.
Because AIG’s credit spreads in the capital markets have
widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction
in the earnings on new business in AIG’s spread based
funding businesses.

AIG has many promising growth initiatives underway around the
world. Cooperative agreements such as those with PICC and
various banks in the U.S., Japan and Korea are expected to
expand distribution networks for AIG’s products and provide
models for future growth.

For a description of the risk factors that may affect these
operations and initiatives, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Critical Accounting Estimates

AIG considers its most critical accounting estimates those with
respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses, future policy
benefits for life and accident and health contracts, deferred
policy acquisition costs, estimated gross profits for
investment-oriented products, fair value determinations for
certain Capital Markets assets and liabilities,
other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments and
flight equipment recoverability. These accounting estimates
require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are
highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual
experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s results
of operations would be directly affected.

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, AIG’s
critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail. The major
categories for which assumptions are developed and used to
establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted
below.

RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES (GENERAL INSURANCE):

    latest accident
    year:

in this
    case, accident year 2005 for the year end 2005 loss reserve

(FINANCIAL SERVICES):

-

Valuation
    models:

utilizing
    factors, such as market liquidity and current interest, foreign

-

Pricing
    data:

AIG attempts
    to secure reliable and independent current market price data,
    such as published exchange rates from external subscription
    services such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker
    quotes for use in its models. When such prices are not
    available, AIG uses an internal methodology, which includes
    interpolation and extrapolation from verifiable prices from
    trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the
    transactions.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS:

Securities are considered a candidate for other-than-temporary
impairment based upon the following criteria:

-

Trading at a significant
    (25 percent or more) discount to par or amortized cost (if
    lower) for an extended period of time (nine months or longer).

-

The occurrence of a discrete
    credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking
    bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization.

-

The probability of non-realization
    of a full recovery on its investment, irrespective of the
    occurrence of one of the foregoing events.

Operating Review

General Insurance Operations

AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line
companies writing substantially all lines of property and
casualty insurance both domestically and abroad. See
“General Insurance Operations” in Item 1.
Business for more information relating to General Insurance
subsidiaries.

As previously noted, AIG believes it should present and discuss
its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its
investors. Accordingly, in its General Insurance business, AIG
uses certain non-GAAP measures, where AIG has determined these
measurements to be useful and meaningful.

A critical discipline of a successful general insurance business
is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting
exclusive of investment-related income. When underwriting is not
profitable, premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses
and underwriting related expenses. In these situations, the
addition of general insurance related investment income and
realized capital gains may, however, enable a general insurance
business to produce operating income. For these reasons, AIG
views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall
evaluation of performance. Although in and of itself not a GAAP
measurement, AIG believes that underwriting profit is a useful
and meaningful disclosure. See also the discussion under
“Liquidity” herein.

Underwriting profit is measured in two ways: statutory
underwriting profit and GAAP underwriting profit.

Statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net
premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net
expenses incurred. Statutory accounting generally requires
immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of
revenues and expenses as required by GAAP. That is, for
statutory purposes, expenses are recognized immediately, not
over the same period that the revenues are earned.

GAAP accounting requires the recognition of expenses at the same
time revenues are earned, the accounting principle of matching.
Therefore, to convert underwriting results to a GAAP basis,
acquisition expenses are deferred (deferred policy acquisition
costs (DAC)) and amortized over the period the related net
premiums written are earned. Accordingly, the statutory
underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition
expenses being deferred as required by GAAP. DAC is reviewed for
recoverability, and such review requires management judgment.
See also “Critical Accounting Estimates” herein and
Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

AIG, along with most General Insurance companies, uses the loss
ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of
underwriting performance. The loss ratio is the sum of losses
and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. The
expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net
premiums written. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss
ratio and the expense ratio. These ratios are relative
measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums
earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses,
respectively. The combined ratio presents the total

cost per $100 of premium production. A combined ratio below 100
demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100
demonstrates underwriting loss.

Net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based
upon the terms of the underlying policies. The net unearned
premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are
generally earned ratably over the policy period. Thus, the net
unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as
net premiums earned until the end of the policy period.

The underwriting environment varies from country to country, as
does the degree of litigation activity. Regulation, product type
and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently
on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and
statutory general insurance ratios.

General Insurance operating income is
comprised of underwriting profit (loss), net investment income
and realized capital gains and losses. These components, as well
as net premiums written, net premiums earned and statutory
ratios for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

(a)

The effect of catastrophe related losses on the consolidated
    General Insurance combined ratio for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
    7.06, 2.74 and 0.27, respectively. Catastrophe related losses
    for 2005, 2004 and 2003 by reporting unit were as follows:

(b)

Includes $197 million of additional losses incurred
    resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the
    2004 Florida hurricanes.

(c)

The 2005 operating loss for DBG includes $291 million of
    expenses related to changes in estimates for uncollectible
    reinsurance and other premium balances and $100 million of
    accrued expenses in connection with certain workers compensation
    insurance policies written between 1985 and 1996. See
    Note 12(i) of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

(d)

Includes the fourth quarter 2005 increase in net reserves of
    approximately $1.8 billion.

(e) Includes the results of wholly owned AIU
agencies.

(f)

Income statement accounts expressed in non-functional
    currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using average
    exchange rates.

General Insurance Results

General Insurance operating income in 2005 decreased after
accounting for catastrophe related losses, the fourth quarter
increase in reserves and changes in estimates related to
remediation of the material weakness in reconciliation of
balance sheet accounts. This decrease was partially offset by
strong profitable growth in Foreign General’s underwriting
results and DBG’s and Foreign General’s net investment
income. DBG’s underwriting results also included additional
losses incurred resulting from increased labor and material
costs related to the 2004 Florida hurricanes. General Insurance
operating income in 2004 showed positive results, even after
accounting for catastrophe losses, the charge for asbestos and
environmental exposures and the $232 million charge
reflecting a change in estimate for salvage and subrogation
recoveries. Net investment income and the capital gains realized
in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003 also
benefited General Insurance results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Continued

DBG’s net premiums written increased modestly in 2005 when
compared to 2004, reflecting generally improving renewal
retention rates and a modest change in the mix of business
towards smaller accounts for which DBG purchases less
reinsurance. DBG also continued to expand its relationships with
a larger number and broader range of brokers. Recently, DBG has
seen improvement in domestic property rates as well as increases
in submission activity in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes.
DBG attributes the increase in submissions to its overall
financial strength in comparison to many insurers that
experienced significant losses and reductions of surplus as a
result of the hurricanes.

The DBG loss ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally as a
result of adverse loss development, the third and fourth quarter
2005 catastrophe related losses and the $197 million of
additional losses resulting from increased labor and material
costs related to the 2004 hurricanes.

The DBG expense ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally
due to an increase in net commissions resulting from the
replacement of certain ceded quota share reinsurance, for which
DBG earns a ceding commission, with

excess-of

-loss
reinsurance, which generally does not include a ceding
commission. Increases in other underwriting expenses at DBG
relate to the changes in estimates noted above, as well as
unusually high expenses for Personal Lines. The Foreign General
expense ratio increased in 2005 from 2004 principally because
consumer lines of business, which have higher acquisition costs,
have become more significant.

Transatlantic’s net premiums written and net premiums
earned for 2005 decreased compared to 2004, principally due to
competitive market conditions and increased ceding company
retentions in certain classes of business. The great majority of
the premium decrease relates to Transatlantic’s domestic
operations. Operating income decreased principally as a result
of the increased level of catastrophe losses.

Personal Lines net premiums written and net premiums earned for
2005 increased when compared to 2004 as a result of strong
growth in the Private Client Group and Agency Auto divisions due
to increased agent/broker appointments, greater penetration and
enhanced product offerings. AIG direct premiums are down
slightly from 2004 due to aggressive re-underwriting of the
previously acquired GE business and the discontinuation of
underwriting homeowners business. Involuntary auto premiums were
down in 2005 due to the decline in the assigned risk
marketplace. Underwriting profit declined in 2005 as a result of
hurricane losses and related expenses, reserve strengthening, an
increase in Agency Auto’s current accident year physical
damage loss ratio, and expenses incurred related to terminating
AIG’s relationship with The Robert Plan effective
December 31, 2005.

Mortgage Guaranty net premiums written were up slightly for 2005
when compared to 2004, reflecting growth in the second liens and
international businesses offset by higher ceded premiums. Higher
acquisition costs and lower earned premiums from certain single
premium product lines resulted in lower underwriting profit in
2005 compared to 2004. UGC continued to achieve expansion of its
international business in 2005.

Foreign General Insurance had strong results in 2005. Growth in
net premiums written for 2005 was achieved from new business as
well as new distribution channels. In Japan, the purchase in
February 2005 of the insurance portfolio of the Royal &
SunAlliance branch operations opened new distribution channels.
In the Far East, personal accident business exhibited strong
growth and had excellent results for 2005. Commercial lines in
Europe exhibited healthy growth and had positive results for
2005, partially offset by rate decreases in Australia and the
United Kingdom. Personal lines operations in Brazil and Latin
America continue to exhibit strong growth, which translated into
improved underwriting results for 2005. The Lloyd’s Ascot
syndicate continues to grow; however, insurance losses and
reinstatement premium costs relating to the hurricanes caused a
significant reduction in 2005 underwriting results. Foreign
General Insurance also benefited from a decrease in the fourth
quarter of 2005 in net reserves for loss and loss expense for
non-asbestos and environmental reserves. Approximately half of
the Foreign General Insurance net premiums written is derived
from commercial insurance and the remainder from consumer lines.

AIG transacts business in most major
foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of
General Insurance net premiums written.

AIG’s General Insurance results reflect the effects of
catastrophe related losses of $2.89 billion,
$1.05 billion and $83 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely
from year to year, making comparisons of recurring type business
more difficult. With respect to catastrophe losses, AIG believes
that it has taken appropriate steps, such as careful exposure
selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage, to reduce the
effect of the magnitude of possible future losses. The
occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated
frequency or severity, such as a terrorist attack, earthquake or
hurricane, that causes insured losses, however, could have a
material adverse effect on AIG’s results of operations,
liquidity or financial condition.

General Insurance net investment income grew in 2005 when
compared to 2004. AIG is benefiting from strong cash flow,
higher interest rates and increased partnership income. Cash
flow for Foreign General was lower in 2005 when compared to 2004
due to payments for catastrophe related losses incurred in 2005
and 2004 and for the purchase of the Royal &
SunAlliance branch operations. Partnership income was
particularly strong for Foreign General due to increases in
market valuations of infrastructure fund investments in Africa,
Asia, China, Eastern Europe and India. Additionally, net
investment income was positively affected by the compounding of
previously earned and reinvested net investment income. In

2004, net investment income increased when compared to 2003. See
also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein and
Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing
investment management of the General Insurance portfolios within
the overall objectives of the General Insurance operations. See
the discussion on “Valuation of Invested Assets”
herein.

The contribution of General Insurance operating income to
AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was
15 percent in 2005, compared to 21 percent in 2004 and
38 percent in 2003. The decrease in contribution
percentages in both 2005 and 2004 was largely the result of
reserve increases and the effects of catastrophe losses.

Reinsurance

AIG is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its General
Insurance operations. AIG insures risks globally, and its
reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide AIG
the level of reinsurance protection that AIG desires.
Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage
transaction and insurance line risk retention at prudent levels
set by management. AIG also purchases reinsurance to mitigate
its catastrophic exposure. AIG is cognizant of the need to
exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both
domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance
programs because one or more catastrophe losses could negatively
affect AIG’s reinsurers and result in an inability of AIG
to collect reinsurance recoverables. AIG’s reinsurance
department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the
probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events
through the use of state-of-the-art industry recognized program
models among other techniques. AIG supplements these models
through continually monitoring the risk exposure of AIG’s
worldwide General Insurance operations and adjusting such models
accordingly. Although reinsurance arrangements do not relieve
AIG from its direct obligations to its insureds, an efficient
and effective reinsurance program substantially limits
AIG’s exposure to potentially significant losses. With
respect to its property business, AIG has either renewed
existing coverage or purchased new coverage that, in the opinion
of management, is adequate to limit AIG’s exposures.

AIG’s consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to
$23.59 billion at December 31, 2005 and resulted from
AIG’s reinsurance arrangements. Thus, a credit exposure
existed at December 31, 2005 with respect to reinsurance
recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to
reimburse AIG under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements.
AIG manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by
transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound,
and when necessary AIG holds substantial collateral in the form
of funds, securities and/or irrevocable letters of credit. This
collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond
specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis. At
December 31, 2005, approximately 48 percent of the
general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers.
Many of these balances were collateralized, permitting statutory
recognition. Additionally, with the approval of its domiciliary
insurance regulators, AIG posted approximately $1.5 billion
of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor
of certain Domestic General Insurance companies to permit
statutory recognition of balances otherwise uncollateralized at
December 31, 2005. The remaining 52 percent of the
general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers. The
terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory
categories, not creditworthiness. At December 31, 2005,
approximately 88 percent of the balances with respect to
authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated
A (excellent) or better, as rated by A.M. Best, or A
(strong) or better, as rated by S&P. These ratings are
measures of financial strength.

AIG maintains a reserve for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance.
While AIG has been largely successful in its previous recovery
efforts, at December 31, 2005, AIG had a reserve for
unrecoverable reinsurance approximating $992 million. At
that date, AIG had no significant reinsurance recoverables due
from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled
(e.g., liquidated, insolvent, in receivership or otherwise
subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction).

AIG’s Reinsurance Security Department conducts ongoing
detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and
potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. Such
assessments include, but are not limited to, identifying if a
reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial
capacity, and evaluating the local economic environment in which
a foreign reinsurer operates. This department also reviews the
nature of the risks ceded and the requirements for credit risk
mitigants. For example, in AIG’s treaty reinsurance
contracts, AIG includes provisions that frequently require a
reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs.
Furthermore, AIG limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers
through the use of credit triggers, which include, but are not
limited to, insurer financial strength rating downgrades,
policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain
predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a
reinsurance recoverable being reached. In addition, AIG’s
Credit Risk Committee reviews the credit limits for and
concentrations with any one reinsurer.

AIG enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions, primarily
through AIRCO, for its General Insurance and Life Insurance
operations. AIG enters into these transactions as a sound and
prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting
control and spread insurance risk among AIG’s various legal
entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the
appropriate regulatory authorities. All material intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. AIG
generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory
recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions. At
December 31, 2005, approximately $3.6 billion of
letters of credit were outstanding to cover intercompany
reinsurance transactions with AIRCO or other General Insurance
subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2005, the consolidated general reinsurance
assets of $23.59 billion include reinsurance recoverables
for paid losses and loss expenses of $829 million and
$19.69 bil-

lion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss
expenses, including ceded losses incurred but not reported
(IBNR) (ceded reserves) and $3.07 billion of ceded reserve
for unearned premiums. The ceded reserve for losses and loss
expenses represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate
ceded losses including provisions for ceded IBNR and loss
expenses. The methods used to determine such estimates and to
establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed
and updated by management. Any adjustments thereto are reflected
in income currently. It is AIG’s belief that the ceded
reserve for losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2005
were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable. In the
future, as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate
amounts, the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less
than the reserves currently ceded.

Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses

The table below classifies as of
December 31, 2005 the components of the General Insurance
gross reserve for losses and loss expenses (loss reserves) by
major lines of business on a statutory Annual Statement
basis*:

*

Presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory
    reporting requirements as prescribed by the National Association
    of Insurance Commissioners.

AIG’s reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the
accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses, including IBNR and
loss expenses. The methods used to determine loss reserve
estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are
continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments
resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently.
Because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of
future events, changes in estimates are unavoidable given that
loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in
trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that
increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as
unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening.
Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate
cost are referred to as favorable development.

At December 31, 2005, General Insurance net loss reserves
were $57.5 billion, an increase of $10.22 billion from
the prior year-end. The net loss reserve increase includes the
fourth quarter 2005 increase in net reserves of approximately
$1.8 billion, comprised of $960 million for
non-asbestos and environmental exposures, and $873 million
for asbestos and environmental exposures. The increase in
non-asbestos and environmental reserves includes an increase of
$1.44 billion for DBG and decreases of $455 million
for Foreign General Insurance and $29 million for Mortgage
Guaranty. The DBG increase of $1.44 billion is
$140 million greater than the amount previously announced
in AIG’s press release of February 9, 2006 as a result
of an additional change in estimate related to a commuted
reinsurance agreement. The aggregate increase in asbestos and
environmental reserves includes increases of $706 million
and $167 million, respectively, for DBG and Foreign General
Insurance.

As discussed in more detail below, the fourth quarter 2005
reserve increase was attributable to adverse development
primarily related to 2002 and prior accident years, partially
offset by favorable development for accident years 2003 through
2005. This reserve action reflects the completion of both the
Milliman, Inc. (Milliman) review and AIG’s own actuarial
studies in the fourth quarter of 2005.

The net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by
reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for unrecoverable
reinsurance and applicable discount for future investment
income. The table below classifies the components of the General
Insurance net loss reserves by business unit as of
December 31, 2005.

The DBG net loss reserve of $40.78 billion is comprised
principally of the business of AIG subsidiaries participating in
the American Home/ National Union pool (11 companies) and the
surplus lines pool (Lexington, Starr Excess Liability Insurance
Company and Landmark Insurance Company).

Beginning in 1998, DBG ceded a quota share percentage of its
other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence
business to AIRCO. The quota share percentage ceded was
40 percent in 1998, 65 percent in 1999,
75 percent in 2000 and 2001, 50 percent in 2002 and
2003, 40 percent in 2004 and 35 percent in 2005 and
covered all business written in these years for these lines by
participants in the American Home/National Union pool. In 1998
the cession reflected only the other liability occurrence
business, but in 1999 and

subsequent years included products liability occurrence.
AIRCO’s loss reserves relating to these quota share
cessions from DBG are recorded on a discounted basis. As of
year-end 2005, AIRCO carried a discount of approximately
$490 million applicable to the $4.26 billion in
undiscounted reserves it assumed from the American Home/National
Union pool via this quota share cession. AIRCO also carries
approximately $440 million in net loss reserves relating to
Foreign General insurance business. These reserves are carried
on an undiscounted basis.

Beginning in 1997, the Personal Lines division ceded a
percentage of all business written by the companies
participating in the personal lines pool to the American
Home/National Union pool. As noted above, the total reserves
carried by participants in the American Home/National Union pool
relating to this cession amounted to $878 million as of
year-end 2005.

The companies participating in the American Home/National Union
pool have maintained a participation in the business written by
AIU for decades. As of year-end 2005, these AIU reserves carried
by participants in the American Home/National Union pool
amounted to approximately $2.15 billion. The remaining
Foreign General reserves are carried by AIUO, AIRCO, and other
smaller AIG subsidiaries domiciled outside the United States.
Statutory filings in the U.S. by AIG companies reflect all the
business written by U.S. domiciled entities only, and therefore
exclude business written by AIUO, AIRCO, and all other
internationally domiciled subsidiaries. The total reserves
carried at year-end 2005 by AIUO and AIRCO were approximately
$3.72 billion and $4.21 billion, respectively.
AIRCO’s $4.21 billion in total general insurance
reserves consist of approximately $3.77 billion from
business assumed from the American Home/National Union pool and
an additional $440 million relating to Foreign General
Insurance business.

Discounting of Reserves

At December 31, 2005, AIG’s overall General Insurance
net loss reserves reflects a loss reserve discount of
$2.11 billion, including tabular and non-tabular
calculations. The tabular workers compensation discount is
calculated using a 3.5 percent interest rate and the

1979-81

Decennial
Mortality Table. The non-tabular workers compensation discount
is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York and
Pennsylvania, and follows the statutory regulations for each
state. For New York companies, the discount is based on a five
percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout
patterns. For Pennsylvania companies, the statute has specified
discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior, which are
based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout
pattern. For accident years 2002 and subsequent, the discount is
based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one
to twenty years and the company’s own payout pattern, with
the future expected payment for each year using the interest
rate associated with the corresponding Treasury security yield
for that time period. The discount is comprised of the
following: $512 million — tabular discount for
workers compensation in DBG; $1.11 billion —
non-tabular discount for workers compensation in DBG; and,
$490 million — non-tabular discount for other
liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in AIRCO.
The total undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried
by DBG is approximately $9.5 billion as of year-end 2005.
The other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence
business in AIRCO that is assumed from DBG is discounted based
on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities ranging from one
to twenty years and the DBG payout pattern for this business.
The undiscounted reserves assumed by AIRCO from DBG totaled
approximately $4.26 billion at December 31, 2005.

Results of 2005 Reserving
Process

It is management’s belief that the General Insurance net
loss reserves are adequate to cover General Insurance net losses
and loss expenses as of December 31, 2005. While AIG
annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves,
there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves
will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s loss
reserves as of December 31, 2005. In the opinion of
management, such adverse development and resulting increase in
reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on
AIG’s consolidated financial position, although it could
have a material adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated
results of operations for an individual reporting period. See
“Risk Factors — Casualty Insurance and
Underwriting Reserves” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

As part of the 2005 year-end actuarial loss reserve analysis,
AIG expanded its review processes and conducted additional
studies. In addition, in August 2005, AIG commissioned Milliman
to provide an independent, comprehensive review of the loss
reserves of AIG’s principal property-casualty insurance
operations, including an independent ground up study of
AIG’s asbestos and environmental exposures. The Milliman
review encompassed nearly all of AIG’s carried loss
reserves, other than those pertaining to the operations of
Transatlantic and 21st Century. AIG’s management carefully
considered the analyses provided by its actuarial staff and by
Milliman for each class of business in determining AIG’s
best estimate of its loss reserves.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Continued

The table below presents the
reconciliation of net loss reserves for 2005, 2004 and 2003 as
follows:

For 2005, AIG’s overall net loss
reserve development from prior accident years was an increase of
approximately $4.67 billion, including approximately
$269 million from the general reinsurance operations of
Transatlantic. This $4.67 billion adverse development in
2005 was comprised of approximately $8.60 billion for 2002
and prior accident years, partially offset by favorable
development for accident years 2003 and 2004 for most lines of
business, with the notable exception being D&O. The adverse
loss development for 2002 and prior accident years is
attributable to approximately $4.0 billion of development
from D&O and related management liability classes of
business, excess casualty, and excess workers compensation, and
to approximately $873 million of development from asbestos
and environmental claims. The remaining portion of the adverse
development for 2002 and prior accident years includes
approximately $520 million related to Transatlantic with
the balance spread across many other lines of business.

The largest contributors to the $4.67
billion net adverse loss development were:

D&O and related management liability classes of
business:

The adverse development for 2002 and prior
accident years totalled approximately $1.7 billion,
principally related to 2002 and prior accident years. This
adverse development resulted from significant loss cost
escalation due to a variety of factors, including the following:
the increase in frequency and severity of corporate
bankruptcies; the increase in frequency of financial statement
restatements; the sharp rise in market capitalization of
publicly traded companies and the increase in the number of
initial public offerings, which led to an unprecedented number
of IPO allocation/laddering suits in 2001. In addition, the
extensive utilization of multi-year policies during this period
limited AIG’s ability to respond to emerging trends as
rapidly as would otherwise be the case.

AIG has experienced significant adverse
loss development since 2002 as a result of these issues. AIG has
taken numerous actions in response to this development,
including rate increases and policy form and coverage changes to
better contain future loss costs in this class of business.
AIG’s 2005 year-end actuarial reserve analyses for DBG
exposures reflected several other noteworthy additional
considerations and studies. AIG’s claims staff conducted a
series of ground-up claim projections covering all open claims
for this class of business through accident year 2004. Given the
adverse development observed for this class of business in
recent years, for year-end 2005 AIG believed its reserves for
this class were better estimated by benchmarking the actuarial
indications to these claim projections.

Excess Casualty:

The adverse development for prior
years was approximately $1.3 billion related to 2001 and
prior accident years. This adverse development resulted from
significant loss cost increases due to both frequency and
severity of claims. The primary drivers of the increasing loss
costs were medical inflation, which increased the economic loss
component of tort claims; advances in medical care, which
extended the life span of severely injured workers; and larger
jury verdicts, which increased the value of severe tort claims.
An additional factor affecting AIG’s excess casualty
experience in recent years has been the accelerated exhaustion
of underlying primary policies for homebuilders. This has led to
increasing construction defect related claim activity on
AIG’s excess policies. As noted above for D&O, many
excess casualty policies were written on a multi-year basis in
the late 1990s, which limited AIG’s ability to respond to
emerging trends as rapidly as would otherwise be the case. AIG
responded to these emerging trends by increasing rates and
effecting numerous policy form and coverage changes. This led to
a significant improvement in experience beginning with accident
year 2001. In response to the continuing loss development, AIG
increased further the loss development factors for this class of
business in its 2005 year-end actuarial reserve analysis. In
addition, to more accurately estimate losses for construction
defects, a separate review was performed by AIG claims staff for
accounts with significant exposure to these claims.

Excess Workers Compensation:

The adverse development
for prior years was approximately $1 billion related to
2002 and prior accident years. This adverse development resulted
from significant loss cost increases, primarily attributable to
rapidly increasing medical inflation and advances in medical
care, which increased the cost of covered medical care and
extended the life span of severely injured workers. The effect
of these factors on excess workers compensation claims
experience is leveraged, as frequency is increased by the rising
number of claims that reach the excess layers.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

In response to the continuing loss
development, an additional study was conducted for the 2005
year-end actuarial reserve analysis for DBG pertaining to the
selection of loss development factors for this class of
business. Claims for excess workers compensation exhibit an
exceptionally long tail of loss development, running for decades
from the date the loss is incurred. Thus, the adequacy of loss
reserves for this class is sensitive to the estimated loss
development factors, as such factors may be applied to many
years of loss experience. In order to better estimate the tail
development for this class, AIG claims staff conducted a claim
by claim projection of the expected ultimate paid loss for each
open claim for 1998 and prior accident years as these are the
primary years that drive the tail factors. The objective of the
study was to provide a benchmark against which loss development
factors in the tail could be evaluated.

For a discussion of the adverse
development in asbestos and environmental exposures, see
“Asbestos and Environmental Reserves” below.

The favorable development in 2005 referred to above was
principally the result of the following: Most classes of
business, with the notable exception of D&O, experienced
favorable loss development for accident year 2003, and nearly
all classes experienced favorable development for accident year
2004. These accident years are benefiting from the actions AIG
has taken in response to the significant improvement in market
conditions that occurred beginning in 2001 and that accelerated
thereafter. Rates increased sharply for most classes of
business, and policy terms and conditions were also improved
significantly. In connection with AIG’s 2005 year-end
actuarial reserve analysis and after considering the results of
the Milliman review, AIG has recognized the improving results to
the extent they are credible, evidenced by up to five years of
favorable loss experience across many lines of business since
the market conditions improved. In addition, AIG has taken this
information into consideration in determining the expected loss
ratios for the 2005 accident year.

Overview of Loss Reserving Process

The General Insurance loss reserves can generally be categorized
into two distinct groups. One group is long-tail casualty lines
of business which include excess and umbrella liability,
D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers
compensation, general liability, products liability, and related
classes. The other group is short-tail lines of business
consisting principally of property lines, personal lines and
certain classes of casualty lines.

Short-Tail Reserves

For operations writing short-tail coverages, such as property
coverages, the process of recording quarterly loss reserve
changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve
level for the outstanding exposure, rather than determining an
expected loss ratio for current business. For example, the IBNR
reserve required for a class of property business might be
expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest
year’s earned premiums, and this level of reserve would
generally be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in
the current quarter. The 20 percent factor is adjusted to
reflect changes in rate levels, loss reporting patterns, known
exposures to large unreported losses, or other factors affecting
the particular class of business.

Long-Tail Reserves

Estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses (net losses)
for long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process
and depends on a number of factors, including the line and
volume of the business involved. Experience in the more recent
accident years of long-tail casualty lines shows limited
statistical credibility in reported net losses because a
relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims
and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses
paid. Therefore, IBNR would constitute a relatively high
proportion of net losses.

AIG’s carried net long-tail loss reserves are tested using
loss trend factors that AIG considers most appropriate for each
class of business. A variety of actuarial methods and
assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for
long-tail casualty lines. These methods ordinarily involve the
use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated
annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next.
For the majority of long-tail casualty lines, net loss trend
factors approximated five percent. Loss trend factors reflect
many items including changes in claims handling, exposure and
policy forms; current and future estimates of monetary inflation
and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards.
These factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently
adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect emerging trends which are
based upon past loss experience. Thus, many factors are
implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in
loss costs recognized.

A number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of
reserves for each line of business. For longer tail lines of
business, actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect
to the following:

-

Loss trend factors which are used
    to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years
    based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years.

-

Expected loss ratios for the
    latest accident year (

i.e.

, accident year 2005 for the
    year end 2005 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases, for
    accident years prior to the latest accident year. The expected
    loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from
    prior accident years, adjusted for the loss trend (see above)
    and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors.
    For low-frequency, high-severity classes such as excess casualty
    and D&O, expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at
    least the three most recent accident years.

-

Loss development factors which are
    used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an
    ultimate basis.

AIG records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its
many General Insurance profit centers. The overall change in
AIG’s loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit
center level changes. For most profit centers which write longer
tail classes of casualty coverage, the process of recording
quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the
estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage. This
loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarter’s net
earned premium for that

class of coverage to determine the quarter’s total
estimated net incurred loss and loss expense. The change in loss
reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference
between the net incurred loss and loss expense, estimated as
described above, and the net paid losses and loss expenses in
the quarter.

Details of the Loss Reserving
Process

The process of determining the current loss ratio for each class
or business segment is based on a variety of factors. These
include, but are not limited to, the following considerations:
prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; actual and
anticipated rate changes; actual and anticipated changes in
coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business; actual and
anticipated changes in external factors affecting results, such
as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment.
Each profit center’s current loss ratio reflects input from
actuarial, profit center and claims staff and is intended to
represent management’s best estimate of the current loss
ratio after reflecting all of the factors described above. At
the close of each quarter, the assumptions underlying the loss
ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based
thereon remain appropriate. This process includes a review of
the actual claims experience in the quarter, actual rate changes
achieved, actual changes in coverage, reinsurance or mix of
business, and changes in certain other factors that may affect
the loss ratio. When this review suggests that the initially
determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate, the loss ratio
for current business would be changed to reflect the revised
assumptions.

A comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the
fourth quarter of each year for each AIG General Insurance
subsidiary. These reviews are conducted in full detail for each
class or line of business for each subsidiary, and thus consist
of literally hundreds of individual analyses. The purpose of
these reviews is to confirm the appropriateness of the reserves
carried by each of the individual subsidiaries, and thereby of
AIG’s overall carried reserves. The reserve analysis for
each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who
are most familiar with that class of business. In completing
these detailed actuarial reserve analyses, the actuaries are
required to make numerous assumptions, including for example the
selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend
factors. They are also required to determine and select the most
appropriate actuarial method(s) to employ for each business
class. Additionally, they must determine the appropriate
segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the
reserves can be most accurately tested. In the course of these
detailed reserve reviews for each business segment, a point
estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined. The sum of
these point estimates for each of the individual business
classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point
estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary. The ultimate
process by which the actual carried reserves are determined
considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of
other factors. Other crucial internal and external factors
considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and
other economic conditions in the United States and abroad,
changes in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social
environments, underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions,
and claims handling. Loss reserve development can also be
affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance
agreements.

AIG’s annual loss reserve review does not calculate a range
of loss reserve estimates. Because a large portion of the loss
reserves from AIG’s General Insurance business relates to
long-tail casualty lines driven by severity rather than
frequency of claims, such as excess casualty and D&O,
developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be
meaningful. An estimate is calculated which AIG’s actuaries
believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve.
This amount is then evaluated against actual carried reserves.

Volatility of Reserve Estimates and
Sensitivity Analyses

There is potential for significant variation in the development
of loss reserves, particularly for long-tail casualty classes of
business such as excess casualty, when actual costs differ from
the assumptions used to test the reserves. Such assumptions
include those made for loss trend factors and loss development
factors, as described earlier. Set forth below is a sensitivity
analysis demonstrating the estimated effect on the loss reserve
position of alternative loss trend or loss development factor
assumptions as compared to those actually used to test the
carried reserves.

For the excess casualty class of business the assumed loss cost
trend was approximately six percent. A five percent
change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to
the next would cause approximately a $600 million change
(either positively or negatively) to the net loss and loss
expense reserve for this business. For the D&O and related
management liability classes of business the assumed loss cost
trend was four percent. A five percent change in this
assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a
$300 million change (either positively or negatively) to
the net loss and loss expense reserve for such business. The
effect of the loss trend assumption for the D&O class
decreased in 2005 as a result of AIG’s change in
methodology, as described above, whereby claim projections
through accident year 2004 are utilized as a benchmark for the
actuarial indications. For the excess workers compensation class
of business, loss costs were trended at six percent per annum. A
five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause
approximately a $250 million change (either positively or
negatively) to the loss and loss expense reserve for this class.
Actual loss cost trends in the early 1990’s were negative
for these classes, whereas in the late 1990’s loss costs
trends ran well into the double digits for each of these three
classes. The sharp increase in loss costs in the late
1990’s was thus much greater than the five percent
changes cited above, and caused significant increases in the
overall loss reserve needs for these classes. While changes in
the loss cost trend assumptions can have a significant effect on
the reserve needs for other smaller classes of liability
business, the potential effect of these changes on AIG’s
overall carried reserves would be much less than for the classes
noted above.

For the excess casualty class, if future loss development
factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the
year-end 2005 loss reserve review, there would be approximately a


AIG

-

10-K

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

$400 million change (either positively or negatively) to
the overall AIG loss reserve position. The comparable effect on
the D&O and related management liability classes would be
approximately $200 million (either positively or
negatively) if future loss development factors differed by five
percent from those utilized in the year-end 2005 loss reserve
review. For the excess workers compensation class, the effect
would be approximately $150 million (either positively or
negatively). For workers compensation reserves, other than
excess workers compensation reserves, the effect of a
five percent deviation from the loss development factors
utilized in the year-end 2005 reserve reviews would be
approximately $1.0 billion (either positively or
negatively). Because loss development factors for this class
have shown less volatility than higher severity classes such as
excess casualty, however, actual changes in loss development
factors are expected to be less than five percent. There is
some degree of volatility in loss development patterns for other
longer tail liability classes as well. However, the potential
effect on AIG’s reserves would be much less than for the
classes cited above.

The calculations of the effect of the five percent change
in loss development factors are made by selecting the stage of
accident year development where it is believed reasonable for
such a deviation to occur. For example, for workers
compensation, the $1.0 billion amount is calculated by
assuming that each of the most recent eight accident years
develop five percent higher than estimated by the current
loss development factors utilized in the reserve study,

i.e.

the factor 1.05 is multiplied by the incurred losses
(including IBNR and loss expenses) for these accident years.

AIG management believes that using a five percent change in
the assumptions for loss cost trends and loss development
factors provides a reasonable benchmark for a sensitivity
analysis of the reserves of AIG’s most significant lines of
general insurance business. For excess casualty business, both
the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions
are critical. Generally, actual historical loss development
factors are used to project future loss development. However,
there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns
will be the same as in the past. Moreover, as excess casualty is
a long-tail class of business, any deviation in loss cost trends
or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an
extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the
initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus,
there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number
of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the
loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially
relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss
trends or loss development factors could be attributable to
changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other
social or economic phenomena affecting claims. For example,
during the lengthy periods during which losses develop for
excess casualty, actual changes in loss costs from one accident
year to the next have ranged from negative values to
double-digit amounts. Thus, there is the potential for
significant volatility in loss costs for excess casualty and,
although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for
sensitivity analysis for this business, there is the potential
for variations far greater than this amount (either positively
or negatively). Likewise, in the judgment of AIG’s
actuaries, five percent is considered an appropriate
benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss
development factor assumptions used to test the reserves.

For D&O and related management liability classes of
business, the loss cost trend assumption has been critical in
past analyses, however, because of the utilization of claim
projections for all claims through accident year 2004, as
described above, the sensitivity of the reserves to this
assumption has been reduced in 2005. The loss development factor
assumption is important but less critical than for excess
casualty. As this coverage is written on a claims-made basis,
claims for a given accident year are all reported within that
year. Actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the
next in the 1990s ranged from double digit negative values for
several accident years in the early 1990s to nearly
50 percent per year for the period from accident year 1996
to accident year 1999. Thus, there is the potential for extreme
volatility in loss costs for this business and, although
five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for
sensitivity analysis, there is the potential for variations far
greater than this amount (either positively or negatively).
Five percent is also considered an appropriate benchmark
for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development
factor assumptions used to test the reserves for these classes.
However, as noted above, the effect of such a deviation is less
than that of a similar deviation in loss cost trends. For the
excess workers compensation class, the loss development factor
assumptions are critical and the loss trend assumption is
important but not as critical. Excess workers compensation is an
extremely long tail class of business, hence there is a much
greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss
development factors for the tail of the loss development. As
noted above, the effect of a five percent change in the loss
development factor is approximately $150 million. It would
not be uncommon for the loss development factors to deviate by
greater than five percent for this class of business.

For workers compensation, the loss development factor
assumptions are important. Generally, AIG’s actual
historical workers compensation loss development would be
expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future
loss development. A five percent sensitivity indicator for
workers compensation would thus be considered to be toward the
high end of potential deviations for this class of business. The
loss cost trend assumption for workers compensation is not
believed to be material with respect to AIG’s loss
reserves. This is primarily because AIG’s actuaries are
generally able to use loss development projections for all but
the most recent accident year’s reserves, so there is
limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for workers
compensation business.

For casualty business other than the classes noted above, there
is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost
trend and loss development factor selections. However, the
effect of such deviations would not be material when compared to
the effect on the classes cited above.

Asbestos and Environmental
Reserves

The estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and
environmental claims on insurance policies written many years
ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims
due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial
interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have
tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such
policies and in others have expanded theories of liability. The
insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation
over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted
with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these
exposures.

AIG continues to receive claims asserting injuries and damages
from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental
pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of
hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as
environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries
from asbestos.

The vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims
emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years.
Commencing in 1985, standard policies contained an absolute
exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos
exclusion was also implemented. However, AIG currently
underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a
claims-made basis and has excluded such claims from the analysis
herein.

The majority of AIG’s exposures for asbestos and
environmental claims are excess casualty coverages, not primary
coverages. Thus, the litigation costs are treated in the same
manner as indemnity amounts. That is, litigation expenses are
included within the limits of the liability AIG incurs.
Individual significant claim liabilities, where future
litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on
a case basis.

Estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is
a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental
claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving
techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year
loss development factors.

Significant factors which affect the trends that influence the
asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the
inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations
which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage.
The current case law can be characterized as still evolving, and
there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop
in the near future. Additionally, the exposures for cleanup
costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as
allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible
parties and the government’s refusal to release parties.

Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible to determine the
future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the
same degree of reliability as with other types of claims. Such
future development will be affected by the extent to which
courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the
scope of the coverage, as they have in the past, as well as by
the changes in Superfund and waste dump site coverage and
liability issues. If the asbestos and environmental reserves
develop deficiently, such deficiency would have an adverse
effect on AIG’s future results of operations. AIG does not
discount asbestos and environmental reserves.

With respect to known asbestos and environmental claims, AIG
established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and
environmental claims units, which investigate and adjust all
such asbestos and environmental claims. These units evaluate
these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a
claim-by-claim approach that involves a detailed review of
individual policy terms and exposures. Because each policyholder
presents different liability and coverage issues, AIG generally
evaluates exposure on a

policy-by

-policy basis,
considering a variety of factors such as known facts, current
law, jurisdiction, policy language and other factors that are
unique to each policy. Quantitative techniques have to be
supplemented by subjective considerations including management
judgment. Each claim is reviewed at least semi-annually
utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary
to reflect the current information.

In both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental
claims units, AIG actively manages and pursues early resolution
with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its
exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims. AIG
attempts to mitigate its known long-tail environmental exposures
by utilizing a combination of proactive claim-resolution
techniques including policy buybacks, complete environmental
releases, compromise settlements, and, where indicated,
litigation.

With respect to asbestos claims handling, AIG’s specialized
claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive
handling, supervision and resolution of asbestos cases. Thus,
while AIG has resolved all claims with respect to miners and
major manufacturers (Tier One), its claims staff continues
to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims
involving accounts with products containing asbestos
(Tier Two), products containing small amounts of asbestos,
companies in the distribution process, and parties with remote,
ill defined involvement in asbestos (Tiers Three and Four).
Through its commitment to appropriate staffing, training, and
management oversight of asbestos cases, AIG mitigates to the
extent possible its exposure to these claims.

To determine the appropriate loss reserve as of
December 31, 2005 for its asbestos and environmental
exposures, AIG performed a series of top-down and

ground-up

reserve
analyses. In order to ensure it had the most comprehensive
analysis possible, AIG engaged Milliman to provide an analysis
of these exposures including

ground-up

estimates for
both asbestos reserves and environmental reserves. Prior to
2005, AIG’s reserve analyses for asbestos and environmental
exposures was focused around a report year projection of
aggregate losses for both asbestos and environmental reserves.
Additional tests such as market share analyses were also
performed.

Ground-up

analyses such as those provided by Milliman take into account
policyholder-specific and claim-specific information that has
been gathered over many years from a variety of sources.

Ground-up

studies can
thus more accurately assess the exposure to AIG’s layers of
coverage for each policyholder, and hence


AIG

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

for all policyholders in the aggregate provided a sufficient
sample of the policyholders can be modeled in this manner.

In order to ensure its

ground-up

analysis was
as comprehensive as possible, AIG staff produced the information
required at policy and claim level detail for nearly
1,000 asbestos defendants and over 1,100 environmental
defendants. This represented nearly 90 percent of all
accounts for which AIG had received any claim notice of any
amount pertaining to asbestos or environmental exposure. AIG did
not set any minimum thresholds such as amount of case reserve
outstanding, or paid losses to date, that would have served to
reduce the sample size and hence the comprehensiveness of the

ground-up

analysis. The
results of the

ground-up

analysis for
each significant account were examined by AIG’s claims
staff for reasonableness, for consistency with policy coverage
terms, and any claim settlement terms applicable. Adjustments
were incorporated accordingly. The results from the universe of
modeled accounts, which as noted above reflects the vast
majority of AIG’s known exposures, were then utilized to
estimate the ultimate losses from accounts that could not be
modeled and to determine the appropriate provision for all
unreported claims.

AIG conducted a comprehensive analysis of reinsurance
recoverability to establish the appropriate asbestos and
environmental reserve net of reinsurance. AIG determined the
amount of reinsurance that would be ceded to insolvent
reinsurers or to commuted reinsurance contracts for both
reported claims and for IBNR. These amounts were then deducted
from the indicated amount of reinsurance recoverable.

AIG also completed a top-down report year projection of its
indicated asbestos and environmental loss reserves. These
projections consist of a series of tests performed separately
for asbestos and for environmental exposures.

For asbestos, these tests project the expected losses to be
reported over the next twenty years, i.e., from 2006 through
2025, based on the actual losses reported through 2005 and the
expected future loss emergence for these claims. Three scenarios
were tested, with a series of assumptions ranging from more
optimistic to more conservative. In the first scenario, all
carried asbestos case reserves are assumed to be within ten
percent of their ultimate settlement value. The second scenario
relies on an actuarial projection of report year development for
asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate
case reserve adequacy as of

year-end

2005. The
third scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year
claims for asbestos but reflects claims reported from 1989 to
the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of

year-end

2005. Based on
the results of the prior report years for each of the three
scenarios described above, the report year approach then
projects forward to the year 2025 the expected future report
year losses, based on AIG’s estimate of reasonable loss
trend assumptions. These calculations are performed on losses
gross of reinsurance. The IBNR (including a provision for
development of reported claims) on a net basis is based on
applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to
gross losses for future loss emergence.

For environmental claims, an analogous series of frequency/
severity tests are produced. Environmental claims from future
report years, (i.e., IBNR) are projected out ten years, i.e.,
through the year 2015.

At year-end 2005, AIG considered a number of factors and recent
experience, in addition to the results of the respective

top-down

and

ground-up

analyses
performed for asbestos and environmental reserves. Among the
factors considered by AIG was the continued deterioration in its
asbestos report year experience. The indication from the third
scenario as described above for asbestos was approximately
$265 million greater than AIG’s carried net asbestos
reserve, prior to its increase in the fourth quarter of 2005.
This marks a continuation of the trend of adverse report year
development for asbestos that has been observed for the past
several years. AIG also noted its asbestos paid losses in 2005
increased from 2004’s levels. AIG considered the
significant uncertainty that remains as to AIG’s ultimate
liability relating to asbestos and environmental claims. This
uncertainty is due to several factors including:

-

The long latency period between
    asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting
    potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for
    individual claims;

-

The increase in the volume of
    claims by currently unimpaired plaintiffs;

-

Claims filed under the
    non-aggregate premises or operations section of general
    liability policies;

-

The number of insureds seeking
    bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies;

-

Diverging legal interpretations;
    and

-

With respect to environmental
    claims, the difficulty in estimating the allocation of
    remediation cost among various parties.

After carefully considering the results of the

ground-up

analysis,
which AIG now plans to update on an annual basis, as well as all
of the above factors including the recent report year
experience, AIG determined its best estimate was to recognize an
increase of $843 million in its carried net asbestos
reserves, and an increase of $30 million in its carried net
environmental reserves at December 31, 2005. The
corresponding increases in gross reserves were approximately
$1.97 billion for asbestos and $56 million for
environmental.

The opened claims count increased substantially during 2005
    because a court ruling led AIG to report separate opened claims
    for previously pending cases relating to alleged MTBE exposures
    that AIG previously had counted in the aggregate as only a
    single claim on the assumption that the cases would be

The table below presents AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos
and environmental claims for year end 2005, 2004 and 2003. The
survival ratio is derived by dividing the year end carried loss
reserve by the average payments for the three most recent
calendar years for these claims. Therefore the survival ratio is
a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be
before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would
be paid off using recent year average payments. Many factors,
such as aggressive settlement procedures, mix of business and
level of coverage provided, have a significant effect on the
amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and
the resultant survival ratio. Thus, caution should be

claims based simply on this survival ratio.

AIG’s survival ratios for asbestos
and environmental claims, separately and combined were based
upon a three-year average payment. These ratios for the years

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services Operations

AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services
subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and retirement
savings products both domestically and abroad.
Insurance-oriented products consist of individual and group
life, payout annuities, endowment and accident and health

and variable annuities. See also Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Domestically, AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations offer a broad range of protection products,
including life insurance, group life and health products,
including disability income products and payout annuities, which
include single premium immediate annuities, structured
settlements and terminal funding annuities. Home service
operations include an array of life insurance, accident and
health and annuity products sold through career agents. In
addition, home service includes a small block of run-off
property and casualty coverage. Retirement services include
group retirement products, individual fixed and variable
annuities sold through banks, broker dealers and exclusive sales
representatives, and annuity runoff operations which include
previously-acquired “closed blocks” and other fixed
and variable annuities largely sold through distribution
relationships that have been discontinued.

Overseas, AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations include insurance and investment-oriented
products such as whole and term life, investment linked,
universal life and endowments, personal accident and health
products, group products including pension, life and health, and

Life Insurance & Retirement
Services Results

The increase in operating income in 2005 compared to 2004 was
caused by growth in both domestic and overseas operations.
Similarly, the increase in operating income in 2004 compared to
2003 was due to strong growth, particularly overseas.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums grew
in 2005 when compared with 2004 as well as 2004 when compared
with 2003. AIG’s Domestic Life operations had continued
growth in term and universal life sales with good performance
from the independent distribution channels. GAAP premiums for
life insurance grew 12 percent in 2005 reflecting
consistently strong sales from the independent distribution
channels. Retail periodic life sales increased 18 percent
in 2005, representing a compound rate of growth of
16 percent since 2001, compared to modest growth in the
industry. Profit margins have been maintained through strict
underwriting discipline and low cost. In addition, increases in
product prices and retention have offset price increases by
reinsurers. Payout annuities declined slightly due to the low
interest rate environment and the competitive market conditions
for structured settlement and single premium individual annuity
business. The domestic group business is below AIG’s growth
standards, largely because several accounts where pricing was
unacceptable were not renewed and loss experience was higher
than anticipated. Restructuring efforts in this business are
focused on new product introductions, cross selling and other
growth strategies. AGLA, the home service business, is
diversifying product offerings, enhancing the capabilities and
quality of the sales force, and broadening the markets served
beyond those historically serviced in an effort to accelerate
growth, although it is expected to remain a slow growth business.

Domestic Retirement Services businesses faced a challenging
environment in 2005 and 2004, as deposits declined approximately
17 percent for 2005 compared to 2004 and 1 percent for
2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in AIG’s individual
variable annuity product sales in 2005 was largely attributable
to significant variable annuity sales declines at several of
AIG’s largest distribution firms due to lackluster equity
markets, more

intense industry competition with regard to living benefit
product features and heightened compliance procedures over
selling practices. AIG’s introduction of more competitive
guaranteed minimum withdrawal features was delayed until late in
the fourth quarter due to filing delays associated with the
Restatements. During 2005, the interest yield curve flattened
and, as a result, competing bank products such as certificates
of deposit and other money market instruments with shorter
durations than AIG’s individual fixed annuity products
became more attractive. The following table reflects deposit
amounts for Domestic Retirement Services:

In 2005, AIG experienced a significant increase in surrender
rates in all product lines. Group retirement products
experienced higher surrenders as the average participant age
increased and a greater percentage of these participants are
near retirement age and/or termination of service from their
employers. Individual fixed annuities surrender rates are higher
in 2005 primarily due to the shape of the interest yield curve
and the general aging of the

in-force

reserves.
However, less than 20 percent of the individual fixed
annuity reserves are available to surrender without charge. The
increase in individual variable annuity surrender rates
primarily reflects the higher shock-lapse that occurred
following expiration of the surrender charge period on certain

3-year

and

7-year

contracts
(including a large closed block of acquired business).
Reflecting a widespread industry phenomenon, this lapse rate,
much of which was anticipated when the products were issued, has
recently been affected by investor demand to exchange existing
policies for new-generation contracts with living benefits or
lower fees. In addition, partial withdrawals on certain variable
annuity products have increased as AIG has introduced features
designed to generate a stream of income to the participants. The
following chart shows the amount of reserves by surrender charge
category as of December 31, 2005.

A continued increase in the level of surrenders in any of these
businesses could increase the amortization of deferred
acquisition costs in future years and will negatively affect fee
income earned on assets under management. The combination of
reduced sales and increased surrenders and withdrawals resulted
in significantly lower net flows for total domestic Retirement
Services than in the prior year. AIG expects that net flows will
remain lower than in prior years as long as an environment of
lackluster equity market performance persists and the yield
curve remains flat. The following table reflects the net flows

The majority of the growth in Life Insurance &
Retirement Services GAAP premiums in Foreign Life operations was
attributable to the life insurance and personal
accident & health lines of business. Globally,
AIG’s deep and diverse distribution, which includes
bancassurance, worksite marketing, direct marketing, and strong
agency organizations, provides a powerful platform for growth.
This growth was most significant in Japan, where AIG has
benefited from a flight to quality and development of multiple
distribution channels. In Southeast Asia, AIG maintains
significant market share by offering an attractive and diverse
product line, distributed by its strong agency force. There has
been a continuing trend in Southeast Asia, as the insurance
market continues to develop, for clients to purchase
investment-oriented products at the expense of traditional term
or whole life products. For GAAP reporting purposes, only
revenues from policy charges for insurance, administration, and
surrender charges are reported as GAAP premiums. This product
mix shift contributed to the single digit growth rate in Foreign
Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums.

Also in Japan, AIG Edison Life has improved the quality and
productivity of its sales force resulting in higher sales and
improved new business persistency. AIG Star Life is growing
first year premiums as a result of new product introductions and
an expanded agency force, and is benefiting from growth in the
bank annuity market.

However, in March of 2006, Japanese tax authorities are expected
to announce a reduction in the amount of premium policyholders
may deduct from their Japanese tax returns for certain accident
and health products. These products are generally sold by
independent agents to corporate clients and thus represent a
specific niche market segment and not the mainstream accident
and health products sold by AIG in Japan. A reduction in the
amount of tax deduction related to these products will make them
less attractive to the market and will reduce the level of
future sales. In addition, a portion of existing policies may be
canceled, and depending on the duration of those policies and
other factors, could result in a write-off of deferred
acquisition costs. At the current time, management does not
believe that such losses, should they

occur, would be material to AIG’s consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Foreign Retirement Services business continues its strong
growth based upon its success in Japan and Korea by expanding
its extensive distribution network and leveraging AIG’s
product expertise. Somewhat offsetting this growth were the
negative effects on customer demand for certain multi-currency
fixed annuity products in Japan stemming from currency exchange
rate fluctuations. AIG is introducing annuity products in new
markets. In January 2005, AIG Star Life entered into an
agreement with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, one of Japan’s
largest banks, to market a multi-currency fixed annuity.

Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operations
produced 78 percent, 78 percent and 76 percent of
Life Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

AIG transacts business in most major
foreign currencies. The following table summarizes the effect of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of Life
Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP
premiums.

The growth in net investment income in 2005 and 2004 parallels
the growth in general account reserves and surplus for both
Foreign and Domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services companies. Also, net investment income was positively
affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested
net investment income along with the addition of new cash flow
from operations available for investment. The global flattening
of the yield curve put additional pressure on yields and
spreads, which was partially offset with income generated from
other investment sources, including income from partnerships.
Partnership income was $273 million and $192 million
for 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of first quarter 2004,
foreign separate accounts were transferred to the general
account per Statement of
Position

03-1,

resulting in increased net investment income volatility. The
positive effect of Statement of
Position

03-1

on
Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services net
investment income was $1.34 billion and $271 million
for 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts do not affect
operating income as they are offset in incurred policy benefits.

AIG’s domestic subsidiaries invest in certain limited
liability companies that invest in synthetic fuel production
facilities as a means of generating income tax credits. Net
investment income includes operating losses of approximately
$143 million, $121 million and $108 million,
respectively, for 2005, 2004 and 2003 and income taxes includes
tax credits and benefits of approximately $203 million,
$160 million and $155 million, respectively, for 2005,
2004 and 2003 from these investments. See also Note 12(k)
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements “Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities.”

Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating income
grew by 12 percent in 2005. Operating income for the AIG
Domestic Life insurance line of business was up 8 percent
and in line with the growth in GAAP premiums for the current
year, due in part to growth in the business base and improved
mortality results, offset by higher losses recorded in 2005 from
limited partnership investments in synthetic fuel production
facilities. Operating income for the home service line of
business declined as a result of the continued decline in
premiums in force and higher insurance and acquisition expenses,
combined with an increase in property casualty losses related to
hurricanes. The group life/health business and operating income
were affected by non-renewal of cases where acceptable margins
could not be achieved. In addition, 2005 results were affected
by reserve strengthening related to disability income products
totaling $12 million compared to reserve strengthening of
$178 million for Superior National and $68 million for
all other items in 2004. Operating income for the payout
annuities line of business increased 22 percent in line
with the growth in policy benefit reserves. The group retirement
products business recorded a modest increase in operating income
due primarily to higher variable annuity fee income and growth
in average reserves. Individual fixed annuity results are higher
than last year due primarily to 13 percent growth in
average reserves, higher surrender charges and reductions in
acquisition cost amortization expense resulting from increased
capital losses realized on bonds. Individual variable annuity
earnings are lower in 2005 when compared to 2004 principally due
to favorable deferred acquisition cost amortization variances
attributable to changes in assumptions and realized capital loss
activity in 2004.

Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating
income of $5.25 billion for 2005 included $84 million
of realized capital gains, and for 2004, operating income of
$4.85 billion included $372 million of realized
capital gains. Underwriting and investment results before the
effects of realized capital gains (losses) increased for all
lines of business. On this basis, the life insurance line of
business benefited in part from lower amortization of
acquisition costs for FAS 97 products, reflective of the
increasing investment yields for those portfolios, particularly
in Japan. In Southeast Asia, operating income growth
attributable to life insurance and deposit-based businesses was
partially offset by higher incurred policy benefit costs for
contributions to the participating policyholder fund in
Singapore, totaling $137 million, related to the settlement
of a long disputed local tax issue. Growth in the personal
accident & health line of business is generally in line
with the growth in premiums and reflects stable profit margins.
The group products business grew across all segments and
maintained profit margins. The largest contributor to the growth
in group products is the pension profit center which enjoyed
higher fee income emanating from higher assets under management
in Brazil and Southeast Asia. Growth in individual fixed
annuities, emanating primarily from Japan, is generally in line
with the growth in reserves and net spread rates were
maintained. The individual variable annuity line of business
also grew in line with the growth in reserves.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The contribution of Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operating income to AIG’s consolidated income
before income taxes, minority interest and cumulative effect of
accounting changes amounted to 58 percent in 2005, compared
to 53 percent in 2004 and 57 percent in 2003.

Underwriting and Investment
Risk

The risks associated with the life and accident & health
products are underwriting risk and investment risk. The risk
associated with the financial and investment contract products
is primarily investment risk.

Underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from
the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to
the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with
mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses. The emergence of
significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to
DAC and benefit reserves that could have a substantial effect on
AIG’s results of operations.

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other
catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIG’s
operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a
pandemic disease, such as the Avian Influenza A Virus
(H5N1), could adversely affect AIG’s business and operating
results to an extent that may be only minimally offset by
reinsurance programs.

While to date, outbreaks of the Avian Flu continue to occur
among poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in Asia,
parts of Europe, and recently in Africa, transmission to humans
has been rare. If the virus mutates to a form that can be
transmitted from human to human, it has the potential to spread
rapidly worldwide. If such an outbreak were to take place, early
quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment.

Both the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated H5N1 virus
that can be transmitted from human to human are highly
speculative. AIG continues to monitor the developing facts. A
significant global outbreak could have a material adverse effect
on Life Insurance & Retirement Services operating
results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity
rates.

AIG’s Foreign Life Insurance & Retirement Services
companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on
life insurance of a single life to approximately $1.7 million of
coverage. AIG’s Domestic Life Insurance &
Retirement Services companies limit their maximum underwriting
exposure on life insurance of a single life to $10 million
of coverage in certain circumstances by using yearly renewable
term reinsurance. See the discussion under “Liquidity”
herein and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for
AIG’s foreign life operations. This facilitates insurance
risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and
capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows
AIG to pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more
efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty
risk and relationships and manage global life catastrophe risks.

AIG’s domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance
relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate
capital management strategies. Pools of highly-rated third-party
reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess
of retention limits. AIG’s domestic life insurance
companies also cede excess, non-economic reserves carried on a
statutory-basis only on certain term and universal life
insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to AIG Life of
Bermuda Ltd., a wholly owned Bermuda reinsurer.

AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain
statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance
transactions. For this purpose, AIG entered into a
$2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility in
December 2004. Letters of credit totaling $2.17 billion
were outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and letters of
credit for all $2.5 billion were outstanding as of
December 31, 2005, all of which relate to life intercompany
reinsurance transactions. The letter of credit facility has a
ten-year term, but the facility can be reduced or terminated by
the lenders beginning after seven years.

In November 2005, AIG entered into a revolving credit
facility for an aggregate amount of $3 billion. The
facility can be drawn in the form of letters of credit with
terms of up to ten years. As of December 31, 2005 and as of
the date hereof, $1.86 billion principal amount of letters
of credit are outstanding under this facility, of which
approximately $494 million relates to life intercompany
reinsurance transactions. AIG also obtained approximately
$212 million letters of credit on a bilateral basis.

The investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting
from the cash flows from the invested assets, primarily
long-term fixed rate investments, being less than the cash flows
required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and
contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments.
See also the discussion under “Liquidity” herein.

To minimize its exposure to investment risk, AIG tests the cash
flows from invested assets and policy and contract liabilities
using various interest rate scenarios to evaluate investment
risk and to confirm that assets are sufficient to pay these
liabilities.

AIG actively manages the asset-liability relationship in its
foreign operations, as it has been doing throughout AIG’s
history, even though certain territories lack qualified
long-term investments or certain local regulatory authorities
may impose investment restrictions. For example, in several
Asian countries, the duration of the investments is shorter than
the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities.
Therefore, there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds
at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield
below that of the interest required for the accretion of the
policy liabilities. Additionally, there exists a future
investment risk associated with certain policies currently in
force which will have premium receipts in the future. That is,
the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a
yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.

In 2005, new money investment yields increased in some markets
and continued to decrease in others, leading to more frequent
adjustments in new business premium rates, credited

rates, and discontinuance of some products. In regard to the
inforce business, to maintain an adequate yield to match the
interest necessary to support future policy liabilities,
management focus is required in both the investment and product
management process. Business strategies continue to evolve to
maintain profitability of the overall business. As such, in some
countries, sales growth may slow for some product lines and
accelerate for others.

The investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the
proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active
management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory
investment quality and liquidity.

AIG may use alternative investments in certain foreign
jurisdictions where interest rates remain low and there are
limited long-dated bond markets, including equities, real estate
and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to
extend the duration or increase the yield of the investment
portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the
policyholder liabilities and DAC recoverability. This strategy
has been effectively used in Japan and more recently by Nan Shan
in Taiwan. Foreign assets comprised approximately
33 percent of Nan Shan’s invested assets at
December 31, 2005, slightly below the maximum allowable
percentage under current regulation. In response to continued
declining interest rates and the volatile exchange rate of the
NT dollar, Nan Shan is emphasizing new products with lower
implied guarantees, including participating endowments and
variable universal life. Although the risks of a continued low
interest rate environment coupled with a volatile NT dollar
could increase net liabilities and require additional capital to
maintain adequate local solvency margins, Nan Shan currently
believes it has adequate resources to meet all future policy
obligations.

AIG actively manages the asset-liability relationship in its
domestic operations. This relationship is more easily managed
through the ample supply of appropriate long-term investments.

AIG uses asset-liability matching as a management tool worldwide
to determine the composition of the invested assets and
appropriate marketing strategies. As a part of these strategies,
AIG may determine that it is economically advantageous to be
temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest
rate or other economic changes. In addition, the absence of
long-dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may
preclude a matched asset-liability position in those markets.

A number of guaranteed benefits, such as living benefits or
guaranteed minimum death benefits, are offered on certain
variable life and variable annuity products. AIG manages its
exposure resulting from these long-term guarantees through
reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments. See
Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of new accounting guidance for these benefits.

DAC for Life Insurance & Retirement Services products
arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with, and are
directly related to, the acquisition of new or renewal business.
Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are
generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period
of the policy. Policy acquisition costs which relate to
universal life and investment-type products, including variable
and fixed annuities (investment-oriented products) are deferred
and amortized, with interest, as appropriate, in relation to the
historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be
realized over the estimated lives of the contracts. Amortization
expense includes the effects of current period realized capital
gains and losses. With respect to universal life and
investment-oriented products, AIG’s policy, as appropriate,
has been to adjust amortization assumptions for DAC when
estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from
these contracts are revised. With respect to variable annuities
sold domestically (representing the vast majority of AIG’s
variable annuity business), the assumption for the long-term
annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the
determination of DAC amortization is approximately
ten percent. A methodology referred to as “reversion
to the mean” is used to maintain this long-term net growth
rate assumption, while giving consideration to short-term
variations in equity markets. Estimated gross profits include
investment income and gains and losses on investments less
interest required as well as other charges in the contract less
actual mortality and expenses. Current experience and changes in
the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the
effect on the amortization of DAC. The estimation of projected
gross profits requires significant management judgment. The
elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits
are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are adjusted accordingly.

AIG’s variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes
in market returns because separate account revenues, primarily
composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management
fees, are a function of asset values.

DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products
as well as retirement services products are reviewed for
recoverability, which involve estimating the future
profitability of current business. This review also involves
significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of
future profitability were to be substantially different than
that estimated, AIG’s results of operations could be
significantly affected in future periods. See also Note 4
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance and Asset Management Invested Assets

AIG’s investment strategy is to invest primarily in high
quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid
significant exposure to issuer, industry and/or country
concentrations. With respect to Domestic General Insurance,
AIG’s strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed
maturity investments to maximize the yields at the date of
purchase. With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement
Services, AIG’s strategy is to produce cash flows required
to meet maturing insurance liabilities. See also the discussion
under “Operating Review: Life Insurance &
Retirement Services Operations” herein. AIG invests in
equities for various reasons, including diversifying its overall
exposure to interest rate risk. Available for sale bonds and
equity securities are subject to declines in fair value. Such
changes in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation
or depreciation of investments, net of taxes, as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Generally, insurance

regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance
company may invest. When permitted by regulatory authorities and
when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets, including
invested assets, from adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, AIG and its
insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as
end users. See also the discussion under “Derivatives”
herein.

In certain jurisdictions, significant regulatory and/or foreign
governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate
free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the
insurance subsidiaries to AIG parent.

The following tables summarize the
composition of AIG’s insurance and asset management
invested assets by segment, at December 31, 2005 and
2004:

Credit Quality

At December 31, 2005, approximately 61 percent of the
fixed maturities investments were domestic securities.
Approximately 35 percent of such domestic securities were
rated AAA by one or more of the principal rating agencies.
Approximately six percent were below investment grade or
not rated.

A significant portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is
rated by Moody’s, S&P or similar foreign services.
Similar credit quality rating services are not available in all
overseas locations. AIG reviews the credit quality of the
foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments, including
mortgages. At December 31, 2005, approximately
19 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were
either rated AAA or, on the basis of AIG’s internal
analysis, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities
so rated. Approximately five percent were below investment
grade or not rated at that date. A large portion of the foreign
fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities
supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance.

Any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a
variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date.

Valuation of Invested Assets

AIG has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its
stated maturity, including those fixed maturity securities
classified as available for sale. Therefore, the decision to sell

any such fixed maturity security classified as available for
sale reflects the judgment of AIG’s management that the
security sold is unlikely to provide, on a relative value basis,
as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities
entailing comparable risks. With respect to distressed
securities, the sale decision reflects management’s
judgment that the risk-discounted anticipated ultimate recovery
is less than the value achievable on sale.

The valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market
value for each security. The source for the market value is
generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with the
exception of nontraded securities.

If AIG chooses to hold a security, it evaluates the security for
an other-than-temporary impairment in valuation. As a matter of
policy, the determination that a security has incurred an
other-than-temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss
recognition requires the judgment of AIG’s management and a
continual review of its investments.

In general, a security is considered a candidate for
other-than-temporary impairment if it meets any of the following
criteria:

-

Trading at a significant
    (25 percent or more) discount to par or amortized cost (if
    lower) for an extended period of time (nine months or longer);

-

The occurrence of a discrete
    credit event resulting in

(i)

the issuer defaulting
    on a material outstanding obligation; or

(ii)

the
    issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy
    laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised
    reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or

(iii)

the issuer proposing a voluntary
    reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange
    their claims for cash or securities having a fair value
    substantially lower than par value of their claims; or

-

In the opinion of AIG’s
    management, it is probable that AIG may not realize a full
    recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of
    one of the foregoing events.

Once a security has been identified as other-than-temporarily
impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by
reference to that security’s contemporaneous market price
and recorded as a charge to earnings.

As a result of these policies, AIG recorded other-than-temporary
impairment losses net of taxes of approximately
$389 million, $369 million and $1.0 billion in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

No impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was
significant to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or
results of operations, and no individual impairment loss
exceeded 1.0 percent of consolidated net income for 2005.

Excluding the other-than-temporary impairments noted above, the
changes in market value for AIG’s available for sale
portfolio, which constitutes the vast majority of AIG’s
investments, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income as unrealized gains or losses, net of tax.

At December 31, 2005, the fair value of AIG’s fixed
maturities and equity securities aggregated to
$409.8 billion. At December 31, 2005, aggregate
unrealized gains after taxes for fixed maturity and equity
securities were $10.5 billion. At December 31, 2005,
the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of fixed maturity
and equity securities were approximately $2.6 billion.

The effect on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will
be further mitigated upon realization, because certain realized
losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts,
or realization will result in current decreases in the
amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs.

At December 31, 2005, unrealized losses for fixed maturity
securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant
industry concentrations.

The amortized cost of fixed maturities
available for sale in an unrealized loss position at
December 31, 2005, by contractual maturity, is shown
below:

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the pretax
realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed
maturities and equity securities were $1.6 billion. The
aggregate fair value of securities sold was $51.7 billion,
which was approximately 97 percent of amortized cost. The
average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the
twelve months ended December 31, 2005 were trading
continuously at a price below book value was approximately three
months.

At December 31, 2005, aggregate
pretax unrealized gains were $16.1 billion, while the
pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds,
below investment grade bonds and equity securities were
$3.3 billion, $404 million and $257 million,
respectively. Aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect
to these securities, distributed as a percentage of cost
relative to unrealized loss (the extent by which the market
value is less than amortized cost or cost), including the number
of respective items, was as follows:

(a)

For bonds, represents amortized cost.

(b)

As more fully described above, upon realization, certain
    realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder
    accounts, or realization will result in a current decrease in
    the amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition
    costs.

As stated previously, the valuation for AIG’s investment
portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations, with
the exception of nontraded securities. AIG considers nontraded
securities to mean certain fixed income investments, certain
structured securities, direct private equities, limited
partnerships, and hedge funds. The aggregate carrying value of
these securities at December 31, 2005 was approximately
$62 billion.

The methodology used to estimate fair value of nontraded fixed
income investments is by reference to traded securities with
similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology. This
technique takes into account such factors as the industry, the
security’s rating and tenor, its coupon rate, its position
in the capital structure of the issuer, and other relevant
factors. The change in fair value is recognized as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.

For certain structured securities, the carrying value is based
on an estimate of the security’s future cash flows pursuant
to the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No.

99-20,

“Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial
Assets.” The change in carrying value is recognized in
income.

Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the
aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair
value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.

With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which
AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest,
AIG uses the equity method to record these investments. The
changes in such net asset values are recorded in income.

AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited
partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the
general partner or manager of each of these investments, the
accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis.

Each of these investment categories is tested to determine if
impairment in value exists. Various valuation techniques are
used with respect to each category in this determination.

Aircraft Finance

AIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations
of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new
and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign
airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of
commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for
financial institutions.

ILFC finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the
issuance of a variety of debt instruments. The composite
borrowing rates at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
5.00 percent, 4.34 percent and 4.53 percent,
respectively. See also the discussions under “Capital
Resources” and “Liquidity” herein and
Notes 2 and 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

ILFC’s sources of revenue are principally from scheduled
and charter airlines and companies associated with the airline
industry. The airline industry is sensitive to changes in
economic conditions, cyclical and highly competitive. Airlines
and related companies may be affected by political or economic
instability, terrorist activities, changes in national policy,
competitive pressures on certain air carriers, fuel prices and
shortages, labor stoppages, insurance costs, recessions, and
other political or economic events adversely affecting world or
regional trading markets. ILFC’s revenues and income will
be affected by its customers’ ability to react and cope
with the volatile competitive environment in which they operate,
as well as ILFC’s own competitive environment.

ILFC is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through
nonperformance of aircraft lessees, through owning aircraft
which it would be unable to sell or re-lease at acceptable rates
at lease expiration and, in part, through committing to purchase
aircraft which it would be unable to lease.

ILFC manages the risk of nonperformance by its lessees with
security deposit requirements, through repossession rights,
overhaul requirements, and closely monitoring industry
conditions through its marketing force. However, there can be no
assurance that ILFC would be able to successfully manage the
risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in
the airline industry. Approximately 90 percent of
ILFC’s fleet is leased to non-U.S. carriers, and this
fleet, comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline
industry, continues to be in high demand from such carriers.

ILFC typically contracts to re-lease aircraft before the end of
the existing lease term. For aircraft returned before the end of
the lease term, ILFC has generally been able to re-lease such
aircraft within two to six months of its return. As a lessor,
ILFC considers an aircraft “idle” or “off
lease” when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease
agreement or signed letter of intent. ILFC had no aircraft off
lease at December 31, 2005. As of March 10, 2006, all
new aircraft deliveries in 2006 have been leased, and
76 percent of 2007 new aircraft deliveries have been
leased. See also the discussions under “Capital
Resources” and “Liquidity” herein.

ILFC sold two portfolios consisting of 34 and 37 aircraft in
2004 and 2003, respectively, to two trusts connected to
securitization transactions. Certain of AIG’s Life
Insurance & Retirement Services businesses purchased a
large share of the securities issued in connection with these
securitizations, which included both debt and equity securities.

Management formally reviews regularly, and no less frequently
than quarterly, issues affecting ILFC’s fleet, including
events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft
values. Management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary,
based on these events and circumstances in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144 — “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (FAS 144). ILFC has not
recognized any impairment related to its fleet, as the existing
service potential of the aircraft in ILFC’s portfolio has
not been diminished. Further, ILFC has been able to re-lease the
aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that
would require an impairment

write-down.

the discussions under “Liquidity” herein.

Capital Markets

Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which
engages in a wide variety of financial transactions, including
standard and customized interest rate, currency, equity,
commodity and credit products and structured borrowings through
notes, bonds and guaranteed investment agreements. AIGFP also
engages in various commodity and foreign exchange trading, and
market-making activities.

As Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation, current
and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis
for predicting future performance. Also, AIG’s Capital
Markets operations may be adversely affected by the downgrades
in AIG’s credit ratings. See “Risk Factors —
AIG’s Credit Ratings,” in Item 1A. Risk Factors
for a further discussion of the potential effect of the rating
downgrades on AIG’s Capital Markets businesses.

AIG’s Capital Markets operations derive substantially all
their revenues from hedged financial positions entered in
connection with counterparty transactions rather than from
speculative transactions. AIGFP participates in the derivatives
and financial transactions dealer markets conducting, primarily
as principal, an interest rate, currency, equity, commodity,
energy and credit products business.

As a dealer in financial derivatives, AIGFP marks all derivative
and trading transactions to fair value daily. Thus, a gain or
loss on each transaction is recognized daily. Under GAAP, in
certain instances, gains and losses are required to be recorded
in earnings immediately, whereas in other instances, they are
required to be recognized over the life of the underlying
instruments. AIGFP economically hedges the market risks arising
from its transactions, although hedge accounting is not
currently being applied to any of the derivatives and related
assets and liabilities. Accordingly, revenues and operating
income are exposed to volatility resulting from differences in
the timing of revenue recognition between the derivatives and
the hedged assets and liabilities. Revenues and operating income
of the Capital Markets operations and the percentage change in
these amounts for any given period are also significantly
affected by the number, size and profitability of transactions
entered into by these subsidiaries during that


AIG

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

period relative to those entered into during the prior period.
Generally, the realization of trading revenues as measured by
the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the
gain or loss on AIGFP’s trading transactions is currently
reflected in operating income as the fair values change from
period to period.

Derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course
of Capital Markets operations. Therefore, income on interest
rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy and credit derivatives
is recorded at fair value, determined by reference to the mark
to market value of the derivative or their estimated fair value
where market prices are not readily available. The resulting
aggregate unrealized gains or losses from the derivative are
reflected in the income statement in the current year. Where
Capital Markets cannot verify significant model inputs to
observable market data and verify the model value to market
transactions, Capital Markets values the contract at the
transaction price at inception and, consequently, records no
initial gain or loss in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue
No.

02-03,

“Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts
Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy
Trading and Risk Management Activities”
(EITF

02-03).

Such
initial gain or loss is recognized over the life of the
transaction. Capital Markets periodically reevaluates its
revenue recognition under
EITF

02-03

based
on the observability of market parameters. The mark to fair
value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance
sheet in the captions “Unrealized gain on swaps, options
and forward transactions,” “Unrealized loss on swaps,
options and forward transactions,” “Trading
assets” and “Trading liabilities.” Unrealized
gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net
receivable by counterparty, and the unrealized losses represent
the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by
counterparty as of December 31, 2005. These amounts will
change from one period to the next due to changes in interest
rates, currency rates, equity and commodity prices and other
market variables, as well as cash movements, execution of new
transactions and the maturing of existing transactions. See also
the discussion under “Derivatives” herein and
Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Spread income on investments and borrowings is recorded on an
accrual basis over the life of the transaction. Investments are
classified as securities available for sale and are marked to
market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected
in accumulated other comprehensive income. U.S. dollar
denominated borrowings are carried at cost, while borrowings in
any currency other than the U.S. dollar result in
unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses reported in income.
AIGFP hedges the economic exposure on its investments and
borrowings through its derivatives portfolio. The requirements
under FAS 133 hedge accounting were not met for these hedge
transactions for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003. Thus, these hedges are marked to fair value with the
unrealized gains or losses reported in income.

Consumer Finance

Domestically, AIG’s Consumer Finance operations are
principally conducted through AGF. AGF derives a substantial
portion of its revenues from finance charges assessed on
outstanding mortgages, home equity loans, secured and unsecured
consumer loans and retail merchant financing. The real estate
loans include first or second mortgages on residential real
estate generally having a maximum term of 360 months, and are
considered non-conforming. These loans may be closed-end
accounts or open-end home equity lines of credit and may be
fixed-rate or adjustable rate products. The secured consumer
loans are secured by consumer goods, automobiles, or other
personal property. Both secured and unsecured consumer loans
generally have a maximum term of 60 months. The core of
AGF’s originations are sourced through its branches.
However, a significant volume of real estate loans are also
originated through broker relationships, and to lesser extents,
through correspondent relationships and direct mail
solicitations.

Many of AGF’s borrowers are non-conforming, non-prime or
sub-prime. Current economic conditions, such as interest rate
and employment, have a direct effect on the borrowers’
ability to repay these loans. AGF manages the credit risk
inherent in its portfolio by using credit scoring models at the
time of credit applications, established underwriting criteria,
and in certain cases, individual loan reviews. AGF’s Credit
Strategy and Policy Committee monitors the quality of the
finance receivables portfolio on a monthly basis when
determining the appropriate level of the allowance for finance
receivable losses. The Credit Strategy and Policy Committee
bases its conclusions on quantitative analyses, qualitative
factors, current economic conditions and trends, and each
committee member’s experience in the consumer finance
industry. Through 2005, the credit quality of AGF’s finance
receivables continues to be strong.

Overseas operations, particularly those in emerging markets,
provide credit cards, personal and auto loans, term deposits,
savings accounts, sales finance and mortgages.

Consumer Finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual
payments are not received. Credit loss exposure is managed
through tight underwriting controls, mix of loans, collateral,
and collection efficiency.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Continued

Financial Services operations for 2005,
2004 and 2003 were as follows:

(a)

Includes the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify
    for hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133, including the
    related foreign exchange gains and losses. For 2005, 2004 and
    2003, the effect was $(34) million, $(27) million and
    $49 million, respectively, in operating income for Aircraft
    Finance and $2.01 billion, $(122) million and
    $(1.01) billion in both revenues and operating income for
    Capital Markets.

(b)

Revenues are primarily from ILFC aircraft lease rentals.

(c)

Revenues, shown net of interest expense, are primarily from
    hedged financial positions entered into in connection with
    counterparty transactions and the effect of hedging activities
    that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
    FAS 133 described in (a) above.

(d)

Certain transactions entered into by AIGFP generate tax
    credits and benefits which are included in income taxes in the
    consolidated statement of income. The amount of such tax credits
    and benefits for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
    and 2003 are $67 million, $107 million and
    $123 million, respectively.

(e)

Revenues are primarily finance charges.

(f)

Includes $62 million of catastrophe related losses for
    2005.

Financial Services Results

Financial Services operating income increased in 2005 compared
to 2004 as well as 2004 compared to 2003. Fluctuations in
revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not
unusual because of the transaction-oriented nature of Capital
Markets operations and the effect of hedging activities that do
not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. Capital
Markets operating income was also negatively affected in 2004 by
the costs of the PNC settlement. See Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.

To the extent the Financial Services subsidiaries, other than
AIGFP, use derivatives to economically hedge their assets or
liabilities with respect to their future cash flows, and such
hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under
FAS 133, the changes in fair value of such derivatives are
recorded in realized capital gains (losses) or other revenues.

Financial market conditions in 2005 compared with 2004 were
characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield
curves across fixed income markets globally, some tightening of
credit spreads and equity valuations that were slightly higher.
AIGFP’s 2005 results were adversely affected by customer
uncertainty surrounding the negative actions of the rating
agencies and the ongoing investigations, as well as the negative
effect on its structured notes business of AIG being unable to
fully access the capital markets during 2005.

Financial market conditions in 2004 compared with 2003 were
characterized by interest rates which were broadly unchanged
across fixed income markets globally, a tightening of credit
spreads and higher equity valuations. Capital Markets results in
2004 compared with 2003 reflected a shift in product activity to
respond to these conditions.

The most significant component of Capital Markets operating
expenses is compensation, which was approximately
$481 million, $497 million and $616 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The amount of compensation
was not affected by gains and losses not qualifying for hedge
accounting treatment under FAS 133.

ILFC continued to see net improvements in lease rates, an
increase in demand for the newer, modern, fuel efficient
aircraft comprising the bulk of ILFC’s fleet, and an
increasing level of interest from traditional buyers,
third-party investors and debt providers for the purchase of
aircraft from ILFC’s extensive lease portfolio. During
2005, ILFC’s revenues and operating income also increased
as a result of adding more aircraft to its fleet and earning
higher revenues on existing aircraft. However, these increases
were offset by increasing interest rates, fewer aircraft sales,
and leasing related and other reserves.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, ATA Airlines and related
entities (ATA) filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On the basis of estimates of the
probable outcome of the ATA bankruptcy, ILFC recorded pre-tax
charges aggregating $54 million in the fourth quarter of
2004 to write down the value of the ATA securities and
guarantees.

Consumer Finance operations, both domestically and
internationally, did very well with increased revenues and
operating income. Domestically, the Consumer Finance operations
had a record year in 2005. The relatively low interest rate
environment contributed to a high level of mortgage refinancing
activity. Real estate finance receivables increased 21 percent
during 2005. Despite high energy costs, the U.S. economy
continued to expand during the year improving consumer credit
quality. Both AGF’s charge-off ratio and delinquency ratio
improved over prior years. However, AGF incurred charges of
approximately $62 million for the estimated effect of
Hurricane Katrina on customers in the Gulf Coast areas affected
by the storm. A new bankruptcy law went into effect in October
2005. Consumers, including some of AGF’s customers, filed
for personal bankruptcy protection under the old law in record
numbers in third quarter 2005 ahead of the new law’s
effective date. AGF does not anticipate a significant effect on
its earnings from this new law because 80 percent of its finance
receivables are real estate loans with adequate collateral and
conservative loan-to-value ratios.

Foreign Consumer Finance operations performed well, as the
operations in Poland, Argentina and AIG Federal Savings Bank
recorded strong earnings growth. The Hong Kong

businesses experienced solid loan and earnings growth in a
strengthening economy.

Financial Services operating income represented 28 percent
of AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2005.
This compares to 15 percent and 10 percent in 2004 and
2003, respectively. The increase in contribution percentage in
2005 compared to 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to the
fluctuation in earnings resulting from derivatives that did not
qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133 and the
reduction in General Insurance operating income in 2005.

Financial Services Invested
Assets

The following table is a summary of the
composition of AIG’s Financial Services invested assets at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. See also the discussions under
“Operating Review — Financial Services
Operations”, “Capital Resources” and
“Derivatives” herein.

As previously discussed, the cash used for the purchase of
flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of
ILFC’s debt financings. The primary sources for the
repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the
cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight
equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt.
During 2005, ILFC acquired flight equipment costing
$6.19 billion. See also the discussion under
“Operating Review — Financial Services
Operations” and “Capital Resources” herein.

At December 31, 2005, ILFC had committed to purchase
338 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2006 through
2015 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of
$23.3 billion and had options to purchase 16 new
aircraft at an estimated aggregate purchase price of
$1.5 billion. As of March 10, 2006, ILFC has entered
into leases for all of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2006,
65 of 85 of the new aircraft to be delivered in 2007 and 11 of
155 of the new aircraft to be delivered subsequent to 2007. ILFC
will be required to find customers for any aircraft currently on
order and any aircraft to be ordered, and it must arrange
financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment.
ILFC has been successful to date both in placing its new
aircraft on lease or under sales contract and obtaining adequate
financing, but there can be no assurance that such success will
continue in future environments.

AIG’s Consumer Finance operations provide a wide variety of
consumer finance products, including real estate mortgages,
credit cards, consumer loans, retail sales finance and
credit-related insurance to customers both domestically and
overseas, particularly in emerging markets. These products are
funded through a combination of deposits and various borrowings
including commercial paper and medium term notes. AIG’s
Consumer Finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk
of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates.
Over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans
which are substantially collateralized by the related properties.

With respect to credit losses, the allowance for finance
receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate
to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio.

Capital Markets derivative transactions are carried at market
value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not
readily available. AIGFP reduces its economic risk exposure
through similarly valued offsetting transactions including
swaps, trading securities, options, forwards and futures. The
estimated fair values of these transactions represent
assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows.
These transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if AIGFP were
required to sell or close out the transactions prior to
maturity. AIG believes that the effect of any such event would
not be significant to AIG’s financial condition or its
overall liquidity. See also the discussion under “Operating
Review — Financial Services Operations” and
“Derivatives” herein.

AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes, bonds and
GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of
securities, including securities available for sale, at market,
and derivative transactions. The funds may also be temporarily
invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell. The
proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities
available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to
resell have been used to fund the maturing GIAs or other AIGFP
financings, or invest in new assets. See also the discussion
under “Capital Resources” herein.

Securities available for sale is predominately a portfolio of
fixed income securities, where the individual securities have

Continued

varying degrees of credit risk. At December 31, 2005, the
average credit rating of this portfolio was AA+ or the
equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or
internal review. AIGFP has also entered into credit derivative
transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated
with $125 million of these securities. Securities deemed
below investment grade at December 31, 2005 amounted to
approximately $166 million in fair value representing 0.4
percent of the total AIGFP securities available for sale. There
have been no significant downgrades through March 1, 2006.
If its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer
significant default and the collateral held declined
significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default
swap counterparty failed to perform, AIGFP could have a
liquidity strain. AIG guarantees AIGFP’s payment
obligations, including its debt obligations.

AIGFP’s risk management objective is to minimize interest
rate, currency, commodity and equity risks associated with its
securities available for sale. That is, when AIGFP purchases a
security for its securities available for sale investment
portfolio, it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal
hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction
offset the payment terms of the investment security, which
achieves the economic result of converting the return on the
underlying security to U.S. dollar LIBOR plus or minus a spread
based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial
trade date. The market risk associated with such internal hedges
is managed on a portfolio basis, with third-party hedging
transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting
treatment is not achieved in accordance with FAS 133, the
unrealized gains and losses on the securities related economic
hedges are reflected in operating income, whereas the unrealized
gains and losses on the underlying securities resulting from
changes in interest rates, currency rates, commodity and equity
prices, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
When a security is sold, the related hedging transaction is
terminated, and the realized gain or loss with respect to this
security is then recorded in operating income.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as
collateralized financing transactions. AIGFP takes possession of
or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under
agreements to resell. AIGFP further minimizes its credit risk by
monitoring counterparty credit exposure and, when it deems
necessary, it requires additional collateral to be deposited.

AIGFP also conducts, as principal, trading activities in foreign
exchange, and commodities, primarily precious metals. AIGFP owns
inventories in the commodities, which it records at the lower of
cost or market, in which it trades and may reduce the exposure
to market risk through the use of swaps, forwards, futures, and
option contracts. AIGFP uses derivatives to manage the economic
exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from
adverse movements of interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates and commodity prices. AIGFP supports its trading
activities largely through trading liabilities, unrealized
losses on swaps, short-term borrowings, securities sold under
agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but
not yet purchased. See also the discussions under “Capital
Resources” herein and Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Trading securities, at market value, and securities and spot
commodities sold but not yet purchased, at market value, are
marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being
recognized in income at that time. These trading securities are
held to meet the short-term risk management objectives of
Capital Markets operations.

The gross unrealized gains and gross
unrealized losses of Capital Markets operations included in the
financial services assets and liabilities at December 31,
2005 were as follows:

The senior management of AIG defines the policies and
establishes general operating parameters for Capital Markets
operations. AIG’s senior management has established various
oversight committees to review the various financial market,
operational and credit issues of the Capital Markets operations.
The senior management of AIGFP reports the results of its
operations to and reviews future strategies with AIG’s
senior management.

AIGFP actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses,
while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business
opportunities. In doing so, AIGFP must continually manage a
variety of exposures including credit, market, liquidity,
operational and legal risks.

AIGFP held a large portfolio of privately negotiated financing
transactions with institutional counterparties in the United
Kingdom. Certain provisions in the UK Finance Bill that was
published by the House of Commons on March 22, 2005 caused
AIGFP’s counterparties to exercise early unwind rights and
terminate these transactions during the first and second
quarters of 2005. Although the unwinding of these transactions
did not cause AIGFP to suffer any losses, the unwinds did result
in AIGFP not realizing spread income that AIGFP expected it
would have realized had the transactions remained outstanding.
The aggregate reduction in 2005 operating income attributable to
such foregone accrual earnings was approximately
$75 million.

Asset Management Operations

AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety
of investment-related services and investment products including
institutional and retail asset management, broker dealer
services and spread-based investment business from the sale of
GICs. Such services and products are offered to individuals and
institutions both domestically and overseas.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

As discussed above, AIG Retirement Services operations are
reported with Life Insurance operations. Therefore, Asset
Management operations represent the results of AIG’s asset
management and brokerage services operations, mutual fund
operations and the foreign and domestic GIC operations.

Asset Management revenues and operating
income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

(a)

The effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting treatment under FAS 133 was
    $149 million, $313 million and $230 million for
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(b)

Includes the results of certain AIG managed private equity
    and real estate funds that are consolidated effective
    December 31, 2003 pursuant to FIN46R, “Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities”. For 2005 and 2004,
    operating income includes $261 million and
    $195 million of third-party limited partner earnings offset
    in Minority interest expense.

Asset Management Results

Asset Management operating income increased in 2005 as a result
of a diversified global product portfolio. The operating income
growth was driven by growth in institutional assets under
management and the associated fee revenue along with strong
realized gains on sales of real estate investments and
performance fees earned on various private equity investments.
The level of gains and performance based fees are contingent
upon various fund closings, maturity levels and market
conditions, and by their nature, are not predictable. Therefore,
the effect on the segment’s future earnings may vary from
period to period. The revenues and operating income with respect
to the segment are largely affected by the general conditions in
the equity and credit markets. The increases in full year
segment results were achieved despite the run-off of the
existing GIC portfolio and the delay in launching AIG’s
domestic matched investment program. GICs are sold domestically
and abroad to both institutions and individuals. These products
are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are
favorable. A significant portion of the GIC portfolio consists
of floating rate obligations. AIG has entered into hedges to
manage against increases in short-term interest rates. AIG
continues to believe these hedges are economically effective but
do not qualify for hedge accounting under FAS 133. As a
result, continued increases in short-term interest rates will
negatively affect operating income in this segment. A positive
benefit to realized capital gains (losses) will offset any
negative trend in operating income. GIC revenues include income
from SunAmerica partnerships supporting the GIC line of business
and are significantly affected by performance in the equity
markets. Thus, revenues, operating income and cash flow
attributable to GICs will vary from one reporting period to the
next. The decline in GIC operating income compared to 2004
reflects tighter spreads in the GIC portfolio, partially offset
by improved partnership returns. Spread compression has occurred
as the base portfolio yield declined due to an increase in the
cost of funds in the short-term floating rate portion of the GIC
portfolio, only partially offset by increased investment income
from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio.

In September 2005, AIG launched a $10 billion matched
investment program in the Euromarkets under which AIG debt
securities will be issued. AIG also expects to launch a matched
investment program in the domestic market which, along with the
Euro program, will become AIG’s principal spread-based
investment activity. However, in light of recent developments,
the timing of the launch of the domestic program is uncertain.
Because AIG’s credit spreads in the capital markets have
widened following the ratings declines, there may be a reduction
in the earnings on new business in AIG’s institutional
spread based funding business.

Asset Management operating income represented 15 percent of
AIG’s consolidated income before income taxes, minority
interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2005.
This compares to 14 percent and 11 percent in 2004 and
2003, respectively.

At December 31, 2005, AIG’s third-party assets under
management, including both retail mutual funds and institutional
accounts, was approximately $62 billion compared to
$51 billion at year end 2004. The aggregate GIC reserve was
$48.8 billion at December 31, 2005 compared to
$53.8 billion at year end 2004.

Other Operations

Other operations include AIG’s equity in certain partially
owned companies, the distributions on the liabilities connected
to trust preferred stock, as well as the unallocated corporate
expenses of the parent holding company and other miscellaneous
income and expenses. Other income (loss) amounted to
$(2.48) billion, $(560) million and
$(1.90) billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
AIG’s equity in certain partially owned subsidiaries
includes $312 million and $96 million in catastrophe
losses in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in the 2005
amount is approximately $1.6 billion for the settlements
described under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. See also
Notes 12(i) and 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Capital Resources

At December 31, 2005, AIG had total consolidated
shareholders’ equity of $86.32 billion and total
consolidated borrowings of $109.85 billion. At that date,
$99.42 billion of such borrowings were either not
guaranteed by AIG or were matched borrowings under obligations
of guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs), liabilities
connected to trust preferred stock, or matched notes and bonds
payable.

Borrowings

At December 31, 2005, AIG’s
net borrowings were $10.43 billion after reflecting amounts
that were matched borrowings under AIGFP’s obligations of
GIAs, matched notes and bonds payable, amounts not guaranteed by

and rating actions by the major rating agencies, see the
discussion under “Outlook” herein and “Risk
Factors — AIG’s Credit Ratings,” in
Item 1A. Risk Factors as well as Note 9 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2005, AIG did not issue any medium term notes, and
$555 million of previously issued notes matured.

On September 30, 2005, AIG sold $1.5 billion principal
amount of notes in a Rule 144A/ Regulation S offering,
$500 million of which bear interest at a rate of 4.700
percent per annum and mature in 2010 and $1.0 billion of
which bear interest at a rate of 5.05 percent per annum and
mature in 2015. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of
AIG and rank equally with all of AIG’s other senior debit
outstanding. AIG has agreed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate an exchange offer for the notes pursuant
to an effective registration statement within 360 days of the
date on which the notes were issued.

AIG intends to continue its customary practice of issuing debt
securities from time to time to meet its financing needs

and those of certain of its subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes, as well as for a matched investment program.

In September 2005, AIG entered into loan agreements with
third-party banks and borrowed a total of $600 million
under the loan agreements on an unsecured basis, $500 million of
which matures in August 2006 but can be extended by AIG for an
additional seven-month period and $100 million of which
matures in September 2006.

AIGFP uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and
GIA borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of
securities and derivative transactions. The borrowings may also
be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements
to resell. AIG guarantees the obligations of AIGFP under
AIGFP’s notes and bonds and GIA borrowings. See also the
discussions under “Operating Review,”
“Liquidity” and “Derivatives” herein and
Notes 1, 8, 9 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

AIGFP has a Euro Medium Term Note Program under which an
aggregate nominal amount of up to $10.0 billion of notes
may be outstanding at any one time. The program provides that
additional notes may be issued to replace matured or redeemed
notes. As of December 31, 2005, $3.48 billion of notes
were outstanding under the program, including $221 million
resulting from foreign exchange translation into
U.S. dollars. Notes issued under this program are included
in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table of borrowings.

AIG Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding), through the issuance of
commercial paper, helps fulfill the short-term cash requirements
of AIG and its subsidiaries. AIG Funding intends to continue to
meet AIG’s funding requirements through the issuance of
commercial paper guaranteed by AIG. The issuance of AIG
Funding’s commercial paper is subject to the approval of
AIG’s Board of Directors.

AIG and AIG Funding are parties to unsecured syndicated
revolving credit facilities aggregating $2.75 billion,
consisting of $1.375 billion in a

364-day

revolving
credit facility that expires in July of 2006 and
$1.375 billion in a five-year revolving credit facility
that expires in July of 2010. The

364-day

facility allows
for the conversion by AIG of any outstanding loans at expiration
into one-year term loans. The facilities can be used for general
corporate purposes and also to provide backup for AIG’s
commercial paper programs administered by AIG Funding. AIG
expects to replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior
to their expiration. There are currently no borrowings
outstanding under these facilities, nor were any borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

In November 2005, AIG and AIG Funding entered into a 364-day
revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount of
$3 billion, which can be drawn in the form of loans or
letters of credit. The credit facility expires in November 2006
but allows for the issuance of letters of credit with terms of
up to ten years and provides for the conversion by AIG of any
outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. The
facility can be used for general corporate purposes, including
providing backup for AIG’s commercial paper programs
administered by AIG Funding and obtaining letters of credit to
secure obligations under insurance and reinsurance transactions.
There are currently no loans outstanding under the facility, nor
were any loans outstanding as of December 31, 2005. As of
such dates, $1.14 billion was available to be drawn under
the facility, with the remainder having been drawn in the form
of letters of credit.

AIG is also a party to an unsecured

364-day

inter-company
revolving credit facility provided by certain of its
subsidiaries aggregating $2 billion that expires in October
of 2006. The facility allows for the conversion of any
outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. The
facility can be used for general corporate purposes and also to
provide backup for AIG’s commercial paper programs. AIG
expects to replace or extend this credit facility on or prior to
its expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding
under the inter-company facility, nor were any borrowings
outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

As of November 2001, AIG guaranteed the notes and bonds of AGC.
During 2005, $300 million of previously issued notes
matured.

ILFC fulfills its short term cash requirements through the
issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper
is subject to the approval of ILFC’s Board of Directors.
The commercial paper issued by ILFC is not guaranteed by AIG.
ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit
facilities aggregating $6.0 billion at December 31,
2005. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes
and also to provide backup for ILFC’s commercial paper
program. They consist of $2.0 billion in a

364-day

revolving
credit facility that expires in October 2006, with a one-year
term out option, $2.0 billion in a five-year revolving
credit facility that expires in October 2009 and
$2.0 billion in a

five-year

revolving
credit facility that expires in October 2010. ILFC expects to
replace or extend these credit facilities on or prior to their
expiration. There are currently no borrowings outstanding under
these facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2005.

ILFC was a party to two

180-day

revolving
credit facilities aggregating to $1.0 billion, each of
which expired in 2005.

At December 31 2005, ILFC had increased the aggregate
principal amount outstanding of its medium term and long-term
notes. The foreign exchange adjustment for the foreign currency
denominated debt was $197 million at December 31, 2005
and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2004. ILFC had
$13.13 billion of debt securities registered for public
sale at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005,
$8.66 billion of debt securities were issued. In addition,
ILFC has a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $7.0 billion,
under which $4.98 billion in notes were sold through
December 31, 2005. ILFC has substantially eliminated the
currency exposure arising from foreign-currency denominated
notes by economically hedging that portion of the note exposure
not already offset by Euro denominated operating lease payments,
although such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133. Notes issued under this program
are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table
of borrowings.

ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility (ECA) for
use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft
delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by

AIG

various European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate
varies from 5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these
amortizing ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of
the aircraft. At December 31, 2005, ILFC had
$1.2 billion outstanding under this facility. The debt is
collateralized by a pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of
ILFC, which holds title to the aircraft financed under the
facility.

In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured ECA for up
to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be
delivered through May 31, 2005. The facility has since been
extended to include aircraft to be delivered through
May 31, 2006. The facility becomes available as the various
European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for
aircraft based on a six-month forward-looking calendar, and the
interest rate is determined through a bid process. At
December 31, 2005, ILFC had $1.4 billion outstanding
under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities
are included in Notes and Bonds Payable in the preceding table
of borrowings.

In August 2004, ILFC received a commitment for an

Ex-Im

Bank
comprehensive guarantee in the amount of $1.68 billion to
support the financing of up to 30 new Boeing aircraft. The
initial delivery period from September 1, 2004 through
August 31, 2005 has been extended by ILFC to
August 31, 2006. ILFC did not have any borrowings
outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2005. From
time to time, ILFC enters into various bank financings. As of
December 31, 2005 the total funded amount was
$1.4 billion. The financings mature through 2010. One
tranche of one of the loans totaling $410 million was
funded in Japanese yen and swapped to U.S. dollars.

In December of 2005, ILFC entered into two tranches of junior
subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion. Both mature on
December 21, 2065, but each tranche has a different call
option. The $600 million tranche has a call date of
December 21, 2010 and the $400 million tranche has a
call date of December 21, 2015. The note with the 2010 call
date has a fixed interest rate of 5.90 percent for the
first five years. The note with the 2015 call date has a fixed
interest rate of 6.25 percent for the first ten years. Both
tranches have interest rate adjustments if the call option is
not exercised. The new interest rate is a floating quarterly
reset rate based on the initial credit spread plus the highest
of (i) 3 month LIBOR,
(ii)

10-year

constant maturity treasury and
(iii)

30-year

constant maturity treasury.

The proceeds of ILFC’s debt financing are primarily used to
purchase flight equipment, including progress payments during
the construction phase. The primary sources for the repayment of
this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow
from operations, proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and
the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt. AIG does not
guarantee the debt obligations of ILFC. See also the discussions
under “Operating Review” and “Liquidity”
herein.

AGF fulfills its short term cash requirements through the
issuance of commercial paper. The issuance of commercial paper
is subject to the approval of AGF’s Board of Directors. The
commercial paper issued by AGF is not guaranteed by AIG. AGF is
a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit facilities
which, as of December 31, 2005 aggregated to
$4.25 billion, consisting of $2.125 billion in a

364-day

revolving
credit facility that expires in July 2006 and
$2.125 billion in a five-year revolving credit facility
that expires in July 2010. The

364-day

facility allows
for the conversion by AGF of any outstanding loan at expiration
into a one-year term loan. The facilities can be used for
general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for
AGF’s commercial paper programs. AGF expects to replace or
extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration.
There are currently no borrowings under these AGF facilities,
nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

During 2005, AGF issued $5.44 billion of fixed rate and
variable rate medium term notes ranging in maturities from two
to ten years. As of December 31, 2005, notes aggregating
$17.74 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging
from 2006 to 2015 at interest rates ranging from
1.65 percent to 7.50 percent. To the extent deemed
appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its
effective borrowing with respect to these notes.

AGF’s other funding sources include private placement debt,
retail note issuances and bank financings. In addition, AGF has
become an established issuer of long-term debt in the
international capital markets.

In addition to debt refinancing activities, proceeds from the
collection of finance receivables will be used to pay the
principal and interest with respect to AGF’s debt. AIG does
not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF. See also the
discussion under “Operating Review — Financial
Services Operations” and “Liquidity” herein.

AIG Credit Card Company (Taiwan) and AIG Finance (Taiwan)
Limited, both consumer finance subsidiaries in Taiwan, have
issued commercial paper for the funding of their own operations.
AIG does not guarantee the commercial paper issued by these
subsidiaries. See also the discussion under

    currently not making payments until the occurrence of an
    insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments
    are conditional on survivorship, or (iii) the occurrence of
    a payment due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event out of
    AIG’s control. The determination of these liability amounts
    and timing of payment are not reasonably fixed and determinable.
    Significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include

    inflation, and future policyholder elections as to benefits.

The maturity schedule of AIG’s
other commercial commitments by segment at December 31,
2005 was as follows:

“Rating triggers” have been defined by one independent
rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of
which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or
more rating agencies. Rating triggers generally relate to events
which (i) could result in the termination or limitation of
credit availability, or require accelerated repayment,
(ii) could result in the termination of business contracts
or (iii) could require a company to post collateral for the
benefit of counterparties.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Continued

AIG believes that any of its or its subsidiaries’
contractual obligations that are subject to “ratings
triggers” or financial covenants relating to “ratings
triggers” would not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or liquidity.

As a result of the downgrades of AIG’s long-term senior
debt ratings, AIG was required to post approximately
$1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to
municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial
derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade,
AIG will be required to post additional collateral. It is
estimated that, as of the close of business on February 28,
2006, based on AIG’s outstanding municipal guaranteed
investment agreements and financial derivatives transactions as
of such date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior
debt ratings to ‘Aa3’ by Moody’s or
‘AA-’ by S&P would permit counterparties to call
for approximately $962 million of additional collateral.
Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for
substantial additional collateral, which could have a material
effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of
additional collateral that AIG would be required to post to
counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market
conditions, the market value of the outstanding affected
transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the
downgrade. Additional obligations to post collateral will
increase the demand on AIG’s liquidity.

Shareholders’ Equity

AIG’s consolidated shareholders’ equity increased
$6.64 billion during 2005. During 2005, retained earnings
increased $8.86 billion, resulting from net income less
dividends. Unrealized appreciation of investments, net of taxes,
decreased $1.98 billion and the cumulative translation
adjustment loss, net of taxes, increased $540 million.
During 2005, there was a gain of $28 million, net of taxes,
relating to derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging
instruments. See also the discussion under “Operating
Review” and “Liquidity” herein, Notes 1(ee),
8(d) and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

AIG has in the past reinvested most of its unrestricted earnings
in its operations and believes such continued reinvestment in
the future will be adequate to meet any foreseeable capital
needs. However, AIG may choose from time to time to raise
additional funds through the issuance of additional securities.

Stock Purchase

During 2005, AIG purchased in the open market 2,477,100 shares
of its common stock. AIG from time to time may buy shares of its
common stock in the open market for general corporate purposes,
including to satisfy its obligations under various employee
benefit plans. At December 31, 2005, an additional
36,542,700 shares could be purchased under the then current
authorization by AIG’s Board of Directors.

Dividends from Insurance
Subsidiaries

Payments of dividends to AIG by its insurance subsidiaries are
subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory
authorities. With respect to AIG’s domestic insurance
subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice
to the insurance department in which the particular insurance
subsidiary is domiciled. Under the laws of many states, an
insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the
insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below
certain regulatory thresholds. Largely as a result of the
restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated
shareholders’ equity was restricted from immediate transfer
to AIG parent at December 31, 2005. To enhance their
current capital positions, dividends from the DBG companies were
suspended in the fourth quarter of 2005, and AIG has taken
various other actions. See “Regulation and
Supervision” below. Furthermore, AIG cannot predict how
recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its
regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See “Risk
Factors — Regulatory Investigations” in
Item 1A. Risk Factors.

With respect to AIG’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, the
most significant insurance regulatory jurisdictions include
Bermuda, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Thailand
and Singapore.

AIG cannot predict whether the regulatory investigations
currently underway or future regulatory issues will impair
AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity. To AIG’s knowledge, no AIG company is currently
on any regulatory or similar “watch list” with regard
to solvency. See also the discussion under “Liquidity”
herein and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, as well as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.
Risk Factors.

Regulation and Supervision

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other
insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the
states and jurisdictions in which they do business. In the U.S.
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) has developed Risk-Based Capital
(RBC) requirements. RBC relates an individual insurance
company’s statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its
overall operations.

In connection with its Restatements, AIG examined and evaluated
each of the items that have been restated or adjusted in its
consolidated GAAP financial statements to determine whether
restatement of the previously filed statutory financial
statements of its insurance company subsidiaries would be
required. In October and early November 2005, AIG completed its
audited statutory financial statements for 2004 for all of the
Domestic General Insurance companies. The statutory accounting
treatment of the various items requiring adjustment or
restatement was reviewed and agreed to with the relevant state
insurance regulators in advance of the filings. Adjustments
necessary to reflect the cumulative effect on statutory surplus
of adjustments relating to years prior to 2004 were made to 2004
opening surplus, and 2004 statutory net income was restated
accordingly. Previously reported General Insurance

statutory surplus at December 31, 2004 was reduced by
approximately $3.5 billion to approximately
$20.6 billion.

AIG also recently completed its 2005 unaudited statutory
financial statements for all of its Domestic General Insurance
subsidiaries, again after reviewing and agreeing with the
relevant state insurance regulators the statutory accounting
treatment of various items. The state regulators have permitted
the Domestic General Insurance companies to record a
$724 million reduction to opening statutory surplus as of
January 1, 2005 to reflect the effects of the Second
Restatement.

Statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum
company action level requirements following the adjustments, but
AIG nonetheless contributed an additional $750 million of
capital into American Home effective September 30, 2005 and
contributed a further $2.25 billion of capital in February
2006 for a total of approximately $3 billion of capital
into Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries effective
December 31, 2005. To enhance their current capital
positions, dividends from the DBG companies were suspended in
the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG believes it has the capital
resources and liquidity to fund any necessary statutory capital
contributions. AIG will review the capital position of its
insurance company subsidiaries with various rating agencies and
regulators to determine if additional capital contributions or
other actions are warranted.

As discussed above, various regulators have commenced
investigations into certain insurance business practices. In
addition, the OTS and other regulators routinely conduct
examinations of AIG and its subsidiaries, including AIG’s
consumer finance operations. AIG cannot predict the ultimate
effect that these investigations and examinations, or any
additional regulation arising therefrom, might have on its
business. Federal, state or local legislation may affect
AIG’s ability to operate and expand its various financial
services businesses, and changes in the current laws,
regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material
adverse effect on these businesses. See “Risk
Factors — Regulatory Investigations” in
Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of the
effect these investigations may have on AIG’s businesses.

AIG’s U.S. operations are negatively affected under
guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states. As a
result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund
assessment laws, a solvent insurance company may be assessed for
certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other
insurance companies which operated in that state. AIG generally
records these assessments upon notice. Additionally, certain
states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be
used as a credit against a company’s future premium tax
liabilities. Therefore, the ultimate net assessment cannot
reasonably be estimated. The guarantee fund assessments net of
credits for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $124 million,
$118 million and $77 million, respectively.

AIG is also required to participate in various involuntary pools
(principally workers compensation business) which provide
insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in
the voluntary markets. This participation is also recorded upon
notification, as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated.

A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business
and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement
Services business are conducted in foreign countries. The degree
of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies.
Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating
in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory
requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG
subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus,
AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from
conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where
they currently operate. AIG’s international operations
include operations in various developing nations. Both current
and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by
unfavorable political developments up to and including
nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation.
Adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect
AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial
condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s
net financial exposure at that time in that country.

Foreign insurance operations are individually subject to local
solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of
adequate capitalization, which AIG complies with by country. In
addition, certain foreign locations, notably Japan, have
established regulations that can result in guarantee fund
assessments. These have not had a material effect on AIG’s
results of operations.

Liquidity

AIG’s liquidity is primarily derived from the operating
cash flows of its General and Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations. Management believes that
AIG’s liquid assets, its net cash provided by operations,
and access to short term funding through commercial paper and
bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated
cash requirements. See “Risk Factors — Access to
Capital Markets” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

At December 31, 2005, AIG’s consolidated invested
assets included $17.24 billion of cash and short-term
investments. Consolidated net cash provided from operating
activities in 2005 amounted to $25.14 billion.

The liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived
both domestically and abroad. The combined insurance operating
cash flow is derived from two sources, underwriting operations
and investment operations. Cash flow includes periodic premium
collections, including policyholders’ contract deposits,
cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries
less reinsurance premiums, losses, benefits, and acquisition and
operating expenses. Generally, there is a time lag from when
premiums are collected and, when as a result of the occurrence
of events specified in the policy, the losses and benefits are
paid. Investment income cash flow is primarily derived from
interest and dividends received and includes realized capital
gains net of realized capital losses. See also the discussions
under “Operating Review — General Insurance

Operations

Continued

Operations” and “Life Insurance & Retirement
Services Operations” herein.

With respect to General Insurance operations, if paid losses
accelerated beyond AIG’s ability to fund such paid losses
from current operating cash flows, AIG might need to liquidate a
portion of its General Insurance investment portfolio and/or
arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity
strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic
events occurring in a relatively short period of time.
Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments
sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market
place and/or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became
uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance
recoverable significantly decreased in value. See also the
discussions under “Operating Review — General
Insurance Operations” herein.

With respect to Life Insurance & Retirement Services
operations, if a substantial portion of the Life
Insurance & Retirement Services operations bond
portfolio diminished significantly in value and/or defaulted,
AIG might need to liquidate other portions of its Life
Insurance & Retirement Services investment portfolio
and/or arrange financing. Potential events causing such a
liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a
nation or region in which AIG Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations exist, nationalization, terrorist
acts, or other such economic or political upheaval. In addition,
a significant rise in interest rates leading to a significant
increase in policyholder surrenders could also create a
liquidity strain. See also the discussions under “Operating
Review — Life Insurance & Retirement Services
Operations” herein.

In addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash
flow, AIG’s insurance operations held $9.63 billion in
cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2005.
Operating cash flow and the cash and short-term balances held
provided AIG’s insurance operations with a significant
amount of liquidity. AIG subsidiaries have also issued debt
securities to fund insurance needs. In December 2005,
Transatlantic issued $750 million of debt securities in a
public offering, of which $450 million were purchased by
other AIG subsidiaries. Transatlantic contributed the proceeds
of the offering to a reinsurance company subsidiary.

This liquidity is available, among other things, to purchase
predominately high quality and diversified fixed income
securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity
securities, and to provide mortgage loans on real estate, policy
loans, and collateral loans. This cash flow coupled with
proceeds of approximately $139 billion from the maturities,
sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the
sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately
$165 billion of fixed income securities and marketable
equity securities during 2005.

AIG’s major Financial Services operating subsidiaries
consist of AIGFP, ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG. Sources of funds
considered in meeting the liquidity needs of AIGFP’s
operations include guaranteed investment agreements, issuance of
long-term and short-term debt, proceeds from maturities and
sales of securities available for sale, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, and securities and spot commodities sold
but not yet purchased. ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG all utilize the
commercial paper markets, retail and wholesale deposits, bank
loans and bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity. ILFC
and AGF also fund in the domestic and international capital
markets without reliance on any guarantee from AIG. An
additional source of liquidity for ILFC is the use of export
credit facilities. AIGCFG also uses wholesale and retail bank
deposits as sources of funds. On occasion, AIG has provided
equity capital to ILFC, AGF and AIGCFG and provides intercompany
loans to AIGCFG. An AIG subsidiary purchased additional shares
of ILFC in the amount of $400 million during the third
quarter of 2005. Cash flow provided from operations is a major
source of liquidity for AIG’s primary Financial Services
operating subsidiaries.

AIG, the parent company, funds its short-term working capital
needs through commercial paper issued by AIG Funding. As of
December 31, 2005, AIG Funding had $2.69 billion of
commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of
32 days. At February 28, 2006, AIG Funding had
$5.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an
average maturity of 24 days. As additional liquidity, AIG
parent has a $2 billion inter-company revolving credit
facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries, a
$1.375 billion 364-day revolving bank credit facility that
expires in July 2006, a $1.375 billion five year revolving
bank credit facility that expires in July 2010 and a
$3 billion

364-day

revolving credit facility that expires in November 2006, of
which $1.14 billion is currently available as back-up
liquidity. AIG parent’s primary sources of cash flow are
dividends and loans from its subsidiaries. Largely as a result
of regulatory restrictions, approximately 89 percent of
consolidated shareholders’ equity was restricted from
immediate transfer to AIG parent at December 31, 2005. AIG
cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect
the ability of its regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. See
“Risk Factors — Regulatory Investigations”
in Item 1A. Risk Factors. AIG parent’s primary uses of
cash flow are for debt service, capital contributions to
subsidiaries and the payment of dividends to shareholders. See
also Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on debt maturities for AIG and its
subsidiaries.

The capital contributions referred to under Item 1.
Business — Regulation and the settlements described
under Item 3. Legal Proceedings were funded using existing
capacity from internal and external sources, including the
issuance of commercial paper.

Special Purpose Vehicles and Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements

AIG uses special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and off balance sheet
arrangements in the ordinary course of business. As a result of
recent changes in accounting, a number of SPVs and off balance
sheet arrangements have been reflected in AIG’s
consolidated financial statements. In January 2003, FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (FIN 46). FIN 46 addressed the
consolidation and disclosure rules for nonoperating entities
that are now

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

defined as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). In December 2003,
FASB issued a revision to Interpretation No. 46
(FIN 46R).

AIG has guidelines with respect to the formation of and
investment in SPVs and off balance sheet arrangements. In
addition, AIG has expanded the responsibility of its Complex
Structured Financial Transaction Committee (CSFT) to include the
review of any transaction that could subject AIG to heightened
legal, reputational, regulatory, accounting or other risk. See
“Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting” in Item 9A of Part II for a
further discussion of the CSFT.

For additional information related to AIG’s activities with
respect to VIEs and certain guarantees see “Recent
Accounting Standards” herein and also Notes 1 and 19
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, for
additional disclosure regarding AIG’s commercial
commitments (including guarantors), see “Contractual
Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments” herein.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments among two or more parties
with returns linked to or “derived” from some
underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or
index. Derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and
exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, commodities,
financial or commodity indices, or other variables. The more
significant types of derivative arrangements in which AIG
transacts are swaps, forwards, futures and options. In the
normal course of business, with the agreement of the original
counterparty, these contracts may be terminated early or
assigned to another counterparty.

The overwhelming majority of AIG’s derivatives activities
are conducted by the Capital Markets operations, thus permitting
AIG to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting
primarily as principal. In these derivative operations, AIG
structures transactions that generally allow its counterparties
to obtain, or hedge, exposure to changes in interest and foreign
currency exchange rates, credit events, securities’ prices
and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices.
AIG’s customers — such as corporations, financial
institutions, multinational organizations, sovereign entities,
government agencies and municipalities — use
derivatives to hedge their own market exposures. For example, a
futures, forward or option contract can be used to protect the
customers’ assets or liabilities against price fluctuations.

A counterparty may default on any obligation to AIG, including a
derivative contract. Credit risk is a consequence of extending
credit and/or carrying trading and investment positions. Credit
risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a
positive fair value to AIG. To help manage this risk,
AIGFP’s credit department operates within the guidelines
set by the AIG Credit Risk Committee. This committee establishes
the credit policy, sets limits for counterparties and provides
limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having
different credit ratings. In addition to credit ratings, this
committee takes into account other factors, including the
industry and country of the counterparty. Transactions which
fall outside these pre-established guidelines require the
specific approval of the AIG Credit Risk Committee. It is also
AIG’s policy to establish reserves for potential credit
impairment when necessary.

In addition, AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements,
including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit
triggers, credit derivatives, and margin agreements to reduce
the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative
transactions. AIGFP requires credit enhancements in connection
with specific transactions based on, among other things, the
creditworthiness of the counterparties, and the
transaction’s size and maturity.

AIG’s Derivatives Review Committee provides an independent
review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except
those derivative transactions entered into by AIGFP with third
parties. The committee examines, among other things, the nature
and purpose of the derivative transaction, its potential credit
exposure, if any, and the estimated benefits.

FAS 133 requires that third-party derivatives used for
hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying
exposures to an outside third party and documented
contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In
most cases, AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with
respect to certain hedging transactions. Not meeting the
requirements of FAS 133 does not result in any changes in
AIG’s liquidity or its overall financial condition even
though inter-period volatility of earnings is increased.

See also Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for detailed information relating to AIG’s
derivative activities, and Note 1(ee) of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for AIG’s derivative
accounting policies.

Managing Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from
adverse fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies,
equities and commodity prices. AIG has exposures to these risks.

AIG analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques
including Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a summary statistical
measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of
market factors to AIG’s market positions. The output from
the VaR calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a
defined period of time given a certain probability. While VaR
models are relatively sophisticated, the quantitative market
risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and
parameters established in creating the related models. AIG
believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable
method of monitoring and controlling market risk. Therefore,
such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience
or judgment of senior management.

Insurance

AIG has performed a separate VaR analysis for the General
Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services segments
and for each market risk within each segment. For purposes of
the VaR calculation, the insurance assets and liabilities from
GICs are included in the Life Insurance & Retirement Services

AIG

segment. For the calculations in the analyses the financial
instrument assets included are the insurance segments’
invested assets, excluding real estate and investment income due
and accrued, and the financial instrument liabilities included
are reserve for losses and loss expenses, reserve for unearned
premiums, future policy benefits for life and accident and
health insurance contracts and other policyholders’ funds.

AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of
each of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004. The VaR number represents the
maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred
with a 95 percent confidence (i.e., only five percent
of historical scenarios show losses greater than the VaR figure)
within a one-month holding period. AIG uses the historical
simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and
liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a
specific historical time period. AIG uses the most recent three
years of historical market information for interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, and equity index prices. For each
scenario, each transaction was repriced. Portfolio, business
unit and finally AIG-wide scenario values are then calculated by
netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities.

The following table presents the VaR on
a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each
of AIG’s insurance segments as of December 31, 2005
and 2004. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is
always smaller than the sum of its components.

The following table presents the
average, high and low VaRs on a combined basis and of each
component of market risk for each of AIG’s insurance
segments for the years 2005 and 2004. Due to diversification
effects, the combined VaR is always smaller than the sum of its
components.

The Combined VaR and Interest Rate VaR for Life
Insurance & Retirement Services trended higher during
2004 because of growth in the Asian life businesses. The
December 2004 VaR results are equal to the maximum values
observed during the year.

During 2005, the Combined VaR and Interest Rate VaR for Life
Insurance & Retirement Services remained in a narrower
range. The December 2005 VaR results are somewhat lower than the
December 2004 figures because long-term interest rates in Asia
declined during the year.

In addition, the increase in Combined and Interest Rate VaRs
from 2004 to 2005 in the General Insurance division was caused
by growth in this business.

Financial Services

AIG generally manages its market exposures within Financial
Services by maintaining offsetting positions. Capital Markets
seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market
positions. Credit exposure is managed separately. See the
discussion on the management of credit risk above.

AIG’s Market Risk Management Department provides detailed
independent review of AIG’s market exposures, particularly
those market exposures of the Capital Markets operations. This
department determines whether AIG’s market risks, as well
as those market risks of individual subsidiaries, are within the
parameters established by AIG’s senior management. Well
established market risk management techniques such as
sensitivity analysis are used. Additionally, this department
verifies that specific market risks of each of certain
subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary.

ILFC is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair
value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse
fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, AIG statistically measured the loss of
fair value through the application of a VaR model. In this
analysis, the net fair value of Aircraft Finance operations was
determined using the financial instrument assets which included
the


AIG

10-K

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue, and the
financial instrument liabilities which included the future
servicing of the current debt. The estimated effect of the
current derivative positions was also taken into account.

AIG calculated the VaR with respect to the net fair value of
Aircraft Finance operations using the historical simulation
methodology, as previously described. For the years 2005 and
2004, the average VaR with respect to the net fair value of
Aircraft Finance operations was approximately $135 million
and $70 million, respectively.

Capital Markets operations are exposed to market risk due to
changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices.
AIGFP hedges its exposure to these risks primarily through
swaps, options, forwards, and futures. To economically hedge
interest rate risks, AIGFP may also purchase U.S. and foreign
government obligations.

AIGFP does not seek to manage the market risk of each
transaction through an individual third-party offsetting
transaction. Rather, AIGFP takes a portfolio approach to the
management of its market risk exposures. AIGFP values the
predominant portion of its market-sensitive transactions by
marking them to market currently through income. A smaller
portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon an
extrapolation of market factors. There is another limited
portion of transactions where the initial fair value is not
recorded through income currently and gains or losses are
recognized over the life of the transactions. These valuations
represent an assessment of the present values of expected future
cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed
appropriate by AIGFP and AIG management.

The recorded values of these transactions may be different from
the values that might be realized if AIGFP were required to sell
or close out the transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes
that such differences are not significant to financial condition
or liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized
when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity.

AIGFP attempts to secure reliable and independent current market
prices, such as published exchange prices, external subscription
services such as from Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker
quotes for use in this model. When such prices are not
available, AIGFP uses an internal methodology which includes
extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to
the dates of the transactions. Historically, actual results have
not materially deviated from these models in any material
respect.

Systems used by Capital Markets operations can monitor each
unit’s respective market positions on an intraday basis.
AIGFP operates in major business centers overseas and therefore
is open for business essentially 24 hours a day. Thus, the
market exposure and offset strategies are monitored, reviewed
and coordinated around the clock.

AIGFP applies various testing techniques which reflect
significant potential market movements in interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices, volatility
levels, and the effect of time. These techniques vary by
currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting
the derivatives portfolio. The results from these analyses are
regularly reviewed by AIG management.

As described above, Capital Markets operations are exposed to
the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and
commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon. AIG
statistically measures the losses of fair value through the
application of a VaR model across Capital Markets.

Capital Markets asset and liability portfolios for which the VaR
analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange
traded investments, derivative instruments and commodities.
Because the market risk with respect to securities available for
sale, at market, is substantially hedged, segregation of market
sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was
not deemed necessary. The VaR calculation is unaffected by the
accounting treatment of hedged transactions under FAS 133.

In the calculation of VaR for Capital Markets operations, AIG
uses the same historical simulation methodology, described under
Insurance above, which entails repricing all assets and
liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a
specific historical time period. In 2004, AIGFP enhanced its
library of factors by including implied option volatilities to
construct the historical scenarios for simulation.

The following table presents the VaR on
a combined basis and of each component of market risk for
Capital Markets operations as of December 31, 2005 and
2004. Due to diversification effects, the combined VaR is always
smaller than the sum of its components.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

American International Group, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of American International
Group, Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and

financial statement schedules

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of American International Group, Inc. and
its subsidiaries (AIG) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
AIG’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial
statements, AIG changed its accounting for certain
non-traditional long duration contracts and for separate
accounts as of January 1, 2004.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, we have audited management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that AIG did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005 because of the effect of the material
weaknesses relating to (1) controls over certain balance
sheet reconciliations, (2) controls over the accounting for
certain derivative transactions and (3) controls over
income tax accounting, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). AIG’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of AIG’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of
December 31, 2005, the following material weaknesses have
been identified and included in management’s assessment.

Controls over certain balance sheet
reconciliations:

AIG did not maintain effective
controls to ensure the accuracy of certain balance sheet
accounts in certain key segments of AIG’s operations,
principally in the Domestic Brokerage Group. Specifically,
accounting personnel did not perform timely reconciliations and
did not properly resolve reconciling items for premium
receivables, reinsurance recoverables and in-

tercompany accounts. As a result, premiums and other
considerations, incurred policy losses and benefits, insurance
acquisition and other operating expenses, premiums and insurance
balances receivable, reinsurance assets, reserve for losses and
loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, other assets and
retained earnings were misstated under GAAP.

Controls over the accounting for certain derivative
transactions:

AIG did not maintain effective controls
over the evaluation and documentation of whether certain
derivative transactions qualified under GAAP for hedge
accounting. As a result, net investment income, realized capital
gains (losses), other revenues, accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) and related balance sheet accounts were misstated
under GAAP.

Controls over income tax accounting:

AIG did not
maintain effective controls over the determination and reporting
of certain components of the provision for income taxes and
related deferred income tax balances. Specifically, AIG did not
maintain effective controls to review and monitor the accuracy
of the components of the income tax provision calculations and
related income tax balances and to monitor the differences
between the income tax basis and the financial reporting basis
of assets and liabilities to effectively reconcile the
differences to the deferred income tax balances. As a result,
income tax expense, income taxes payable, deferred income tax
assets and liabilities, retained earnings and accumulated other
comprehensive income were misstated under GAAP.

The control deficiencies described above resulted in the
restatement in 2005 of AIG’s 2004, 2003 and 2002 annual
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules and the interim consolidated financial statements for
each quarter in 2004 and 2003 and for each of the first three
quarters in 2005. In addition, these control deficiencies could
result in other misstatements to the aforementioned financial
statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a
material misstatement to the annual or interim AIG consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, AIG management has concluded that these control
deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. These material
weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing,
and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005
consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the
effectiveness of AIG’s internal control over financial
reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AIG did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.
Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material
weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives
of the control criteria, AIG has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the COSO.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

(a) Principles of Consolidation:

Certain of
AIG’s foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated
financial statements report on a fiscal year ending
November 30. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of AIG, its majority owned subsidiaries and those
entities required to be consolidated under applicable accounting
standards. See also Note 1(gg) herein. All material
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

(b) Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared on the basis of U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

General Insurance Operations:

AIG’s General
Insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing
substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance both
domestically and abroad. Premiums are earned primarily on a pro
rata basis over the term of the related coverage. The reserve
for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written
relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.

Acquisition costs represent those costs, including commissions
and premium taxes, that vary with and are primarily related to
the acquisition of new business. These costs are deferred and
amortized over the period in which the related premiums written
are earned. The deferred policy acquisition cost
(DAC) asset is reviewed for recoverability based on the
profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment
income is not anticipated in the recoverability of deferred
policy acquisition costs.

Losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The
reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation
of estimates for reported losses and includes provisions for
losses incurred but not reported. The methods of determining
such estimates and establishing resulting reserves, including
amounts relating to reserves for estimated unrecoverable
reinsurance, are reviewed and updated. Adjustments resulting
therefrom are reflected in income currently. AIG discounts its
loss reserves relating to workers compensation business written
by its U.S. domiciled subsidiaries as permitted by the
domiciliary statutory regulatory authorities. As of year end
2005, this discount is $512 million on a tabular basis and
$1.11 billion on a non-tabular basis. Additionally, AIG
discounts liability business assumed by American International
Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (AIRCO) from the Domestic Brokerage
Group (DBG) as permitted by its domiciliary regulatory
authority. As of year end 2005, this discount is
$490 million. The total amount of discount is
$2.11 billion or less than three percent of outstanding
loss reserves as reflected on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services Operations:

AIG’s Life Insurance & Retirement Services
subsidiaries offer a wide range of insurance and retirement
savings products both domestically and abroad.
Insurance-oriented products consist of individual and group
life, payout annuities, endowment, and accident and health
policies. Retirement savings-oriented products consist generally
of fixed and variable annuities.

Premiums for life insurance products and life contingent
annuities are recognized as revenues when due. Estimates for
premiums due but not yet collected are accrued. Benefits and
expenses are provided against such revenues to recognize profits
over the estimated life of the policies. Revenues for universal
life and investment-type products consist of policy charges for
the cost of insurance, administration, and surrenders during the
period. Policy charges collected with respect to future services
are deferred and recognized in a manner similar to the deferred
policy acquisition costs related to such products. Expenses
include interest credited to policy account balances and benefit
payments made in excess of policy account balances. Personal
accident products are accounted for in a manner similar to
general insurance products described above.

Policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are
generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period
of the policy Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 60, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises” (FAS 60). Policy acquisition costs and
policy issuance costs related to universal life and
investment-type products (investment-oriented products) are
deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the
incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the
estimated lives of the contracts under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting
by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and
for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments”
(FAS 97). Estimated gross profits are composed of net
interest income, net realized investment gains and losses, fees,
surrender charges, expenses, and mortality and morbidity gains
and losses.

The resulting DAC asset is reviewed for recoverability based on
the profitability (both current and projected future) of the
underlying insurance contracts.

The deferred policy acquisition costs for investment-oriented
products are adjusted with respect to estimated gross profits as
a result of changes in the net unrealized gains or losses on
debt and equity securities available for sale. That is, as debt
and equity securities available for sale are carried at
aggregate fair value, an adjustment is made to deferred policy
acquisition costs equal to the change in amortization that would
have been recorded if such securities had been sold at their
stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at
current yields. The change in this adjustment, net of tax, is
included with the change in net unrealized gains/losses on debt
and equity securities available for sale that is credited or
charged directly to comprehensive income. Deferred policy
acquisition costs have been decreased by $1.14 billion at
December 31, 2005 and decreased by $2.26 billion at
December 31, 2004 for this adjustment. See also Note 4
herein.

Value of Business Acquired (VOBA) is determined at time of
acquisition. This value is based on present value of future

AIG

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

Accounting Policies

Continued

pre-tax profits discounted at current yields applicable at time
of purchase. For products accounted under FAS 60, the VOBA
is amortized over the life of the business similar to that for
Deferred Acquisition Costs based on the assumptions at purchase.
For FAS 97 products, the VOBA is amortized in relation to
the estimated gross profits to date for each period. No
impairments have occurred for acquired business to date.

The liabilities for future policy benefits and
policyholders’ contract deposits are established using
assumptions described in Note 6.

Financial Services:

AIG’s Financial Services
subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft
and equipment leasing, capital markets transactions, consumer
finance and insurance premium financing.

AIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations
of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), which
generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used
commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines.
Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for
its own account, for airlines and for financial institutions.

ILFC, as lessor, leases flight equipment principally under
operating leases. Accordingly, income is recognized over the
life of the lease as rentals become receivable under the
provisions of the lease or, in the case of leases with varying
payments, under the straight-line method over the noncancelable
term of the lease. In certain cases, leases provide for
additional payments contingent on usage. Rental income is
recognized at the time such usage occurs less a provision for
future contractual aircraft maintenance. ILFC is also a
remarketer of flight equipment for its own account and for
airlines and financial institutions and provides, for a fee,
fleet management services to certain third-party operators.
ILFC’s revenues from such operations consist of net gains
on sales of flight equipment, commissions and management service
fees.

The Capital Markets operations of AIG are conducted through AIG
Financial Products Corp. and AIG Trading Group, Inc. and their
respective subsidiaries (collectively referred to as AIGFP),
which engages as principal in standard and customized interest
rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy and credit products
with top-tier corporations, financial institutions, governments,
agencies, institutional investors, and high-net-worth
individuals throughout the world. AIGFP also raises funds
through municipal reinvestment contracts and other private and
public securities offerings, investing the proceeds in a
diversified portfolio of high grade securities and derivative
transactions. AIGFP owns inventories in the commodities in which
it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the
use of swaps, forwards, futures, and option contracts. See also
Note 2 herein.

Consumer Finance operations include American General Finance,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (AGF) as well as AIG Consumer Finance
Group, Inc. (AIGCFG). AGF provides a wide variety of consumer
finance products, including non-conforming real estate
mortgages, consumer loans, retail sales finance and
credit-related insurance to customers in the United States.
AIGCFG, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a
multi-product consumer finance business with an emphasis on
emerging markets. See also Note 2 herein.

Finance charges are recognized as revenue using the interest
method. Revenue ceases to be accrued when contractual payments
are not received for four consecutive months for loans and
retail sales contracts, and for six months for revolving retail
accounts and private label receivables. Extension fees, late
charges, and prepayment penalties are recognized as revenue when
received.

Direct costs of originating loans, net of nonrefundable points
and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of
the related loans. The amount deferred is recognized as an
adjustment to finance charge revenues, using the interest method
applied on a pool basis over a term that anticipates
prepayments. If loans are prepaid, any remaining deferral is
charged or credited to revenue.

The allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a
level considered adequate to absorb estimated credit losses in
the existing portfolio. The portfolio is periodically evaluated
on a pooled basis and factors such as economic conditions,
portfolio composition, and loss and delinquency experience are
considered in the evaluation of the allowance.

Foreclosure proceedings are initiated on real estate loans when
four monthly installments are past due, and these loans are
charged off at foreclosure. All other finance receivables are
charged off when minimal or no collections have been made for
six months.

Together, the Aircraft Finance, Capital Markets and Consumer
Finance operations generate the vast majority of the revenues
produced by AIG’s consolidated Financial Services
operations.

Imperial A.I. Credit Companies also contribute to Financial
Services income. This operation engages principally in insurance
premium financing for both AIG’s customers and those of
other insurers.

Asset Management Operations:

AIG’s Asset Management
operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related
services and investment products including institutional and
retail asset management, broker dealer services and spread-based
investment business from the sale of guaranteed investment
contracts, also known as funding agreements (GICs). Such
products and services are offered to individuals and
institutions both domestically and overseas. The fees generated
with respect to Asset Management operations are recognized as
revenues when earned. Certain costs incurred in the sale of
mutual funds are deferred and subsequently amortized.

(c) Investments in Fixed Maturities and Equity
Securities:

Bonds held to maturity are principally owned by
the insurance subsidiaries and are carried at amortized cost
where AIG has the ability and positive intent to hold these
securities until maturity.

Where AIG may not have the positive intent to hold bonds and
preferred stocks until maturity and not classified as trading,
these securities are considered to be available for sale and
carried at current market values. Interest income with respect
to fixed maturity securities is accrued as earned.


AIG

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Continued

Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds are
treated as yield adjustments over their estimated lives or call
date, if applicable.

Bond trading securities are carried at current market values,
and changes in fair value are recorded in income currently.

Common and preferred stocks are carried at current market
values. Dividend income is generally recognized when receivable.

Unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity
securities and fixed maturities available for sale are reflected
as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of deferred
income taxes in consolidated shareholders’ equity
currently. Unrealized gains and losses from investments in
trading securities are reflected in income currently.
Investments in fixed maturities and equity securities are
recorded on a trade date basis.

Realized capital gains and losses are determined principally by
specific identification. AIG evaluates its investments for
impairment. As a matter of policy, the determination that a
security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value
and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of
AIG’s management and a continual review of its investments.

In general, a security is considered a candidate for
other-than-temporary impairment if it meets any of the following
criteria:

-

Trading at a significant (25
    percent or more) discount to par or amortized cost (if lower)
    for an extended period of time (nine months or longer);

-

The occurrence of a discrete
    credit event resulting in

(i)

the issuer defaulting
    on a material outstanding obligation; or

(ii)

the
    issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy
    laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised
    reorganization of insolvent enterprises; or

(iii)

the issuer proposing a voluntary
    reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange
    their claims for cash or securities having a fair value
    substantially lower than par value of their claims; or

-

In the opinion of AIG’s
    management, it is probable that AIG may not realize a full
    recovery on its investment, irrespective of the occurrence of
    one of the foregoing events.

Once a security has been identified as other-than-temporarily
impaired, the amount of such impairment is determined by
reference to that security’s contemporaneous market price
and recorded as a charge to earnings.

AIG also enters into dollar roll agreements. These are
agreements to sell mortgage-backed securities and to repurchase
substantially similar securities at a specified price and date
in the future. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there
were no dollar roll agreements outstanding.

(d) Mortgage Loans on Real Estate, Policy, and
Collateral Loans – net:

Mortgage loans on real
estate, policy loans, and collateral loans are carried at unpaid
principal balances. Interest income on such loans is accrued as
earned.

Impairment of mortgage loans on real estate and collateral loans
is based upon certain risk factors and when collection of all
amounts due under the contractual term is not probable. This
impairment is generally measured based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s
effective interest rate subject to the fair value of underlying
collateral. Interest income on such loans is recognized as cash
is received.

There is no allowance for policy loans, as these loans serve to
reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and
the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash
surrender value of the policy.

(e) Financial Services – Flight Equipment:

Flight equipment is stated at cost. Major additions,
modifications and interest are capitalized. Normal maintenance
and repairs, airframe and engine overhauls and compliance with
return conditions of flight equipment on lease are provided by
and paid for by the lessee. Under the provisions of most leases
for certain airframe and engine overhauls, the lessee is
reimbursed for costs incurred up to but not exceeding contingent
rentals paid to AIG by the lessee. AIG provides a charge to
income for such reimbursements based upon the expected
reimbursements during the life of the lease. Depreciation and
amortization are computed on the straight-line basis to a
residual value of approximately 15 percent over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets but not exceeding
25 years. ILFC’s management is very active in the
airline industry and remains current on issues affecting its
fleet, including events and circumstances that may affect
impairment of aircraft values (e.g. residual values, useful
life, current and future revenue generating capacity). Aircraft
in the fleet are evaluated, as necessary, based on these events
and circumstances in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 144 “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(FAS 144). FAS 144 requires that long-lived assets be
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by
comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted
net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These
evaluations for impairment are significantly affected by
estimates of future revenues and other factors which involve
some amount of uncertainty.

This caption also includes deposits for aircraft to be
purchased. At the time the assets are retired or disposed of,
the cost and associated accumulated depreciation and
amortization are removed from the related accounts and the
difference, net of proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss.

(f) Financial Services – Securities Available
for Sale, at market value:

These securities are held to meet
long-term investment objectives and are accounted for as
available for sale, carried at current market values and
recorded on a trade-date basis. This portfolio is hedged using
interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and equity
derivatives. The market risk associated with such hedges is
managed on a portfolio basis, with third party hedging
transactions executed as necessary. As hedge accounting
treatment is not achieved in accordance with

AIG

Statements

1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Continued

FAS 133, the unrealized gains and losses on these
securities resulting from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and equity prices are recorded in consolidated
shareholders’ equity while the unrealized gains and losses
on the related economic hedges are reflected in operating
income.

(g) Financial Services – Trading Securities,
at market value:

Trading securities are held to meet short
term investment objectives, including hedging securities. These
securities are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at
current market values. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected
in income currently.

(h) Financial Services – Spot Commodities:

Spot commodities are carried at lower of cost or market value
and are recorded on a trade-date basis. The exposure to market
risk may be reduced through the use of forwards, futures and
option contracts. Lower of cost or market value reductions in
commodity positions and unrealized gains and losses in related
derivatives are reflected in income currently.

(i) Financial Services – Unrealized Gain and
Unrealized Loss on Swaps, Options and Forward Transactions:

Interest rate, currency, equity and commodity swaps, swaptions,
options and forward transactions are accounted for as
derivatives recorded on a trade-date basis and are carried at
current market values or estimated fair values when market
values are not available. Unrealized gains and losses are
reflected in income currently, where appropriate. In certain
instances, when income is not recognized upfront under
EITF 02-03, “Issues Involved in Accounting for
Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities”,
(EITF

02-03),

income is
recognized over the life of the contract. Estimated fair values
are based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among
other things, current interest, foreign exchange, equity,
commodity and volatility rates. AIG attempts to secure reliable
and independent current market prices, such as published
exchange prices, external subscription services’ prices
such as Bloomberg or Reuters or third-party broker quotes for
use in its models. When such prices are not available, AIG uses
an internal methodology which includes interpolation and
extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to
the dates of the transactions. These valuations represent an
assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows
of these transactions and reflect market and credit risk. The
portfolio’s discounted cash flows are evaluated with
reference to current market conditions, maturities within the
portfolio, and other relevant factors. Based upon this
evaluation, it is determined what offsetting transactions, if
any, are necessary to reduce the market risk of the portfolio.
AIG manages its market risk with a variety of transactions,
including swaps, trading securities, futures and forward
contracts and other transactions as appropriate. Because of the
limited liquidity of some of these instruments, the recorded
values of these transactions may be different from the values
that might be realized if AIG were to sell or close out the
transactions prior to maturity. AIG believes that such
differences are not significant to the financial condition or
liquidity. Such differences would be immediately recognized in
income when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to
maturity.

(j) Financial Services – Trading Assets and
Trading Liabilities:

Trading assets and trading liabilities
include option premiums paid and received and receivables from
and payables to counterparties which relate to unrealized gains
and losses on futures, forwards, and options and balances due
from and due to clearing brokers and exchanges.

Futures, forwards, and options purchased and written are
accounted for as derivatives on a trade-date basis and are
carried at fair values. Unrealized gains and losses are
reflected in income currently. The fair values of futures
contracts are based on closing exchange quotations. Commodity
forward transactions are carried at fair values derived from
dealer quotations and underlying commodity exchange quotations.
For long-dated forward transactions, where there are no dealer
or exchange quotations, fair values are derived using internally
developed valuation methodologies based on observable and
available market information. Options are carried at fair values
based on the use of valuation models that utilize, among other
things, current interest or commodity rates, and foreign
exchange and volatility rates, as applicable.

(k) Financial Services – Securities Purchased
(Sold) Under Agreements to Resell (Repurchase), at contract
value:

Purchases of securities under agreements to resell
and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are
accounted for as collateralized borrowing or lending
transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or
repurchase amounts, plus accrued interest. AIG’s policy is
to take possession of or obtain a security interest in
securities purchased under agreements to resell.

AIG minimizes the credit risk that counterparties to
transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual
obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and
collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral
to be deposited with AIG when deemed necessary.

(l) Financial Services – Finance
Receivables:

Finance receivables are carried at amortized
cost which includes accrued finance charges on interest bearing
finance receivables, unamortized deferred origination costs, and
unamortized net premiums and discounts on purchased finance
receivables. They are net of unamortized finance charges and
unamortized points and fees. The allowance for finance
receivable losses is established through the provision for
finance receivable losses charged to expense.

(m) Securities Lending Collateral and Securities Lending
Payable:

AIG’s insurance and asset management
operations lend their securities and primarily take cash as
collateral with respect to the securities lent. Invested
collateral consists primarily of floating rate debt securities.
Income earned on invested collateral, net of interest payable to
the collateral provider, is recorded in net investment income.

Continued

The market value of securities pledged under securities lending
arrangements were $59.0 billion and $48.8 billion as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of these
amounts, $58.3 billion and $48.2 billion represent
securities included in bonds available for sale in AIG’s
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

(n) Other Invested Assets:

Other invested assets
consist primarily of investments by AIG’s insurance
operations in hedge funds and limited partnerships.

Hedge funds and limited partnerships in which AIG holds in the
aggregate less than a five percent interest are reported at fair
value. The change in fair value is recognized as a component of
other comprehensive income.

With respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which
AIG holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest or
less than five percent interest but AIG has more than a
minor influence over the operations of the investee, AIG’s
carrying value is the net asset value. The changes in such net
asset values accounted for under the equity method are recorded
in earnings through net investment income.

AIG obtains the fair value of its investments in limited
partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the
general partner or manager of each of these investments, the
accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis.

(o) Short-term investments:

Short-term investments
consist of interest bearing cash equivalents, time deposits, and
investments maturing within one year, such as commercial paper.

(p) Reinsurance Assets:

Reinsurance assets include
the balances due from both reinsurance and insurance companies
under the terms of AIG’s reinsurance agreements for paid
and unpaid losses and loss expenses, ceded unearned premiums and
ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health
insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts
related to paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses with respect
to these reinsurance agreements are substantially collateralized.

(q) Other Assets:

Other assets consist of prepaid
expenses, including deferred advertising costs, derivatives
assets at market value, and other deferred charges. Generally,
advertising costs are expensed as incurred except for certain
direct response campaigns, which are deferred over the expected
future benefit period in accordance with Statement of Position
93-7, “Reporting on Advertising Costs.” In instances
where AIG can demonstrate that its direct-response advertising,
whose primary purpose is to elicit sales to customers, can be
shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and that
results in probable future economic benefits are capitalized.
Deferred advertising costs are included in other assets, are
amortized on a campaign by campaign basis over the expected
economic future benefit period and reviewed regularly for
recoverability. The amount reported in other assets was
$915 million and $879 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The amount of expense amortized
into earnings was $272 million, $244 million and
$217 million, for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

(r) Deposit Liabilities:

AIG has entered into
certain insurance and reinsurance contracts, primarily in its
general insurance segment, which do not contain sufficient
amount and timing risk to be accounted for as insurance or
reinsurance. Accordingly, these transactions are recorded based
upon deposit accounting, and the premiums received, after
deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits
within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Net
proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate net
investment income. As amounts are paid, consistent with the
underlying contracts, the deposit liability is reduced.
Periodically, AIG evaluates the expected payments to be made
under each contract and adjusts the deposit liability through
earnings in the current period.

(s) Investments in Partially Owned Companies:

Generally, the equity method of accounting is used for
AIG’s investment in companies in which AIG’s ownership
interest approximates 20 percent but is not greater than
50 percent (minority owned companies). At December 31,
2005, AIG’s significant investments in partially owned
companies included its 24.3 percent interest in
IPC Holdings, Ltd., its 23.4 percent interest in
Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd., its 26 percent interest
in Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, Ltd., its 26 percent
interest in Tata AIG General Insurance Company, Ltd. and its
24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance
Co., Ltd. This balance sheet caption also includes investments
in less significant partially owned companies. The amounts of
dividends received from unconsolidated entities where AIG’s
ownership interest is less than 50 percent were
$146 million, $22 million and $13 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The undistributed earnings of
unconsolidated entities where AIG’s ownership interest is
less than 50 percent were $179 million, $445 million
and $320 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

(t) Real Estate and Other Fixed Assets:

The costs of
buildings and furniture and equipment are depreciated
principally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives (maximum of 40 years for buildings and ten years
for furniture and equipment). Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to income as incurred; expenditures for
betterments are capitalized and depreciated.

AIG periodically assesses the carrying value of its real estate
relative to the market values of real estate within the specific
local area, for the purpose of determining any asset impairment.

(u) Separate and Variable Accounts:

Separate and
variable accounts represent funds for which investment income
and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the
policyholders who predominantly bear the investment risk. Each
account has specific investment objectives, and the assets are
carried at market value. The assets of each account are legally
segregated and are not subject to claims which arise out of any
other

business of AIG. The liabilities for these accounts are
generally equal to the account assets.

(v) Financial Services – Securities and Spot
Commodities Sold but not yet Purchased, at market value:

Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased
represent sales of securities and spot commodities not owned at
the time of sale. The obligations arising from such transactions
are recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at market values.

(w) Liabilities Connected to Trust Preferred Stock:

Liabilities connected to trust preferred stock principally
relates to outstanding securities issued by AGC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of AIG. Cash distributions on such preferred stock
are accounted for as interest expense.

(x) Preferred Shareholders’ Equity in Subsidiary
Companies:

Preferred shareholders’ equity in subsidiary
companies relates principally to outstanding preferred stock or
interest of ILFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG. Cash
distributions on such preferred stock or interest are accounted
for as interest expense.

(y) Other Policyholders’ Funds:

Other
policyholders’ funds are reported at cost and include any
policyholders’ funds on deposit which encompasses premium
deposits and similar items.

(z) Other Liabilities:

Other liabilities consist of
other funds on deposits, derivatives liabilities at market
value, and other payables.

(aa) Short- and Long-Term Borrowings:

AIG’s
funding is principally obtained from medium-term and long-term
borrowings. Commercial paper, when issued at a discount, is
recorded at the proceeds received and accreted to its par value.
Long-term borrowings are carried at the principal amount
borrowed, net of unamortized discounts or premiums. See
Note 9 herein for additional information.

(bb) Translation of Foreign Currencies:

Financial
statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, “Foreign
Currency Translation” (FAS 52). Under FAS 52,
functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars generally using current rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective
subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded
as a separate component of comprehensive income, net of any
related taxes, in consolidated shareholders’ equity.
Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local
operating environment. Income statement accounts expressed in
functional currencies are translated using average exchange
rates. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial
statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary
economies are recorded in income. Exchange gains and losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in
income currently. The exchange gain or loss with respect to
utilization of qualifying foreign exchange hedging activities is
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In the
situation where the qualifying hedge is identified to an
underlying foreign currency transaction, the hedging activity
exchange or loss is transferred out of other comprehensive
income and netted against the exchange gain or loss of the
underlying in income.

(cc) Income Taxes:

Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded for the effects of temporary
differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and
its reported amount in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
AIG assesses its ability to realize deferred tax assets
primarily based on the earnings history, the future earnings
potential, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and
the tax planning strategies available to the legal entities
recognizing deferred tax assets, all through which realization
of deferred tax assets will be achieved, as discussed in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.” See Note 3 herein
for further discussion of income taxes.

(dd) Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per common
share are based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock
dividends and stock splits. Diluted earnings per share are based
on those shares used in basic earnings per share plus shares
that would have been outstanding assuming issuance of common
shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding,
retroactively adjusted to reflect all stock dividends and stock
splits.

The computation of earnings per share
for December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as

(b)

Certain shares arising from employee stock plans were not
    included in the computation of diluted earnings per share where
    the exercise price of the options exceeded the average market
    price and would have been antidilutive. The number of shares
    excluded were 19 million, 7 million and
    26 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(ee) Derivatives:

AIG carries all derivatives in the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The financial
statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a
derivative depends on a number of factors, including the
intended use of the derivative and the extent to which it is
effective as part of a hedge transaction. The changes in fair
value of the derivative transactions of AIGFP are currently
presented as a component of AIG’s operating income.
However, in certain instances, when income is not recognized
upfront under
EITF

02-03,

income
is recognized over the life of the contract, where appropriate.

The discussion below relates to the derivative activities of AIG
(other than those of AIGFP) that qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133.

For derivatives designated as hedges, on the date the derivative
contract is entered into, AIG designates the derivative as:

(i)

a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair
value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized
firm commitment (“fair value” hedge);

(ii)

a hedge of a forecasted transaction, or the
variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); or

(iii)

a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign
currencies (“foreign currency hedges”). The gain or
loss in the fair value of a derivative that is appropriately and
contemporaneously documented, designated and is highly effective
as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings,
along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk. The gain or loss in the fair value of a
derivative that is appropriately and contemporaneously
documented, designated and is highly effective as a cash flow
hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings
are affected by the variability of cash flows. Of the amount
deferred in Other Comprehensive Income at December 31,
2005, AIG does not expect a material amount to be reclassified
into earnings over the next twelve months. The portion of the
gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative in a cash flow
hedge that represents hedge ineffectiveness is recognized
immediately in current period earnings. The amount of
ineffectiveness was not material for 2005, 2004 and 2003. The
gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is
appropriately and contemporaneously documented, designated and
is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation
adjustments account within other comprehensive income. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives used for other than hedging
activities are reported in current period earnings (principally
in realized capital gains and losses for AIG’s insurance
operations). AIG had no hedges that were considered fair value
hedges at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005,
AIG’s hedge accounting was limited to cash flow hedge
accounting primarily related to the hedge of forecasted
transactions.

AIG assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an
ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows of hedged items.

As of January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2005, the
related balance of accumulated derivative net loss arising from
cash flow hedges, net of tax, was $53 million and
$25 million, respectively. Of the change in accumulated
derivative net gain, $3 million represents current period
changes in fair values of derivatives used in cash flow hedge
transactions, and $25 million represents current period
reclassifications to operating income.

In addition to hedging activities, AIG also uses derivative
instruments with respect to investment operations, which
include, among other things, credit default swaps, and
purchasing investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity
linked notes and convertible bonds. All changes in the market
value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. AIG
bifurcates an embedded derivative where:

(i)

the
economic characteristics of the embedded instruments are not
clearly and closely related to those of the remaining components
of the financial instrument;

(ii)

the contract that
embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host
contract is not remeasured at fair value; and

(iii)

a separate instrument with the same terms as
the embedded instrument meets the definition of a derivative
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” See also Note 20 herein.

(ff) Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

Goodwill is
reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently
if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has
occurred. The assessment of impairment involves a two-step
process whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment
is performed, followed by a measurement of the amount of
impairment, if any. No impairment has been recorded by AIG in
2005, 2004 or 2003.

On August 29, 2003, AIG acquired 100 percent of the
outstanding common shares of GE Edison Life Insurance Company in
Japan and the U.S.-based auto and home insurance business of
General Electric Company (GE) for $2.1 billion. The
acquisition expanded AIG’s life insurance presence in Japan
and AIG’s auto and home insurance presence in the U.S. At
the date of acquisition, the fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed were $20 billion and
$19 billion, respectively. Goodwill associated with this
transaction as of December 31, 2003 amounted to
$1.3 billion, primarily related to the life business.

Other changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily
caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments
and other purchase price adjustments.

(gg) Recent Accounting Standards:

In December 2003,
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities Revised” (FIN46R). See also
Note 19 herein.

In March 2005, FASB issued
FSP

FIN46R-5

“Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation
No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”
(FSP

FIN46R-5)

to
address whether a reporting enterprise has an implicit variable
interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) or potential VIE
when specific conditions exist. Although implicit variable
interests are mentioned in FIN46R, the term is not defined and
only one example is provided.
FSP

FIN46R-5

offers additional guidance, stating that implicit variable
interests are implied financial interests in an entity that
change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net
assets exclusive of variable interests. An implicit variable
interest acts the same as an explicit variable interest except
it involves the absorbing and/or receiving of variability
indirectly from the entity (rather than directly). The
identification of an implicit variable interest is a matter of
judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances.
The adoption of
FSP

FIN46R-5

did
not have a material effect on AIG’s financial condition or
results of operations.

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants issued Statement of Position

03-1,

“Accounting
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
Accounts”
(SOP

03-1).

See
also Note 21 herein.

In December 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 132 (Revised), “Employers’
Disclosures About Pensions and Other Post Retirement
Benefits,” which revised disclosure requirements with
respect to defined benefit plans. See also Note 15 herein.

At the March 2004 meeting, the Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF)
reached a consensus with respect to Issue No. 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments.” On September 30,
2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF
No. 03-1-1, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF
Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”
delaying the effective date of this guidance until the FASB has
resolved certain implementation issues with respect to this
guidance, but the disclosures remain effective. This FSP,
retitled FSP
FAS

115-1,

“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments,” replaces the
measurement and recognition guidance set forth in Issue
No.

03-1

and
codifies certain existing guidance on impairment. Adoption of
FSP FAS

115-1

is
not expected to have a material effect on AIG’s financial
condition or results of operations.

At the September 2004 meeting, the EITF reached a consensus with
respect to Issue No. 04-8, “Accounting Issues Related
to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible Debt and the
Effect on Diluted Earnings per Share.” This Issue addresses
when the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt
(Co-Cos) with a market price trigger should be included in
diluted earnings per share (EPS). The adoption of Issue
No. 04-8 did not have a material effect on AIG’s
diluted EPS.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R).
FAS 123R and its related interpretive guidance replaces
FAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (FAS 123), and supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” (APB 25). FAS 123, as
originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a
fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based payment
transactions with employees. On January 1, 2003, AIG
adopted the recognition provisions of FAS 123. See also
Note 14 herein. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the
effective date for FAS 123R until the first fiscal year
beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, AIG expects to
adopt the provisions of the revised FAS 123R and its
related interpretive guidance in the first quarter of 2006. For
its service-based awards (1999 Stock Option Plan, 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan, and 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan), AIG
recognizes

compensation on a straight-line basis over the scheduled vesting
period. Upon adoption of FAS 123R, AIG will recognize
compensation expense to the scheduled retirement date for
employees near retirement. AIG does not expect the effect of
this change to be material to AIG’s results of operations.
Consistent with the requirements of FAS 123R, AIG will
recognize the unvested portion of its APB 25 awards as
compensation expense over the remaining vesting period.

In December, 2005 and January, 2006, C.V. Starr & Co.,
Inc. (Starr) made tender offers to AIG employees holding Starr
common and preferred stock. In conjunction with AIG’s
adoption of FAS 123R, Starr is considered to be an
“economic interest holder” in AIG. As a result, AIG
expects to include the compensation expense related to the 2006
tender offer in its consolidated financial statements for the
first quarter of 2006.

AIG is currently assessing the effect of FAS 123R and
believes the effect will not be material to AIG’s financial
condition or results of operations.

On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement
No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets —
An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29” (FAS 153).
FAS 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions.” The amendments made by
FAS 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of
the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the
narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have “commercial
substance.” Previously, APB Opinion No. 29 required
that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a
similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same
or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded
amount of the asset relinquished. The provisions in FAS 153
are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning
July 1, 2005. The adoption of FAS 153 did not have a
material effect on AIG’s financial condition or results of
operations.

On June 1, 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
(FAS 154). FAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20,
“Accounting Changes” and FASB Statement No. 3,
“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.” FAS 154 requires that a voluntary change
in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all
prior period financial statements presented on the new
accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so.
FAS 154 also provides that a correction of errors in
previously issued financial statements should be termed a
“restatement.” The new standard is effective for
accounting changes and correction of errors beginning
January 1, 2006.

At the June 2005 meeting, the EITF reached a consensus with
respect to Issue
No.

04-5,

“Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights”. The
Issue addresses what rights held by the limited partner(s)
preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole
general partner would consolidate the limited partnership in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles absent
the existence of the rights held by the limited partner(s).
Based on that consensus, the EITF also agreed to amend the
consensus in Issue
No.

96-16,

“Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When the
Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority
Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights.” The
guidance in this Issue is effective after June 29, 2005 for
general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for
existing limited partnerships for which the partnership
agreements are modified. For general partners in all other
limited partnerships, the guidance in this Issue is effective
beginning January 1, 2006. The effect of the adoption of
this EITF Issue on existing partnerships that were modified and
new partnerships entered into after June 29, 2005, was not
material to AIG’s financial condition or results of
operations. For all other partnerships, AIG is currently
assessing the effect of adopting this EITF Issue.

On June 29, 2005, FASB issued Statement 133
Implementation Issue No. B38, “Embedded Derivatives:
Evaluation of Net Settlement with Respect to the Settlement of a
Debt Instrument through Exercise of an Embedded Put Option or
Call Option.” This implementation guidance relates to the
potential settlement of the debtor’s obligation to the
creditor that would occur upon exercise of the put option or
call option, which meets the net settlement criterion in
FAS 133 paragraph 9(a). The effective date of the
implementation guidance is January 1, 2006. AIG is
currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance.

On June 29, 2005, FASB issued Statement 133
Implementation Issue No. B39, “Application of
Paragraph 13(b) to Call Options That Are Exercisable Only
by the Debtor.” The conditions in FAS 133
paragraph 13(b) do not apply to an embedded call option in
a hybrid instrument containing a debt host contract if the right
to accelerate the settlement of the debt can be exercised only
by the debtor (issuer/borrower). This guidance does not apply to
other embedded derivative features that may be present in the
same hybrid instrument. The effective date of the implementation
guidance is January 1, 2006. AIG is currently assessing the
effect of implementing this guidance.

On September 19, 2005, FASB issued Statement of
Position

05-1,

“Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred
Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges
of Insurance Contracts.”
SOP

05-1

provides
guidance on accounting for deferred acquisition costs on
internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts
other than those specifically described in FASB Statement
No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.” The SOP
defines an internal replacement as a modification in product
benefits, features, rights, or coverage that occurs by the
exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment,
endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a
feature or

coverage within a contract. The effective date of the
implementation guidance is January 1, 2007. AIG is
currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance.

On February 16, 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 155,
“Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments”
(FAS 155), an amendment of FAS 140 and FAS 133.
FAS 155 permits the Company to elect to measure any hybrid
financial instrument at fair value (with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings) if the hybrid instrument contains an
embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be
bifurcated and accounted for separately under FAS 133. The
election to measure the hybrid instrument at fair value is made
on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable.
FAS 155 will be effective for all instruments acquired,
issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the
beginning of the AIG’s fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted as of
the beginning of 2006, provided that financial statements for
any interim period of that fiscal year have not been issued. AIG
has not yet decided whether it will early adopt FAS 155
effective January 1, 2006, and is assessing the effect of
this change in accounting.

(hh) Restatements:

AIG has completed two

2. Segment Information

In 2003 and prior years, AIG’s operations were conducted by
its subsidiaries principally through four operating segments:
General Insurance, Life Insurance, Financial Services and
Retirement Services & Asset Management. Beginning with
the first quarter of 2004, AIG reports Retirement Services
results in the same segment as Life Insurance, reflecting the
convergence of protective financial and retirement products and
AIG’s current management of these operations. Information
for years prior to 2004 included herein has been reclassified to
show AIG’s results of operations and financial position on
a comparable basis with the 2004 presentation. These segments
and their respective operations are as follows:

General Insurance:

AIG’s General Insurance
subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially
all lines of property and casualty insurance both domestically
and abroad. AIG’s principal General Insurance operations
are as follows:

DBG writes substantially all classes of business insurance
in the U.S. and Canada, accepting such business mainly from
insurance brokers.

Transatlantic Holdings, Inc. (Transatlantic) subsidiaries offer
reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis both
in the U.S. and abroad. Transatlantic structures programs for a
full range of property and casualty products with an emphasis on
specialty risks.

AIG’s Personal Lines operations provide automobile
insurance through AIG Direct, the mass marketing operation of
AIG, Agency Auto Division and 21st Century Insurance Group (21st
Century), as well as a broad range of coverages for high
net-worth individuals through the AIG Private Client Group.

Mortgage Guaranty operations provide guaranty insurance
primarily on conventional first mortgage loans on single family
dwellings and condominiums.

AIG’s Foreign General Insurance group accepts risks
primarily underwritten through American International
Underwriters (AIU), a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned
agencies and insurance companies. The Foreign General Insurance
group also includes business written by AIG’s foreign-based
insurance subsidiaries. The Foreign General Insurance group uses
various marketing methods to write both business and consumer
lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws, customs
and needs. AIU operates in Asia, the Pacific Rim, the United
Kingdom, Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

Life Insurance & Retirement Services:

AIG’s
Life Insurance & Retirement Services subsidiaries offer
a wide range of insurance and retirement savings products both
domestically and abroad. Insurance-oriented products consist of
individual and group life, payout annuities, endowment and
accident and health policies. Retirement savings products
consist of fixed and variable annuities.

AIG’s principal overseas Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations are American Life Insurance
Company (ALICO), American International Assurance Company,
Limited, together with American International Assurance Company
(Bermuda) Limited (AIA), Nan Shan Life Insurance Company, Ltd.
(Nan Shan), The Philippine American Life and General Insurance
Company (PhilamLife), AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (AIG
Edison Life) and AIG Star Life Insurance Co. Ltd. (AIG Star
Life).

AIG’s principal domestic Life Insurance &
Retirement Services operations are American General Life
Insurance Company (AG Life), The United States Life
Insurance Company in the City of New York (USLIFE), American

Continued

General Life and Accident Insurance Company (AGLA), AIG Annuity
Insurance Company (AIG Annuity), The Variable Annuity Life
Insurance Company (VALIC) and AIG Retirement Services, Inc (AIG
SunAmerica).

AIRCO acts as an internal reinsurance company for AIG’s
foreign life operations.

Financial Services:

AIG’s Financial Services
subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and
services including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital
markets transactions, consumer finance and insurance premium
financing.

AIG’s Aircraft Finance operations represent the operations
of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new
and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign
airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of
commercial jets for its own account, for airlines and for
financial institutions.

AIG’s Capital Markets operations are conducted through
AIGFP. As Capital Markets is a transaction-oriented operation,
current and past revenues and operating results may not provide
a basis for predicting future performance. Also, AIG’s
Capital Markets operations may be adversely affected by the
downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings.

AIG’s Capital Markets operations derive substantially all
their revenues from hedged financial positions entered in
connection with counterparty transactions rather than from
speculative transactions. These subsidiaries participate in the
derivatives and financial transactions dealer markets
conducting, primarily as principal, an interest rate, currency,
equity, commodity, energy and credit products business.

Consumer Finance operations include AGF as well as AIGCFG. AGF
and AIGCFG provide a wide variety of consumer finance products,
including non-conforming real estate mortgages, consumer loans,
retail sales finance and credit-related insurance to customers
both domestically and overseas, particularly in emerging markets.

Asset Management:

AIG’s Asset Management operations
comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and
investment products including institutional and retail asset
management, broker dealer services and spread-based investment
business from the sale of guaranteed investment contracts, also
known as funding agreements (GICs). Such products and services
are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically
and overseas.

assets.

(a)

Including revenues from General Insurance operations in

    contracts, and realized capital gains (losses).

(c)

    operated by foreign airlines.

3. Federal Income Taxes

(a)

AIG and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a
consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. The AGC group of
life insurance companies also files a consolidated U.S. Federal
income tax return and will not be included in AIG’s
consolidated federal income tax return until 2007. Commencing
with taxable year 2004, the AIG SunAmerica group of life
insurance companies is included in AIG’s consolidated tax
return. Other U.S. entities included in the consolidated
financial statements also file separate U.S. Federal income tax
returns. Subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are taxed,
and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and
foreign statutes.

U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on
$750 million of undistributed earnings of certain
U.S. subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated
AIG U.S. Federal income tax return because tax planning
strategies are available, and would be utilized, to eliminate
the tax liability related to these earnings. U.S. federal
income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed
earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent
that such earnings have been reinvested abroad for an indefinite
period of time. At December 31, 2005, the cumulative amount
of undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries approximated
$13.8 billion.

A component of life insurance surplus accumulated prior to 1984
is not taxable unless it exceeds certain statutory limitations
or is distributed to shareholders. This surplus, accumulated in
policyholder surplus accounts, totaled approximately
$253 million at December 31, 2005. AIG has not made
any provision in the accompanying financial statements for
taxation of this amount as management has no intention of making
any taxable distributions from this surplus. During 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act amended federal income tax law to
permit life insurance companies to distribute amounts from
policyholders’ surplus accounts in 2005 and 2006 without
incurring federal income tax on the distributions. During 2005,
AIG reduced its policyholders’ surplus accounts to
$253 million and expects to eliminate its exposure to
federal income taxation on the remaining balance in 2006.

Revenue Agent’s Reports proposing to assess additional
taxes for the years

1991-1996

and

1997-1999

have been
issued to AIG. Apart from some relatively minor issues, years
prior to 1991 are closed. Letters of Protest contesting the
proposed assessments for

1991-1996

and

1997-1999

have been
filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In addition, Revenue Agent’s Reports proposing to assess
additional taxes for the years ended September 30,

1993-1994,

1995-1996,

and
September 30, 1997-December 31, 1998 have been issued
to AIG SunAmerica. Such proposed assessments relate to years
prior to AIG’s acquisition of SunAmerica, Inc. Letters of
Protest contesting the proposed assessments have been filed with
the IRS. SunAmerica Life Insurance Company (SunAmerica Life) has
also received a proposed assessment, and has filed a protest,
for the year ended December 31, 1999. It is
management’s belief that there are substantial arguments in
support of the positions taken by AIG, SunAmerica and SunAmerica
Life in their Letters of Protest. Although the final outcome of
any issues raised in connection with these examinations is
uncertain, AIG believes that any tax obliga-

tion, including interest thereon, would not be significant to
AIG’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity. American General Corporation’s (AGC) tax years
through 1999 have been audited and settled with the IRS.

(b) The pretax components of
domestic and foreign income reflect the locations in which such
pretax income was generated. The pretax domestic and foreign
income was as follows for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003:

(c) The U.S. Federal income tax
rate is 35 percent for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Actual tax
expense on income differs from the “expected” amount
computed by applying the Federal income tax rate because of the
following:

(a)

In 2005 and 2004, it was determined that the earnings of
    certain foreign subsidiaries are expected to be repatriated to
    the U.S., and, accordingly, the undistributed earnings of these
    subsidiaries are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested
    abroad. As a consequence of this determination, U.S. deferred
    taxes have been provided for the undistributed earnings of these
    foreign subsidiaries.

(b)

Foreign tax expense reflects the expense resulting from local
    tax regulation. Domestic tax expense includes U.S. taxes
    incurred on foreign income.

(d) The components of the net
deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
were as follows:

*

A valuation allowance in the amount of $280 million
    related to the Connecticut net deferred tax asset at
    December 31, 2005 (including net operating losses that
    expire between 2020 through 2025) has been provided because it
    is remote that such amount will be realized. In addition, AIG
    has a $192 million alternative minimum tax credit
    carryforward that does not expire.

4. Deferred Policy Acquisition
Costs

The following reflects the policy
acquisition costs deferred for amortization against future
income and the related amortization charged to income for
general and life insurance & retirement services
operations:

*

Relates to the acquisition of AIG Edison Life in August
    2003.

Included in the above table is the value of business acquired
(VOBA), an intangible asset recorded during purchase accounting,
which is amortized in a manner similar to deferred acquisition
costs. Amortization of VOBA was $291 million,
$407 million and $326 million while the unamortized
balance was $2.14 billion, $2.52 billion and
$3.17 billion for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
percentage of the unamortized balance of VOBA at 2005 expected
to be amortized for 2006 through 2011 by year is:
12.0 percent, 10.5 percent, 9.2 percent,
8.0 percent, and 6.7 percent, respectively, with
53.7 percent being amortized after five years. These
projections are based on current estimates for investment,
persistency, mortality, and morbidity assumptions. The DAC
amortization charged to income includes the increase or decrease
of amortization for FAS 97-related realized capital gains
(losses), primarily in the domestic Retirement Services
business. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the rate of
amortization expense has been decreased by $57 million,
$44 million and $54 million.

5. Reinsurance

In the ordinary course of business, AIG’s General and Life
Insurance companies place reinsurance with other insurance
companies in order to provide greater diversification of
AIG’s business and limit the potential for losses arising
from large risks.

General Reinsurance:

General reinsurance is effected
under reinsurance treaties and by negotiation on individual
risks. Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of
excess of loss contracts which protect AIG against losses over
stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid
reinsurance premiums and are amortized into income over the
contract period in proportion to the protection received.
Amounts recoverable from general reinsurers are estimated in a
manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with
the reinsurance and presented as a component of reinsurance
assets.

General Insurance premiums written and
earned were comprised of the following:

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
reinsurance recoveries, which reduced loss and loss expenses
incurred, amounted to $20.71 billion, $12.14 billion
and $10.09 billion, respectively.

Life Insurance:

AIG Life Insurance companies generally
limit exposure to loss on any single life. For ordinary
insurance, AIG generally retains a maximum of approximately $1.7
million of coverage per individual life with respect to
AIG’s overseas life operations and $10 million of
coverage per individual life with respect to AIG’s domestic
life operations. There are smaller retentions for other lines of
business. Life reinsurance is effected principally under yearly
renewable term treaties. The premiums with respect to these
treaties are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are
amortized into income over the

contract period in proportion to the protection provided.
Amounts recoverable from life reinsurers are estimated in a
manner consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying
policy benefits and are presented as a component of reinsurance
assets.

Life Insurance in force ceded to other
insurance companies was as follows:

Insurance & Retirement Services GAAP premiums assumed
represented 0.3 percent, 2.5 percent and
0.1 percent of gross GAAP premiums for the periods ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Supplemental information for gross loss
and benefit reserves net of ceded reinsurance at
December 31, 2005 and 2004 follows:

AIRCO acts primarily as an internal reinsurance company for
AIG’s foreign life operations. This facilitates insurance
risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and
capital planning locally (branch and subsidiary). It also allows
AIG to pool its insurance risks and purchase reinsurance more
efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty
risk and relationships and manage global life catastrophe risks.

AIG’s domestic Life Insurance & Retirement
Services operations utilize internal and third-party reinsurance
relationships to manage insurance risks and to facilitate
capital management strategies. Pools of highly-rated third-party
reinsurers are utilized to manage net amounts at risk in excess
of retention limits. AIG’s domestic life insurance
companies also cede excess, non-economic reserves carried on a
statutory-basis only on certain term and universal life
insurance policies and certain fixed annuities to an offshore
affiliate.

AIG generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain
statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance
transactions. For this purpose, AIG entered into a
$2.5 billion syndicated letter of credit facility in
December 2004. Letters of credit totaling $2.17 billion were
outstanding as of December 31, 2004, and letters of credit
for all $2.5 billion were outstanding as of
December 31, 2005, all of which relate to life intercompany
reinsurance transactions. The letter of credit facility has a
ten-year term, but the facility can be reduced or terminated by
the lenders beginning after seven years.

In November 2005, AIG entered into a revolving credit facility
for an aggregate amount of $3 billion. The facility can be
drawn in the form of letters of credit with terms of up to ten
years. As of December 31, 2005 and as of the date hereof,
$1.86 billion principal amount of letters of credit are
outstanding under this facility, of which approximately
$494 million relates to life intercompany reinsurance
transactions. AIG also obtained approximately $212 million
letters of credit on a bilateral basis.

Reinsurance Security:

AIG’s reinsurance arrangements
do not relieve AIG from its direct obligation to its insureds.
Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both general and
life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is
unable to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance
agreements. AIG holds substantial collateral as security under
related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities,
and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for
estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. AIG has been largely
successful in prior recovery efforts.

AIG evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and
establishes limits per reinsurer through AIG’s Credit Risk
Committee. AIG believes that no exposure to a single reinsurer
represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to AIG, nor is
AIG’s business substantially dependent upon any reinsurance
contract.

6. Reserve for Losses and Loss
Expenses and Future Life Policy Benefits and Policyholders’
Contract Deposits

(a) The following analysis
provides a reconciliation of the activity in the reserve for
losses and loss expenses:

(a)

Reflects the opening balances with respect to the GE
    U.S.-based auto and home insurance business acquired in 2003.

(b)

Includes accretion of discount of $(15) million in 2005,
    including an increase of $375 million in the discount
    recorded in 2005; $377 million in 2004 and
    $296 million in 2003.

(c)

Includes fourth quarter charge of $1.8 billion.

(d)

Includes fourth quarter charge of $850 million
    attributable to the change in estimate for asbestos and
    environmental exposures.

(b) The analysis of the future
policy benefits and policyholders’ contract deposits
liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004
follows:

(c)

Long duration contract liabilities included in future
policy benefits, as presented in the preceding table, result
from life products. Short duration contract liabilities are
primarily accident and health products. The liability for future
life policy benefits has been established based upon the
following assumptions:

(i) Interest rates (exclusive of immediate/terminal funding
annuities), which vary by territory, year of issuance and
products, range from 1.0 percent to 12.0 percent
within the first 20 years. Interest rates on
immediate/terminal funding annuities are at a maximum of
11.5 percent and grade to not greater than 6.0 percent.

(ii)

Mortality and surrender rates are based upon
actual experience by geographical area modified to allow for
variations in policy form. The weighted average lapse rate,
including surrenders, for individual and group life approximated
7.9 percent.

(iii) The portions of current and prior net income and of
current unrealized appreciation of investments that can inure to
the benefit of AIG are restricted in some cases by the insurance
contracts and by the local insurance regulations of the
countries in which the policies are in force.

(iv) Participating life business represented approximately
22 percent of the gross insurance in force at
December 31, 2005 and 36 percent of gross GAAP
premiums in 2005. The amount of annual dividends to be paid is
determined locally by the boards of directors. Provisions for
future dividend payments are computed by jurisdiction,
reflecting local regulations.

(d)

The liability for policyholders’ contract
deposits has been established based on the following assumptions:

(i) Interest rates credited on deferred annuities, which vary by
territory and year of issuance, range from 1.0 percent to,
including bonuses, 13.4 percent. Less than 1.0 percent
of the liabilities are credited at a rate greater than
9.0 percent. Current declared interest rates are generally
guaranteed to remain in effect for a period of one year though
some are guaranteed for longer periods. Withdrawal charges
generally range from zero percent to 14.0 percent grading
to zero over a period of zero to 19 years.

(ii) Domestically, GICs have market value withdrawal provisions
for any funds withdrawn other than benefit responsive payments.
Interest rates credited generally range from 1.4 percent to
9.0 percent. The vast majority of these GICs mature within
ten years. Overseas, interest rates credited on GICs
generally range from 1.2 percent to 5.6 percent and
maturities range from one to five years.

(iii) Interest rates on corporate life insurance products are
guaranteed at 4.0 percent and the weighted average rate
credited in 2005 was 5.4 percent.

(iv) The universal life funds have credited interest rates of
1.5 percent to 7.0 percent and guarantees ranging from
1.5 percent to 5.5 percent depending on the year of
issue. Additionally, universal life funds are subject to
surrender

Contract Deposits

charges that amount to 11.3 percent of the aggregate fund
balance grading to zero over a period not longer than
20 years.

(v) For variable products and investment contracts, policy
values are expressed in terms of investment units. Each unit is
linked to an asset portfolio. The value of a unit increases or
decreases based on the value of the linked asset portfolio. The
current liability at any time is the sum of the current unit
value of all investment units plus any liability for guaranteed
minimum death or withdrawal benefits. A portion of these
liabilities are classified in the GIC product line for segment
reporting purposes.

(e)

Certain products are subject to experience
adjustments. These include group life and group medical
products, credit life contracts, accident and health
insurance contracts/riders attached to life policies and, to a
limited extent, reinsurance agreements with other direct
insurers. Ultimate premiums from these contracts are estimated
and recognized as revenue, and the unearned portions of the
premiums are held as reserves. Experience adjustments vary
according to the type of contract and the territory in which the
policy is in force and are subject to local regulatory guidance.

AIG’s insurance subsidiaries file financial statements
prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices
prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance
regulatory authorities. The differences between statutory
financial statements and financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign
by jurisdiction. The principal differences are that statutory
financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition
costs, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost,
assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance,
policyholder liabilities are valued using more conservative
assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.

AIG also recently completed its 2005 unaudited statutory
financial statements for all of its Domestic General Insurance
subsidiaries, after reviewing and agreeing with the relevant
state insurance regulators the statutory accounting treatment of
various items. The state regulators have permitted the Domestic
General Insurance companies to record a $724 million
reduction to opening statutory surplus as of January 1,
2005 to reflect the effects of the Second Restatement.

Statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum
company action level requirements following the adjustments, but
AIG nonetheless contributed an additional $750 million of
capital into American Home Assurance Company (American Home)
effective September 30, 2005 and contributed a further
$2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of
approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General
Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005.

(e) Fixed Maturities Below Investment Grade:

At
December 31, 2005, fixed maturities held by AIG that were
below investment grade or not rated totaled $20.54 billion.

(f) Non-Income Producing Invested Assets:

At
December 31, 2005, non-income producing invested assets
were insignificant.

(g) Gross Unrealized Losses and Estimated Fair Values on
Investments:

The following table summarizes the
gross unrealized losses and cost basis on insurance and asset
management investment securities, aggregated by major investment
category and length of time that individual securities have been
in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004.

(a)

For bonds, represents amortized cost.

(b)

Primarily relates to the “All other corporate”
    category.

As of December 31, 2005, AIG held 18,308 and 1,503 of
individual bond and stock investments that were in an unrealized
loss position, of which 3,074 individual investments were in an
unrealized loss position continuously for 12 months or more.

AIG recorded impairment losses net of taxes of approximately
$389 million, $369 million and $1.0 billion in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 1(c) herein for
AIG’s other-than-temporary impairment accounting policy.

The carrying value, which approximates market value, of other
invested assets as of December 31, 2005 was
$27.3 billion, consisting primarily of hedge funds and
limited partnerships. Of the $27.3 billion, approximately
$5.1 billion relates to investments accounted for on an
available for sale basis, with almost all of the remaining
investments being accounted for on the equity method of
accounting. All of the investments are subject to impairment
testing (refer to Note 1(c) herein). Of the investments
accounted for as available for sale, the gross unrealized loss
as of December 31, 2005 was $440 million, the majority
of which represents investments that have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.

(h) Hedging of Securities Available for Sale:

AIGFP
follows a policy of minimizing interest rate, currency,
commodity, and equity risks associated with securities available
for sale by entering into internal offsetting positions, on a
security by security basis within its derivatives portfolio,
thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized
appreciation and depreciation. In addition, to reduce its credit
risk, AIGFP has entered into credit derivative transactions with
respect to $125 million of securities available for sale to
economically hedge its credit risk. As previously discussed
these economic offsets do not meet the hedge accounting
requirements of FAS 133 and, as such, are recorded in other
revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

(b) Borrowings under Obligations of Guaranteed
Investment Agreements:

Borrowings under obligations of
guaranteed investment agreements, which are guaranteed by AIG,
are recorded at the amount outstanding under each contract.
Obligations may be called at various times prior to maturity at
the option of the counterparty. Interest rates on these
borrowings are primarily fixed, vary by maturity, and range up
to 9.8 percent.

Funds received from GIA borrowings are invested in a diversified
portfolio of securities and derivative transactions. At
December 31, 2005, the market value of securities pledged
as collateral with respect to these obligations approximated
$7.0 billion.

(c) Medium Term Notes Payable:

(i) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued by AGF: AGF’s
Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which generally may
not be redeemed by AGF prior to maturity and bear interest at
either fixed rates set by AGF at issuance or variable rates
determined by reference to an interest rate or other formula.

As of December 31, 2005, notes aggregating
$17.74 billion were outstanding with maturity dates ranging
from 2006 to 2015 at interest rates ranging from
1.65 percent to 7.50 percent. To the extent deemed
appropriate, AGF may enter into swap transactions to manage its
effective borrowing rates with respect to these notes.

(ii) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued by ILFC: ILFC’s
Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which generally may
not be redeemed by ILFC prior to maturity and bear interest at
either fixed rates set by ILFC at issuance or variable rates
determined by an interest rate or other formula.

As of December 31, 2005, notes aggregating
$4.69 billion were outstanding with maturity dates from
2006 to 2013 at interest rates ranging from 2.25 percent to
6.98 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, ILFC may
enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing
rates with respect to these notes.

(iii) Medium Term Notes Payable Issued by AIG: AIG’s
Medium Term Notes are unsecured obligations which generally may
not be redeemed by AIG prior to maturity and bear interest at
either fixed rates set by AIG at issuance or variable rates
determined by reference to an interest rate or other formula.

The interest rate on AIG’s Medium Term Note is
0.5 percent. To the extent deemed appropriate, AIG may
enter into swap transactions to manage its effective borrowing
rate with respect to this note.

At December 31, 2005, Medium Term Notes originally issued
by SunAmerica, Inc. (SAI), which was merged into AIG on
January 1, 1999, aggregating $47 million had maturity
dates ranging from 2006 to 2026 at interest rates ranging from
6.43 percent to 7.05 percent.

During 2000, AIG issued $210 million of equity-linked
Medium Term Notes due May 15, 2007. These notes accrue
interest at the rate of 0.50 percent and the total return
on these notes is linked to the appreciation in market value of
AIG’s common stock. The notes may be redeemed, at the
option of AIG, as a whole but not in part, at any time on or
after May 15, 2003. In conjunction with the issuance of
these notes, AIG entered into a series of swap transactions
which effectively converted its interest expense to a fixed rate
of 7.17 percent until May 15, 2003 and a floating rate
of LIBOR minus 0.50 percent thereafter and transferred the
equity appreciation exposure to a third party for the life of
the notes. AIG is exposed to credit risk with respect to the
counterparties to these swap transactions. During 2003 and 2004,
$45 million and $100 million of these notes were
redeemed, respectively.

(d) Notes and Bonds Payable:

(i) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AIGFP:

At December 31, 2005, AIGFP’s
notes and bonds outstanding, the proceeds of which are invested
in a diversified portfolio of securities and derivative
transactions, were as follows:

AIGFP economically hedges its notes and bonds. AIG guarantees
all of AIGFP’s debt.

(ii) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by ILFC: As of
December 31, 2005, notes aggregating $15.01 billion
were outstanding with maturity dates from 2006 to 2065 and
interest rates ranging from 2.95 percent to
6.63 percent. Notes aggregating $3.52 billion are at
floating interest rates and the remainder are at fixed rates.

The foreign exchange adjustment for the foreign currency
denominated debt was $197 million at December 31, 2005
and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2004. ILFC had
$13.13 billion of debt securities registered for public
sale at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005,
$8.66 billion of debt securities were issued. In addition,
ILFC has a Euro Medium Term Note Program for $7.0 billion,
under which $4.98 billion in notes were sold through
December 31, 2005. ILFC has substantially eliminated the
currency exposure arising from foreign currency denominated
notes by economically hedging that portion of the note exposure
not already offset by Euro denominated operating lease payments,
although such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under FAS 133. Notes issued under this program
are included in Notes and Bonds Payable.

ILFC had a $4.3 billion Export Credit Facility (ECA) for
use in connection with the purchase of approximately 75 aircraft
delivered through 2001. This facility was guaranteed by various
European Export Credit Agencies. The interest rate varies from
5.75 percent to 5.90 percent on these amortizing
ten-year borrowings depending on the delivery date of the
aircraft. At December 31, 2005, ILFC had $1.2 billion
outstanding under this facility. The debt is collateralized by a
pledge of the shares of a subsidiary of ILFC, which holds title
to the aircraft financed under the facility.

In May 2004, ILFC entered into a similarly structured ECA for up
to a maximum of $2.64 billion for Airbus aircraft to be
delivered through May 31, 2005. The facility has since been
extended to include aircraft to be delivered through
May 31, 2006. The facility becomes available as the various
European Export Credit Agencies provide their guarantees for
aircraft based on a six-month forward-looking calendar, and the
interest rate is determined through a bid process. At
December 31, 2005, ILFC had $1.4 billion outstanding
under this facility. Borrowings with respect to these facilities
are included in Notes and Bonds Payable.

In August 2004, ILFC received a commitment for an Ex-Im Bank
comprehensive guarantee in the amount of $1.68 billion to
support the financing of up to 30 new Boeing aircraft. The
initial delivery period from September 1, 2004 through
August 31, 2005 has been extended by ILFC to
August 31, 2006. ILFC did not have any borrowings
outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2005. From
time to time, ILFC enters into various bank financings. As of
December 31, 2005 the total funded amount was
$1.4 billion. The financings mature through 2010. One
tranche of one of the loans totaling $410 million was
funded in Japanese yen and swapped to U.S. dollars.

In December of 2005, ILFC entered into two tranches of junior
subordinated debt totaling $1.0 billion. Both mature on
December 21, 2065, but each tranche has a different call
option. The $600 million tranche has a call date of
December 21, 2010 and the $400 million tranche has a
call date of December 21, 2015. The note with the 2010 call
date has a fixed interest rate of 5.90 percent for the first
five years. The note with the 2015 call date has a fixed
interest rate of 6.25 percent for the first ten years. Both
tranches have interest rate adjustments if the call option is
not exercised. The new interest rate is a floating quarterly
reset rate based on the initial credit spread plus the highest
of (i) 3 month LIBOR, (ii) 10-year constant
maturity treasury and (iii) 30-year constant maturity
treasury.

AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of ILFC.

(iii) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AGF: As of
December 31, 2005, AGF notes aggregating $983 million
were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2006 to 2010
at interest rates ranging from 4.03 percent to
8.45 percent.

In 2005, AGF increased its shelf registration statement by
$10.0 billion. AGF had $11.1 billion of debt
securities registered and available for issuance at
December 31, 2005. AGF uses the proceeds from the issuance
of notes and bonds for the funding of its finance receivables.

AIG does not guarantee any of the debt obligations of AGF.

(iv) Notes, Bonds and Debentures Issued by AIG:

(A) Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Debentures: On
November 9, 2001, AIG issued zero coupon convertible senior
debentures in the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity
of $1.52 billion. The notes were offered at
65.8 percent of principal amount at stated maturity, bear
no interest unless contingent interest becomes payable under
certain conditions and are due November 9, 2031. The net
proceeds to AIG were $990 million. Commencing
January 1, 2002, holders may

convert the debentures into shares of AIG common stock at a
conversion rate of 6.0627 shares per $1,000 principal
amount of debentures on any day if AIG’s common stock price
exceeds 120 percent of the conversion price on the last
trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter for a set period of
time, and after September 30, 2031, on any day if
AIG’s common stock price exceeds such amount for one day,
subject to certain restrictions. The debentures are redeemable
by AIG on or after November 9, 2006 at specified redemption
prices. Holders may require AIG to repurchase the debentures at
specified repurchase prices on November 9, 2006, 2011,
2016, 2021, and 2026. At December 31, 2005, the debentures
outstanding had a face value of $1.52 billion, unamortized
discount of $460 million and a net book value of
$1.06 billion. The amortization of the original issue
discount was recorded as a component of other operating expenses.

(B) Notes and Debentures Issued by SAI: As of
December 31, 2005, notes and debentures originally issued
by SAI aggregating $435 million (net of unamortized
discount of $40 million) were outstanding with maturity
dates from 2007 to 2097 at interest rates ranging from
5.60 percent to 9.95 percent.

(C) Term Notes: On September 30, 2005, AIG sold
$1.5 billion principal amount of notes in a Rule 144A/
Regulation S offering, $500 million of which bear
interest at a rate of 4.700 percent per annum and mature in
2010 and $1.0 billion of which bear interest at a rate of
5.050 percent per annum and mature in 2015. The notes are
senior unsecured obligations of AIG and rank equally with all of
AIG’s other senior debt outstanding. AIG has agreed to use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate an exchange offer
for the notes pursuant to an effective registration statement
within 360 days of the date on which the notes were issued.

On May 15, 2003, AIG sold $1.5 billion principal
amount of notes in a Rule 144A/Regulation S offering,
$500 million of which bear interest at a rate of 2.875
percent per annum and mature in 2008 and $1.0 billion of
which bear interest at a rate of 4.250 percent per annum and
mature in 2013. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of
AIG and rank equally with all of AIG’s other senior debt
outstanding. AIG completed an exchange offer in April 2004 with
respect to the Rule 144A/Regulation S Notes and issued
in exchange substantially identical notes that are registered
under the Securities Act.

(v) Notes and Bonds Payable Issued by AGC: As of
December 31, 2005, AGC notes aggregating $797 million
were outstanding with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2029
at interest rates ranging up to 7.75 percent.

(f) Liabilities Connected to Trust Preferred Stock:

AGC issued Junior Subordinated Debentures (liabilities) to four
trusts established by AGC, which represent the sole assets of
the trusts. The trusts have no independent operations. The
trusts issued mandatory redeemable preferred stock to investors.
The interest terms and payment dates of the liabilities
correspond to those of the preferred stock. AGC’s
obligations with respect to the liabilities and related
agreements, when taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by AGC of payments due on the preferred
securities. The liabilities are redeemable, under certain
conditions, at the option of AGC on a proportionate basis.

The preferred stock consists of $300 million liquidation value
of 8.5 percent preferred stock issued by American General
Capital II in June 2000, $500 million liquidation value of
8.125 percent preferred stock issued by American General
Institutional Capital B in March 1997, and $500 million
liquidation value of 7.57 percent preferred stock issued by
American General Institutional Capital A in December 1996.

In December 2005, $100 million liquidation value of 8.05
percent preferred stock were redeemed by American General
Capital III.

(g) Revolving Credit Facilities:

AIG and AIG
Funding, Inc. (AIG Funding) are parties to unsecured
syndicated revolving credit facilities aggregating
$2.75 billion, consisting of $1.375 billion in a

364-day

revolving
credit facility that expires in July of 2006 and
$1.375 billion in a five-year revolving credit facility
that expires in July of 2010. The

364-day

facility allows
for the conversion by AIG of any outstanding loans at expiration
into

one-year

term
loans. The facilities can be used for general corporate purposes
and also to provide backup for AIG’s commercial paper
programs administered by AIG Funding. AIG expects to replace or
extend these credit facilities on or prior to their expiration.
There are currently no borrowings outstanding under these
facilities, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of December
31, 2005.

In November 2005, AIG and AIG Funding entered into a 364-day
revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount of
$3 billion, which can be drawn in the form of loans or
letters of credit. The credit facility expires in November 2006
but allows for the issuance of letters of credit with terms of
up to ten years and provides for the conversion by AIG of any
outstanding loans at expiration into one-year term loans. The
facility can be used for general corporate purposes, including

such dates, $1.14 billion was available to be drawn under
the facility, with the remainder having been drawn in the form
of letters of credit.

AIG is also a party to an unsecured inter-company revolving
credit facility provided by certain of its subsidiaries
aggregating $2 billion that expires in October of 2006. The
facility allows for the conversion of any outstanding loans at
expiration into one-year term loans. The facility can be used
for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup for
AIG’s commercial paper programs. AIG expects to replace or
extend this credit facility on or prior to its expiration. There
are currently no borrowings outstanding under the inter-company
facility, nor were any borrowings outstanding as of
December 31, 2005.

AGF is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit
facilities aggregating $4.25 billion, consisting of
$2.125 billion in a

364-day

revolving
credit facility that expires in July 2006 and
$2.125 billion in a five-year credit facility that expires

ILFC is a party to unsecured syndicated revolving credit
facilities aggregating $6.0 billion. The facilities can be
used for general corporate purposes and also to provide backup
for ILFC’s commercial paper program. They consist of
$2.0 billion in a

364-day

revolving
credit facility that expires in October 2006, with a one-year
term out option, $2.0 billion in a five-year revolving
credit facility that expires in October 2009 and
$2.0 billion in a five-year revolving credit facility that
expires in October 2010. ILFC expects to replace or extend these
credit facilities on or prior to their expiration. There are
currently no borrowings outstanding under these facilities, nor
were any borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

ILFC was a party to two 180-day revolving credit facilities
aggregating to $1.0 billion, each of which expired in 2005.

(h) Interest Expense for All Indebtedness:

Total
interest expense for all indebtedness, net of capitalized
interest, aggregated $5.67 billion in 2005,
$4.43 billion in 2004 and $4.22 billion in 2003.
Capitalized interest was $64 million in 2005,
$59 million in 2004 and $52 million in 2003. Cash
distributions on the preferred shareholders’ equity in
subsidiary companies of ILFC and liabilities connected to trust
preferred stock of AGC subsidiaries are accounted for as
interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. The
cash distributions for ILFC were approximately $5 million,
$4 million, and $4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The cash
distributions for AGC subsidiaries were approximately
$112 million, $123 million and $128 million for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

10. Preferred Shareholders’
Equity in Subsidiary Companies

As of December 31, 2005, preferred shareholders’
equity in subsidiary companies represents preferred stocks
issued by ILFC, a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG.

At December 31, 2005, the preferred stock consists of 1,000
shares of market auction preferred stock (MAPS) in two series
(Series A and B) of 500 shares each. Each of the MAPS
shares has a liquidation value of $100,000 per share and is
not convertible. The dividend rate, other than the initial rate,
for each dividend period for each series is reset approximately
every seven weeks (49 days) on the basis of orders placed
in an auction. During 2001, ILFC extended the term of the
Series A to five years at a dividend rate of
5.90 percent. At December 31, 2005, the dividend rate
for Series B was 4.51 percent.

Shareholders’ Equity

(a)

AIG parent depends on its subsidiaries for cash flow
in the form of loans, advances, reimbursement for shared
expenses, and dividends. AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are
subject to regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends
which can be remitted to AIG parent. These restrictions vary by
state. For example, unless permitted by the New York
Superintendent of Insurance, general insurance companies
domiciled in New York may not pay dividends to shareholders
which in any twelve month period exceed the lesser of
ten percent of the company’s statutory
policyholders’ surplus or 100 percent of its
“adjusted net investment income,” as defined.
Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to both General
and Life Insurance companies exist in most of the other states
in which AIG’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled.
Certain foreign jurisdictions have restrictions which could
delay or limit the remittance of dividends. There are also
various local restrictions limiting cash loans and advances to
AIG by its subsidiaries. Largely as a result of the
restrictions, approximately 89 percent of consolidated
shareholders’ equity was restricted from immediate transfer
to AIG parent at December 31, 2005.

(b)

At December 31, 2005, there were 6,000,000
shares of AIG’s $5 par value serial preferred stock
authorized, issuable in series, none of which were outstanding.

Commitments and Contingent
    Liabilities

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are entered into by AIG and certain of
its subsidiaries. In addition, AIG guarantees various
obligations of certain subsidiaries.

(a)

AIG and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to
derivative financial instruments with market risk resulting from
both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency,
interest rate, equity, and commodity exposures. These
instruments are carried at their estimated fair values in the
consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of AIG’s
derivative activity is transacted by AIGFP. See also
Note 20 herein.

(b)

Securities sold, but not yet purchased and spot
commodities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of
AIGFP to deliver specified securities and spot commodities at
their contracted prices. AIGFP records a liability to repurchase
the securities and spot commodities in the market at prevailing
prices.

AIG has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the
prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment
obligations and liabilities of AIGFP arising from transactions
entered into by AIGFP. Net revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 from Capital Markets
operations were $3.26 billion, $1.28 billion and
$595 million, respectively.

(c)

At December 31, 2005, ILFC had committed to
purchase 338 new and used aircraft deliverable from 2006
through 2015 at an estimated aggregate price of
$23.3 billion and had options to purchase 16 new aircraft
at an estimated aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion.
ILFC will be required to find customers for any aircraft
acquired, and it anticipates that it will be required to arrange
financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment.

(d)

AIG and its subsidiaries, in common with the
insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation,
including claims for punitive damages, in the normal course of
their business. The recent trend of increasing jury awards and
settlements makes it difficult to assess the ultimate outcome of
such litigation.

Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of the established
reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can be no assurance
that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not develop
adversely and materially exceed AIG’s current loss
reserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and
loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines
of business, which include excess and umbrella liability,
directors and officers liability (D&O), professional
liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general
liability, products liability and related classes, as well as
for asbestos and environmental exposures. Generally, actual
historical loss development factors are used to project future
loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future
loss development patterns will be the same as in the past.
Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss
development factors might not be discernible for an extended
period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss
reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the
potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be
significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss
development factors that were relied upon in setting the
reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss development
factors could be attributable to changes in inflation in labor
and material costs or in the judicial environment, or in other
social or economic phenomena affecting claims.

(e)

SAI Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, has established a deferred
compensation plan for registered representatives of certain AIG
subsidiaries, pursuant to which participants have the
opportunity to invest deferred commissions and fees on a
notional basis. The value of the deferred compensation
fluctuates with the value of the deferred investment
alternatives chosen. AIG has provided a full and unconditional
guarantee of the obligations of SAI Deferred Compensation
Holdings, Inc. to pay the deferred compensation under the plan.

(f)

On June 27, 2005, AIG entered into agreements
pursuant to which AIG agrees, subject to certain conditions, to
(i) make any payment that is not promptly paid with respect
to the benefits accrued by certain employees of AIG and its
subsidiaries under the SICO Plans (as defined in Note 16)
and (ii) make any payment to the extent not promptly paid
by Starr with respect to amounts that become payable to certain
employees of AIG and its subsidiaries who are also stockholders
of Starr after the giving of a notice of repurchase or
redemption under Starr’s organizational documents. In
January 2006, Starr announced that it had completed its tender
offer to

purchase interests in Starr and that all eligible shares had
tendered their shares. As a result of completion of the tender
offer, no executive currently holds any Starr interests.

(g)

AIG and certain of its subsidiaries have been named
defendants in two putative class actions in state court in
Alabama that arise out of the 1999 settlement of class and
derivative litigation involving Caremark Rx, Inc. (Caremark). An
excess policy issued by a subsidiary of AIG with respect to the
1999 litigation was expressly stated to be without limit of
liability. In the current actions, plaintiffs allege that the
judge approving the 1999 settlement was misled as to the extent
of available insurance coverage and would not have approved the
settlement had he known of the existence and/or unlimited nature
of the excess policy. They further allege that AIG, its
subsidiaries, and Caremark are liable for fraud and suppression
for misrepresenting and/or concealing the nature and extent of
coverage. In their complaint, plaintiffs request compensatory
damages for the 1999 class in the amount of $3.2 billion,
plus punitive damages. AIG and its subsidiaries deny the
allegations of fraud and suppression and have asserted,

inter
alia

, that information concerning the excess policy was
publicly disclosed months prior to the approval of the
settlement. AIG and its subsidiaries further assert that the
current claims are barred by the statute of limitations and that
plaintiffs’ assertions that the statute was tolled cannot
stand against the public disclosure of the excess coverage.
Plaintiffs, in turn, have asserted that the disclosure was
insufficient to inform them of the nature of the coverage and
did not start the running of the statute of limitations. On
January 28, 2005, the Alabama trial court determined that
one of the current actions may proceed as a class action on
behalf of the 1999 classes that were allegedly defrauded by the
settlement. AIG, its subsidiaries, and Caremark are seeking
appellate relief from the Alabama Supreme Court. AIG cannot now
estimate either the likelihood of its prevailing in these
actions or the potential damages in the event liability is
determined.

(h)

On December 30, 2004, an arbitration panel
issued its ruling in connection with a 1998 workers compensation
quota share reinsurance agreement under which Superior National
Insurance Company, among others, was reinsured by USLIFE, a
subsidiary of American General Corporation. In its

2-1

ruling the
arbitration panel refused to rescind the contract as requested
by USLIFE. Instead, the panel reformed the contract to reduce
USLIFE’s participation by ten percent. USLIFE
disagrees with the ruling and is pursuing all appropriate legal
remedies. USLIFE has certain reinsurance recoverables in
connection with the contract and the arbitration ruling
established a second phase of arbitration in which USLIFE will
present its challenges to cessions to the contract.

AIG recorded a $178 million pre-tax charge in the fourth
quarter of 2004 related to this matter and holds a reserve of
approximately $364 million as of December 31, 2005.

(i)

Regulators from several states have commenced
investigations into insurance brokerage practices related to
contingent commissions and other broker-related conduct, such as
alleged bid rigging. Various parties, including insureds and
shareholders, have also asserted putative class action and other
claims against AIG or its subsidiaries alleging, among other
things, violations of the antitrust and federal securities laws,
and AIG expects that additional claims may be made.

In February 2006, AIG reached a resolution of claims and matters
under investigation with the United States Department of Justice
(DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Office
of the New York Attorney General (NYAG) and the New York State
Department of Insurance (DOI). The settlements resolved
outstanding litigation filed by the SEC, NYAG and DOI against
AIG and concluded negotiations with these authorities and the
DOJ in connection with the accounting, financial reporting and
insurance brokerage practices of AIG and its subsidiaries, as
well as claims relating to the underpayment of certain workers
compensation premium taxes and other assessments. The 2005
financial statements include a fourth quarter after-tax charge
of $1.15 billion to record the settlements.

As a result of these settlements, AIG made payments totaling
approximately $1.64 billion, $225 million of which
represented fines and penalties. A substantial portion of the
money will be available to resolve claims asserted in various
regulatory and civil proceedings, including shareholder lawsuits.

Also, as part of the settlements, AIG has agreed to retain for a
period of three years an independent consultant who will conduct
a review that will include the adequacy of AIG’s internal
control over financial reporting and the remediation plan that
AIG has implemented as a result of its own internal review.

Various federal and state regulatory agencies are reviewing
certain other transactions and practices of AIG and its
subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other
inquiries. AIG has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate,
in producing documents and other information in response to the
subpoenas.

A number of lawsuits have been filed regarding the subject
matter of the investigations of insurance brokerage practices,
including derivative actions, individual actions and class
actions under the federal securities laws, Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (ERISA) and state common and corporate laws in both
federal and state courts, including the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District
of New York), in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior
Court and in Delaware Chancery Court. All of these actions
generally allege that AIG and its subsidiaries violated the law
by allegedly concealing a scheme to “rig bids” and
“steer” business between insurance companies and
insurance brokers.

Since October 19, 2004, AIG or its subsidiaries have been
named as a defendant in fifteen complaints that were filed in
federal court and two that were originally filed in state court
(Massachusetts and Florida) and removed to federal court. These
cases generally allege that AIG and its subsidiaries

Liabilities

Continued

violated federal and various state antitrust laws, as well as
federal RICO laws, various state deceptive and unfair practice
laws and certain state laws governing fiduciary duties. The
alleged basis of these claims is that there was a conspiracy
between insurance companies and insurance brokers with regard to
the use of contingent commission agreements, bidding practices,
and other broker-related conduct concerning coverage in certain
sectors of the insurance industry. The Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation entered an order on February 17,
2005, consolidating most of these cases and transferring them to
the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
(District of New Jersey). The remainder of these cases have been
transferred to the District of New Jersey. On August 15,
2005, the plaintiffs in the multidistrict litigation filed a
Corrected First Consolidated Amended Commercial Class Action
Complaint, which, in addition to the previously named AIG
defendants, names new AIG subsidiaries as defendants. Also on
August 15, 2005, AIG and two subsidiaries were named as
defendants in a Corrected First Consolidated Amended Employee
Benefits Class Action Complaint filed in the District of New
Jersey, which asserts similar claims with respect to employee
benefits insurance and a claim under ERISA on behalf of putative
classes of employers and employees. On November 29, 2005,
the AIG defendants, along with other insurer defendants and the
broker defendants filed motions to dismiss both the Commercial
and Employee Benefits Complaints. Plaintiffs have filed a motion
for class certification in the consolidated action. In addition,
complaints were filed against AIG and several of its
subsidiaries in Massachusetts and Florida state courts, which
have both been stayed. In the Florida action, the plaintiff has
filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the District
Court of Appeals of the State of Florida, Fourth District with
respect to the stay order. On February 9, 2006, a complaint
against AIG and several of its subsidiaries was filed in Texas
state court, making claims similar to those in the federal cases
above.

In April and May 2005, amended complaints were filed in the
consolidated derivative and securities cases, as well as in one
of the ERISA lawsuits, pending in the Southern District of New
York adding allegations concerning AIG’s accounting
treatment for non-traditional insurance products. In September
2005, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated
securities cases adding allegations concerning AIG’s First
Restatement. Also in September 2005, a new securities action
complaint was filed in the Southern District of New York,
asserting claims premised on the same allegations made in the
consolidated cases. Motions to dismiss have been filed in the
securities actions. In September 2005, a consolidated complaint
was filed in the ERISA case pending in the Southern District of
New York. Motions to dismiss have been filed in that ERISA case.
Also in April 2005, new derivative actions were filed in
Delaware Chancery Court, and in July and August 2005, two new
derivative actions were filed in the Southern District of New
York asserting claims duplicative of the claims made in the
consolidated derivative action.

In July 2005, a second amended complaint was filed in the
consolidated derivative case in the Southern District of New
York, expanding upon accounting-related allegations, based upon
the First Restatement and, in August 2005, an amended
consolidated complaint was filed. In June 2005, the derivative
cases in Delaware were consolidated. AIG’s Board of
Directors has appointed a special committee of independent
directors to review the matters asserted in the derivative
complaints. The courts have approved agreements staying the
derivative cases pending in the Southern District of New York
and in Delaware Chancery Court while the special committee of
independent directors performs its work. In September 2005, a
shareholder filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking
documents relating to some of the allegations made in the
derivative suits. AIG filed a motion to dismiss in October 2005.

In late 2002, a derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery
Court in connection with AIG’s transactions with certain
entities affiliated with Starr and Starr International Company,
Inc. (SICO). In May 2005, the plaintiff filed an amended
complaint which adds additional claims premised on allegations
relating to insurance brokerage practices and AIG’s
non-traditional insurance products. Plaintiffs in that case have
agreed to dismiss newly added allegations unrelated to
transactions with entities affiliated with Starr and SICO
without prejudice to pursuit of these claims in the separate
derivative actions described above. On February 16, 2006,
the Delaware Chancery Court entered an order dismissing the
litigation with prejudice with respect to AIG’s outside
directors and dismissing the claims against the remaining AIG
defendants without prejudice.

AIG cannot predict the outcome of the matters described above or
estimate the potential costs related to these matters and,
accordingly, no reserve is being established in AIG’s
financial statements at this time. In the opinion of AIG
management, AIG’s ultimate liability for the unresolved
matters referred to above is not likely to have a material
adverse effect on AIG’s consolidated financial condition,
although it is possible that the effect would be material to
AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual
reporting period.

(j)

On July 8, 2005, SICO filed a complaint against
AIG in the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges
that AIG is in the possession of items, including artwork, which
SICO claims it owns, and seeks an order causing AIG to release
those items as well as actual, consequential, punitive and
exemplary damages. On September 27, 2005, AIG filed its
answer to SICO’s complaint denying SICO’s allegations
and asserting counter-claims for breach of contract, unjust
enrichment, conversion and breach of fiduciary duty relating to
SICO’s breach of its commitment to use its AIG shares for
the benefit of AIG and its employees. On October 17, 2005,
SICO replied to AIG’s counter-claims and additionally
sought a judgment declaring that SICO is neither a control
person nor an affiliate of AIG for purposes of Schedule 13D
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act), and Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933, as

amended (the Securities Act), respectively. AIG responded to the
SICO claims on November 7, 2005.

(k)

AIG subsidiaries own interests in certain limited
liability companies (LLCs) which invested in six coal synthetic
fuel production facilities. The sale of coal synthetic fuel
produced by these six facilities generates income tax credits.
Since acquiring the facilities, AIG has recognized approximately
$1.0 billion of synfuel tax credits through
December 31, 2005. One of the conditions a taxpayer must
meet to qualify for coal synfuel tax credits is that the synfuel
production facility must have been “placed in service”
before July 1, 1998. On July 1, 2005 IRS field agents
issued notices of proposed adjustment to the LLCs proposing to
disallow all of the credits taken by the LLCs during the years
2001 through 2003. The IRS field agents subsequently conceded
that one of the facilities was timely placed in service, but
contended that none of the other underlying production
facilities were placed in service by the statutory deadline. On
October 3, 2005, IRS field agents issued

60-day

letters to the
LLCs proposing to disallow the tax credits taken with respect to
synfuel sales by the remaining five production facilities. By
letters dated February 17, 2006, the IRS field agents have
advised the LLCs that they have, after further review, concluded
that all six production facilities were placed in service before
July 1, 1998 and that they will withdraw the

60-day

letters issued
to the LLCs.

Tax credits generated from the production and sale of synthetic
fuel under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code are
subject to an annual phase-out provision that is based on the
average wellhead price of domestic crude oil. The price range
within which the tax credits are phased-out was originally
established in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation.
Depending on the price of domestic crude oil for a particular
year, all or a portion of the tax credits generated in that year
might be eliminated. Although AIG cannot predict the future
price of domestic crude oil for the years 2006 and 2007 (the
final year the tax credits are available), AIG does not expect
the phase-out provision to affect tax credits generated in 2005.
AIG has also entered into hedges designed to mitigate a portion
of its future exposure to a sustained high price of oil.
However, no assurance can be given as to the effectiveness of
the hedging in actually reducing such exposure or whether such
hedging will continue.

(l)

AIG understands that some of its employees have
received Wells notices in connection with previously disclosed
SEC investigations of certain of AIG’s transactions or
accounting practices. Under SEC procedures, a Wells notice is an
indication that the SEC staff has made a preliminary decision to
recommend enforcement action that provides recipients with an
opportunity to respond to the SEC staff before a formal
recommendation is finalized. AIG anticipates that additional
current and former employees could receive similar notices in
the future as the regulatory investigations proceed.

(m)

In August 2005, the Bureau of Labor Insurance in
Taiwan began to levy a monthly administrative penalty against
Nan Shan for not providing its agency leaders a choice between
alternative government pension plans. Nan Shan has reached an
agreement with the agency union and the ultimate liability is
not material to AIG’s consolidated financial condition or
results of operations.

13.

Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments” (FAS 107), requires disclosure of fair
value information about financial instruments, as defined
therein, for which it is practicable to estimate such fair
value. In the measurement of the fair value of certain financial
instruments, where quoted market prices are not available, other
valuation techniques are utilized. These fair value estimates
are derived using internally developed valuation methodologies
based on available and observable market information.
FAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments, including
those related to insurance contracts.

The following methods and assumptions were used by AIG in
estimating the fair value of the financial instruments presented:

Cash and short-term investments:

The carrying amounts
approximate fair values.

Fixed maturity securities:

Fair values were generally
based upon quoted market prices. For certain fixed maturity
securities for which market prices were not readily available,
fair values were estimated using values obtained from
independent pricing services.

Equity securities:

Fair values were based upon quoted
market prices.

Mortgage loans on real estate, policy and collateral
loans:

Where practical, the fair values of loans on real
estate and collateral loans were estimated using discounted cash
flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental
lending rates for similar type loans. The fair values of the
policy loans were not calculated as AIG believes it would have
to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Trading assets and trading liabilities:

Fair values
approximate the carrying values.

Finance receivables:

Fair values were estimated using
discounted cash flow calculations based upon the weighted
average rates currently being offered for similar finance
receivables.

Securities available for sale:

Fair values were based on
quoted market prices. Where market prices were not readily
available, fair values were estimated using quoted market prices
of comparable investments.

Securities lending collateral and securities lending
payable:

The contract values of these financial instruments
approximate fair value.

Trading securities:

Fair values were based on current
market value where available. For securities for which market
values

Instruments

were not readily available, fair values were estimated using
quoted market prices of comparable investments.

Spot commodities:

Fair values are based on current market
prices.

Unrealized gains and losses on swaps, options and forward
transactions:

Fair values were based on the use of valuation
models that utilize, among other things, current interest,
foreign exchange commodity, equity and volatility rates, as
applicable.

Securities purchased (sold) under agreements to resell
(repurchase), at contract value:

As these securities
(obligations) are short-term in nature, the contract values
approximate fair values.

Other invested assets:

Consisting principally of hedge
funds and limited partnerships. Fair values are provided by the
general partner or manager of each investment.

Policyholders’ contract deposits:

Fair values were
estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based upon
interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts
with maturities consistent with those remaining for the
contracts being valued.

GIAs:

Fair values of AIG’s obligations under
investment type agreements were estimated using discounted cash
flow calculations based on interest rates currently being
offered for similar agreements with maturities consistent with
those remaining for the agreements being valued.

Securities and spot commodities sold but not yet
purchased:

The carrying amounts for the securities and spot
commodities sold but not yet purchased approximate fair values.
Fair values for spot commodities sold short were based on
current market prices.

Trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other
depositors:

To the extent certain amounts are not demand
deposits or certificates of deposit which mature in more than
one year, fair values were not calculated as AIG believes it
would have to expend excessive costs for the benefits derived.

Commercial paper:

The carrying amount approximates fair
value.

Notes, bonds, loans and mortgages:

Where practical, the
fair values of these obligations were estimated using discounted
cash flow calculations based upon AIG’s current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities
consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.

14. Stock Compensation
Plans

At December 31, 2005, AIG had five types of stock-based
compensation plans:

(i)

a stock option plan;

(ii)

an incentive stock plan under which restricted
stock units had been issued;

(iii)

an employee stock
purchase plan;

(iv)

SICO’s Deferred
Compensation Profit Participation Plan (SICO DCPPP) (consistent
with SICO’s change to equity settlement of selected
awards); and

(v)

AIG’s Deferred Compensation
Profit Participation Plan (AIG DCPPP) which is the replacement
for the SICO DCPPP.

Effective January 1, 2003, AIG adopted the recognition
provision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (FAS 123). This statement establishes
the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
employee compensation plans, such as AIG’s stock purchase
plan, stock option plan, stock incentive plan, SICO DCPPP, and
AIG DCPPP. Under the recognition provisions of FAS 123,
costs with respect to stock compensation are measured using the
fair value of the shares subscribed or granted as at the date of
grant recognized ratably over the vesting period. Such fair
value is derived through an option pricing model or the fair
value of AIG’s common stock, as applicable. See
Note 1(gg) herein for discussion of prospective change to
AIG’s accounting for retiree eligibility provisions.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FASB Statement
No. 123” (FAS 148), was issued in 2002. This
statement amended FAS 123 and provides alternative methods
of transition for a voluntary change to the recognition
provisions of FAS 123. Also, FAS 148 amended certain
of the disclosure requirements of FAS 123.

AIG elected the “Prospective Method” in the
application of the recognition provisions as prescribed by
FAS 123. Such method provides for the recognition of the
fair value with respect to stock-based compensation for shares
subscribed for or granted on or after January 1, 2003.

Prior to adoption of the recognition provisions of FAS 123,
as amended, AIG recognized stock compensation in accordance with
the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.” Shares subscribed for or
granted prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be accounted
for pursuant to APB Opinion No. 25. See Note 1(gg)
herein for discussion of AIG’s accounting for the unvested
portion of its APB 25 awards according to the requirements
of FAS 123R.

With respect to net income for
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, the following table
provides a pro forma reconciliation as if AIG had adopted the
recognition provisions of FAS 123 at the awards
inception:

AIG uses a binomial model to calculate the fair value of stock
option grants. The model uses ten years of historical exercise
behavior to account for the early exercise of employee options
and five years of historical stock price data to infer the
implied volatility. The fair-value model has been refined from
time to time since AIG adopted FAS 123 on January 1,
2003, but valuation results have been consistent from one
reporting period to the next.

The fair values of stock options granted during the three years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were approximately
$100 million, $80 million and $180 million,
respectively.

The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock
options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively: dividend
yields of 0.71 percent, 0.36 percent and
0.32 percent; expected volatility of 27.3 percent,
34.4 percent and 34.0 percent; risk-free interest
rates of 4.17 percent, 3.87 percent and
3.57 percent; and expected terms of seven years in
each year.

Also included in the above table is the compensation expense
with respect to AIG’s employee stock purchase plan. The
fair value calculated was derived by using the Black-Scholes
model. The pro forma recognition of such fair value had an
insignificant effect on the pro forma amounts disclosed above.

The fair values of purchase privileges granted during the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
$13 million, $12 million and $12 million,
respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of
those purchase rights granted in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were
$12.24, $14.82, and $11.64, respectively. The fair value of each
purchase right was derived at the date of the subscription using
the AIG model.

The following weighted average assumptions were used for
purchase privileges granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively: dividend yields of 0.71 percent,
0.36 percent and 0.32 percent; expected volatilities
of 27.3 percent, 34.4 percent and 34.0 percent;
risk-free interest rates of 3.37 percent, 1.60 percent
and 1.10 percent; and terms of one year.

(a) Stock Option Plan:

The AIG 1999 Stock Option
Plan, as amended (the 1999 Plan), provides that options to
purchase a maximum of 45,000,000 shares of common stock can be
granted to certain key employees and members of the Board of
Directors at prices not less than fair market value at the date
of grant. The 1999 Plan limits the maximum number of shares as
to which stock options may be granted to any employee in any one
year to 900,000 shares. Options granted under this Plan
expire not more than ten years from the date of the grant.
Options with respect to 32,500 shares, 25,000 shares,
25,000 shares, and 25,000 shares were granted to
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors on August 11,
2005, May 19, 2004, May 14, 2003 and February 10,
2003, respectively. These options become exercisable on the
first anniversary of the date of grant, expire ten years
from the date of grant, and do not qualify for Incentive Stock
Option Treatment under the Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code (ISO Treatment). The 1999 Plan, and the options
previously granted thereunder, were approved by the shareholders
at the 2000 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and certain
amendments were approved at the 2003 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. At December 31, 2005, 20,130,562 shares
were reserved for future grants under the 1999 Plan. The 1999
Plan superseded the 1991 employee stock option plan (the 1991
Plan) and the previously superseded 1987 employee stock option
plan, although outstanding options granted under the 1991 Plan
continue in force until exercise or expiration. At
December 31, 2005, there were 29,524,565 shares
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan and the 1991 Plan.

During 2003, AIG granted options with respect to
137,300 shares which become exercisable on the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant and expire ten years from
the date of grant. These options do not qualify for ISO
Treatment. The agreements with respect to all other options
granted to employees under these plans in 2004 and 2003 provide
that 25 percent of the options granted become exercisable on the
anniversary of the date of grant in each of the four years
following that grant and expire 10 years from the date of
the grant. As of December 31, 2005, outstanding options
granted with respect to 12,009,898 shares qualified for ISO
Treatment.

14. Stock Compensation
Plans

Continued

At January 1, 1999, the date of the AIG/SAI merger, SAI had
five stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which options,
restricted stock, and deferred share and share unit obligations
had been issued and remained outstanding. Options granted under
these plans had an exercise price equal to the market price on
the date of grant, had a maximum term of ten years, and
generally became exercisable ratably over a five-year period.
Substantially all of the SAI options outstanding at the merger
date became fully vested on that date and were converted into
options to purchase AIG common stock at the exchange ratio of
0.855 shares of AIG common stock for each share of SAI
common stock. No further options can be granted under the SAI
plans, but outstanding options so converted continue in force
until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2005, there
were 11,526,992 shares of AIG common stock reserved for
issuance on exercise of options under these plans. None of these
options qualified for ISO Treatment as of December 31, 2005.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, deferred share and share unit
obligations with respect to 1,895 shares, 1,895 shares
and 1,895 shares, respectively, of AIG common stock vested
and were issued. No additional deferred share or share unit
obligations may be granted under the SAI plans. As of
December 31, 2005, deferred share and share unit
obligations with respect to 59,972 shares remained
outstanding under the SAI plans.

The AIG Board of Directors has construed the AIG stock option
plans to allow, at the request of an optionee, the deferral of
delivery of AIG shares otherwise deliverable upon the
exercise of an option to a date or dates specified by the
optionee. During 2005, options with respect to 1,731,471 shares
were exercised with delivery deferred. At December 31,
2005, optionees had made valid elections to defer delivery of
2,067,643 shares of AIG common stock upon exercise of
options expiring during 2006. In addition, nonemployee directors
of AIG made valid elections to defer delivery of
21,093 shares of AIG common stock upon exercise of options
expiring during 2006.

As a result of the acquisition of the Hartford Steam Boiler
Inspection and Insurance Company (HSB) in November 2000, HSB
options outstanding at the acquisition date were fully vested
and were converted into options to purchase AIG common stock at
the exchange ratio of 0.4178 shares of AIG common stock for
each share of HSB common stock. No further options can be
granted under the HSB option plans, but outstanding options so
converted continue in force until exercise or expiration. At
December 31, 2005, there were 688,648 shares of AIG
common stock reserved for issuance under the HSB option plans,
none of which qualified for ISO Treatment.

At August 29, 2001, AGC had stock-based compensation plans
pursuant to which options and restricted share units had been
issued and remained outstanding. Options granted under these
plans had an exercise price equal to the market price on the
date of the grant, had a maximum term of ten years, and
generally became exercisable ratably over a three-year period.
All of the AGC options outstanding at the acquisition date
became fully vested on that date and were converted into options
to purchase AIG common stock at an exchange ratio of
0.5790 shares of AIG common stock for each share of AGC
common stock. No further options can be granted under the AGC
plans, but outstanding options so converted continue in force
until exercise or expiration. At December 31, 2005, there
were 10,805,219 shares of AIG common stock reserved for
issuance on exercise of options under these plans. Options with
respect to 1,250,221 of these shares qualified for ISO
Treatment as of December 31, 2005.

In addition, at December 31, 2005, options to purchase
92,241 shares at a weighted average exercise price of
$25.14 had been previously granted to AIG nonemployee directors
and remained outstanding.

Information about stock options
outstanding at December 31, 2005, is summarized as
follows:

(b) 2002 Stock Incentive Plan:

AIG’s 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan was adopted at its 2002 shareholders’
meeting and amended and restated by the AIG Board of Directors
on September 18, 2002. This plan provides that equity-based
or equity-related awards with respect to shares of common stock
can be issued to officers, employees or members of the Board of
Directors of AIG in any year up to a maximum of that number of
shares equal to (a) 1,000,000 shares plus (b) the
number of shares available but not issued in the prior calendar
year. Under the Plan, no grantee may receive awards covering
more than 250,000 shares of common stock. During 2005 and 2004,
AIG granted restricted stock units (RSUs) relating to
3,055,835 shares and 992,481 shares of common stock to
employees, respectively. These RSUs will vest on the fourth
anniversary of the date of grant assuming continued employment
through such date. See Note 1(gg) herein for discussion of
prospective change in AIG’s accounting for retiree
eligibility provisions. AIG reserves the right to make payment
for the RSUs in shares of common stock or the cash equivalent on
the date of vesting. AIG shares delivered under the AIG DCPPP
will be issued pursuant to the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. At
December 31, 2005, there were 14,675,635 shares of
common stock reserved for issuance in connection with future
grants of awards under the Plan.

(c) Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

AIG’s 1996
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and approved by AIG
shareholders in 2003 (the 1996 Plan), provides that
eligible employees (those employed at least one year) may
receive privileges to purchase up to an aggregate of
10,000,000 shares of AIG common stock, at a price equal to
85 percent of the fair market value on the date of the
grant of the purchase privilege. Purchase privileges are granted
annually and are limited to the number of whole shares that can
be purchased by an amount equal to 10 percent of an
employee’s annual salary or $10,000, whichever is less.
There were 359,750 shares, 922,999 shares and
516,904 shares issued under the 1996 plan at weighted
average prices of $57.06, $46.41 and $48.03 for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The excess
or deficit of the proceeds over the par value or cost of the
common stock issued was credited or charged to additional
paid-in capital.

As of December 31, 2005, there were 1,045,329 shares
of common stock subscribed to at a weighted average price of
$50.91 per share pursuant to grants of privileges under the
1996 plan. There were 3,689,063 shares available for the
grant of future purchase privileges under the 1996 Plan at
December 31, 2005.

As a result of its changing relationship with Starr and SICO,
AIG is establishing new executive compensation plans which
replace existing investment opportunities and deferred
compensation plans provided by Starr and SICO. The replacement
plans include both share-based plans as well as cash-based
plans. The share-based plans generally include performance as
well as service conditions.

15. Employee Benefits

(a) Pension Plans:

Employees of AIG, its
subsidiaries and certain affiliated companies, including
employees in foreign countries, are generally covered under
various funded, unfunded and insured pension plans. Eligibility
for participation in the various plans is based on either
completion of a specified period of continuous service or date
of hire, subject to age limitations. Some AIG subsidiaries
provide retirement benefits through defined benefit plans,
others employ defined contribution plans and some use both.

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

15. Employee Benefits

Continued

AIG’s U.S. retirement plan is a qualified, noncontributory
defined benefit plan which is subject to the provisions of
ERISA. All employees of AIG and most of its subsidiaries and
affiliates who are regularly employed in the United States,
including certain U.S. citizens employed abroad on a U.S. dollar
payroll, and who have attained age 21 and completed twelve
months of continuous service are eligible to participate in this
plan. An employee with 5 or more years of plan participation is
entitled to pension benefits beginning at normal retirement at
age 65. Benefits are based upon a percentage of average final
compensation multiplied by years of credited service limited to
44 years of credited service. The average final compensation is
subject to certain limitations. Employees may elect certain
options with respect to receipt of their pension benefits
including a joint and survivor annuity. An employee with 10 or
more years of plan participation may retire early from age 55 to
64. An early retirement factor is applied resulting in a reduced
benefit. If an employee terminates with less than five years of
plan participation, the employee forfeits the right to receive
any pension benefits accumulated to that time. Annual funding
requirements are determined based on the “projected unit
credit” cost method, which attributes a pro rata portion of
the total projected benefit payable at normal retirement to each
year of credited service.

The HSB retirement plan was merged into the AIG U.S. retirement
plan effective April 1, 2001. Benefits for HSB participants
were changed effective January 1, 2005 to be substantially
similar to the AIG U.S. retirement plan benefit subject to a
grandfathering agreement. The AGC retirement plan was merged
into the AIG U.S. retirement plan effective January 1,
2002. Benefits for AGC participants were changed effective
January 1, 2003 to be substantially similar to the AIG U.S.
retirement plan benefits subject to grandfathering requirements.

AIG SunAmerica employees began participation and accruing
benefits in the AIG plan on January 1, 2003. Vesting with
respect to AIG SunAmerica employees in the AIG plan begins on
the later of January 1, 1999, the date of acquisition or
the date of hire.

21st Century sponsors its own benefit plans for its eligible
employees. Assets, obligations and costs with respect to 21st
Century’s plans are included herein. The assumptions used
in its plans were not significantly different from those used by
AIG in AIG’s U.S. plans.

The AIG Excess Retirement Income Plan provides a benefit equal
to the reduction in benefits payable under the AIG U.S.
retirement plan as a result of federal tax limitations on
compensation and benefits payable thereunder. AIG has adopted a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Supplemental Plan) to
provide additional retirement benefits to designated executives.
Under the Supplemental Plan, an annual benefit accrues at a
percentage of final average pay multiplied by each year of
credited service, not greater than 60 percent of final average
pay, reduced by any benefits from the current and any
predecessor retirement plans (including the AIG Excess
Retirement Income Plan and any comparable plans), Social
Security, if any, and from any qualified pension plan of prior
employers. Currently, each of these plans is unfunded. AGC and
HSB have adopted similar supplemental type plans. These plans
are also unfunded.

Where non-U.S. retirement plans are defined benefit plans, they
are generally either based on the employees’ years of
credited service and compensation in the years preceding
retirement, or on points accumulated based on the
employee’s job grade and other factors during each year of
service.

(b) Postretirement Plans:

In addition to AIG’s
defined benefit pension plan, AIG and its subsidiaries provide a
postretirement benefit program for medical care and life
insurance domestically and in certain foreign countries.
Eligibility in the various plans is generally based upon
completion of a specified period of eligible service and
attaining a specified age. Overseas, benefits vary by geographic
location.

AIG’s U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits are based upon the employee electing immediate
retirement and having a minimum of ten years of service.
Retirees who were age 65 by May 1, 1989 and their
dependents participate in the medical plan at no cost. Employees
who retired after May 1, 1989 and prior to January 1,
1993 pay 50 percent of the active employee premium. Retiree
contributions are subject to adjustment annually. Other cost
sharing features of the medical plan include deductibles,
coinsurance and Medicare coordination and a lifetime maximum
benefit of $2.0 million. The maximum life insurance benefit
prior to age 70 is $32,500, with a maximum of $25,000
thereafter.

Effective January 1, 1993, both plans’ provisions were
amended. Employees who retire after January 1, 1993 are
required to pay the actual cost of the medical benefits premium
reduced by a credit of a certain amount, based on years of
service at retirement. The life insurance benefit varies by age
at retirement from $5,000 for retirement at ages 55 through
59; $10,000 for retirement at ages 60 through 64 and
$15,000 for retirement at ages 65 and over.

(c) Voluntary Savings Plans:

AIG sponsors a
voluntary savings plan for domestic employees (the AIG Incentive
Savings plan), which, during the three years ended
December 31, 2005, provided for salary reduction
contributions by employees and matching contributions by AIG of
up to seven percent of annual salary depending on the
employees’ years of service. Contributions are funded
currently.

AGC sponsored a voluntary savings plan for its employees, which
was merged into the AIG Incentive Savings plan on
January 1, 2003.

HSB sponsored a voluntary savings plan for its employees, which
was merged into the AIG Incentive Savings plan on
January 1, 2002.

AIG SunAmerica sponsored a voluntary savings plan for its
employees, which was merged into the AIG Incentive Savings
plan on January 1, 2003. Under an AIG SunAmerica Executive
Savings Plan, designated AIG SunAmerica executives also could
defer up to 90 percent of cash compensation

and AIG SunAmerica matched four percent of the
participants’ base salaries deferred. The Plan was frozen
to new contributions on March 31, 2003.

(d) Post Employment Benefits:

AIG provides certain
benefits to inactive employees who are not retirees. Certain of
these benefits are insured and expensed currently; other
expenses are provided for currently. Such uninsured expenses
include medical and life insurance continuation, and COBRA
medical subsidies.

(e) Benefit Obligations:

Accumulated benefit
obligations represent the present value of pension benefits
earned as of December 31, 2005 based on service and
compensation as of December 31, 2005. Projected benefit
obligations for defined benefit plans represent the present
value of pension benefits earned as of December 31, 2005
projected for estimated salary increases to an assumed date with
respect to retirement, termination, disability or death.
Projected benefit obligations for postretirement plans represent
the present value of postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits deemed earned as of December 31, 2005 projected
for estimated salary and medical claim rate increases to an
assumed date with respect to retirement, termination,
disability, or death.

The accumulated benefit obligations
with respect to both non-U.S. and U.S. pension benefit plans as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

The benefit obligations outside the United States reflect those
assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic
environments of each of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.

To measure the obligations at December 31, 2004, a
9.0 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered healthcare benefits for AIG’s U.S. plans
was used for 2005. This rate was assumed to decrease gradually
to 5.0 percent in 2009 and remain at that level thereafter.
To measure the obligations at December 31, 2005 for
AIG’s U.S. plans, a 9.0 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits for

pre-age

-65 retirees, a
7.0 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered medical benefits for

post-age

-65 retirees
and an 11.0 percent annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of retiree prescription drug coverage was used for
2006. These rates were assumed to decrease gradually to
5.0 percent in 2013 and remain at that level thereafter.

The assumed range for 2006 with respect to the annual rates of
increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits
of AIG’s non-U.S. plans is 7.0 to 9.0 percent. These
rates are assumed to decrease gradually to 4.0 to
5.0 percent after three to four years and remain at
that level thereafter.

A one percent point change in the
assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have the following

Discount Rate Methodology

The projected benefit cash flows under the AIG Retirement Plan
(the main US plan) were discounted using the spot rates derived
from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve as of
December 31, 2005 and an equivalent single discount rate
was derived resulting in the same liability. This single
discount rate was rounded to the nearest 25 basis points,
namely 5.5 percent, and applied to all U.S. plans.

Prior to using the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve in 2005, the
discount rate assumptions were based on the yield of the
Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) Aa long-term
corporate bond index.

Japan represents over 70 percent of the liabilities of the

non-U.S.

pension plans.
The discount rate for Japan was selected by reference to the
published Moody’s/S&P AA Corporate Bond Universe
at the measurement date having regard to the duration of the
plans’ liabilities.

The mortality assumption for AIG’s U.S. plans has been
revised for the December 31, 2005 obligations. The 2004 and
2005 expense and the obligations at December 31, 2004 were
based on the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table. The
December 31, 2005 obligations were based on the RP2000
White Collar Combined Mortality Table projected to 2006. Due to
continued improvements in life expectancy, the updated table is
expected to better represent AIG’s anticipated future
experience under the plans. The mortality assumptions for
AIG’s

non-U.S.

plans
vary by country. No changes have been made for the
December 31, 2005 obligations. The assumptions used are
expected to reasonably anticipate future mortality experience.

(f) Funded Status:

The funded status of the AIG
defined benefit plans is a comparison of the pension benefit
obligations to the assets related to the respective plan, if
any. The difference between the two represents amounts that have
been appropriately recognized as expenses in prior periods or
represent amounts that will be recognized as expenses in the
future.

(a)

A significant portion of these plans, particularly those in
    Japan, are not required by local regulation to be funded
    currently. With respect to the funded status of these Japanese
    plans, the projected benefit obligation amounts to approximately
    $410 million and $480 million and approximately
    $360 million and $400 million has been recognized at
    December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,

Included in equity securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004
were 0.6 million and 1.2 million shares of AIG common
stock, with values of $41.1 million and $79.3 million,
respectively.

The investment strategy with respect to AIG’s pension plan
assets is to preserve capital and to seek investment returns
with a goal of fully funding the plan.

The expected rate of return with respect to AIG’s domestic
pension plan was 8.0 percent and 8.25 percent for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These rates of return are an aggregation of
expected returns within each asset category. The return with
respect to each asset class considers both historical returns
and the future expectations for such returns.

(h) Expected Cash Flows:

With respect to AIG’s
U.S. pension plan, the actuarially prepared funding amount
ranges from the minimum amount AIG would be required to
contribute to the maximum amount that would be deductible for
U.S. tax purposes. This range is generally not determined
until the fourth quarter with respect to the contribution year.
Contributed amounts in excess of the minimum amounts are deemed
voluntary. Amounts in excess of the maximum amount would be
subject to an excise tax and may not be deductible under the
Internal Revenue Code. Supplemental and excess plans’
payments and postretirement plan payments are deductible when
paid.

AIG contributed $393 million during 2005 to its U.S. and
non-U.S. pension plans. The annual pension contribution for
2006 is expected to be approximately $70 million for U.S.
and non-U.S. plans.

The expected future benefit payments,
net of participants’ contributions with respect to the
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans, are as follows:

The weighted average assumptions used
to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 were as
follows:

*

The benefit obligations outside the United States reflect
    those assumptions that were most appropriate for each local
    economic environment of the subsidiaries providing such
    benefits.

AIG’s postretirement plans provide benefits primarily in
the form of defined employer contributions as opposed to defined
employer benefits. As such, a change in the assumed healthcare
cost trend rate has little effect on postretirement expense.

16. Benefits Provided by Starr
International Company, Inc.

SICO has provided a series of two-year Deferred Compensation
Profit Participation Plans (SICO Plans) to certain AIG
employees. The SICO Plans came into being in 1975 when the
voting shareholders and Board of Directors of SICO, a private
holding company whose principal asset is AIG common stock,
decided that a portion of the capital value of SICO should be
used to provide an incentive plan for the current and succeeding
managements of all American International companies, including
AIG.

None of the costs of the various benefits provided under the
SICO Plans has been paid by AIG, although AIG has recorded a
charge to reported earnings for the deferred compensation
amounts paid to AIG employees by SICO, with an offsetting entry
to additional paid-in capital reflecting amounts deemed
contributed by SICO. The SICO Plans provide that shares
currently owned by SICO may be set aside by SICO for the benefit
of the participant and distributed upon retirement. The SICO
Board of Directors currently may permit an early payout of units
under certain circumstances. Prior to payout, the participant is
not entitled to vote, dispose of or receive dividends with
respect to such shares, and shares are subject to forfeiture
under certain conditions, including but not limited to the
participant’s voluntary termination of employment with AIG
prior to normal retirement age. Under the SICO Plans,
SICO’s Board of Directors may elect to pay a participant
cash in lieu of shares of AIG common stock. Following
notification from SICO to participants in the SICO Plans that it
will settle specific future awards under the SICO Plans with
shares rather than cash, AIG modified its accounting for the
SICO Plans from variable to fixed measurement accounting.
AIG gave effect to this change in settlement method beginning on
December 9, 2005, the date of SICO’s notice to the
SICO Plans’ participants. See also Note 12(f) herein.

Prior to 2005, SICO also provided certain personal benefits to
AIG employees. The cost of such benefits, primarily attributable
to personal use of corporate aircraft, has not been included in
compensation expense.

Compensation expense with respect to the SICO Plans aggregated
$205 million, $62 million and $280 million for
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As a result of its changing relationship with Starr and SICO,
AIG is establishing new executive compensation plans to replace
the SICO plans and investment opportunities previously provided
by Starr. The replacement plans include both share-based plans
and cash-based plans. In addition, these replacement plans
generally include performance as well as service conditions.

According to the Schedule 13D
filed on March 7, 2006 by Starr, SICO, Edward E. Matthews,
Maurice R. Greenberg, the Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg
Family Foundation, Inc. and the Universal Foundation, Inc.,
these reporting persons may be deemed to beneficially own
396,124,637 shares of common stock. Based on the shares of
common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2005, this
ownership represents approximately 15 percent of the voting
stock of AIG.

(b) Transactions with Related Parties:

During the
ordinary course of business during 2005, AIG and its
subsidiaries paid commissions to Starr and its subsidiaries for
the production and management of insurance business. There are
no significant receivables from/payables to related parties at
December 31, 2005. Payment for the production of insurance
business to Starr aggregated approximately $214 million in
2005, $205 million in 2004, and $173 million in 2003,
from which Starr generally is required to pay commissions due to
originating brokers and its operating expenses. AIG also
received approximately $23 million in 2005,
$24 million in 2004, and $24 million in 2003 from
Starr and paid approximately $20,000 in 2005, $39,000 in 2004,
and $114,000 in 2003 to Starr in rental fees and for services
none in 2005, $262,000 in 2004 and 2003. AIG also received
approximately $2 million in 2005, $1 million in 2004,
and $2 million in 2003, respectively, from SICO and paid
approximately $1 million in each of the years 2005, 2004
and 2003 to SICO as reimbursement for services rendered at cost.
AIG also paid to SICO $3 million in 2005, $4 million
in 2004, and $4 million in 2003 in rental fees.

19. Variable Interest
Entities

In January 2003, FASB issued FIN46. FIN46 changed the method of
determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in
AIG’s consolidated financial statements. An entity is
subject to FIN46 and is called a Variable Interest Entity (VIE)
if it has (i) equity that is insufficient to permit the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties, or (ii) equity
investors that cannot make significant decisions about the
entity’s operations, or that do not absorb the expected
losses or receive the expected returns of the entity. A VIE is
consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party that
has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the
expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. All other
entities not considered VIEs are evaluated for consolidation
under other guidance. In December 2003, FASB issued a revision
to Interpretation No. 46 (FIN46R).

The provisions of FIN46R had to be applied immediately to VIEs
created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which AIG
obtains an interest after that date. For VIEs in which AIG held
a variable interest that it acquired before February 1,
2003, FIN46R was applied as of December 31, 2003. For any
VIEs that were consolidated under FIN46R that were created
before February 1, 2003, the assets, liabilities and
noncontrolling interest of the VIEs were initially measured at
their fair values with any difference between the net amount
added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized
interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an
accounting change. In accordance with the transition provisions
of FIN46R, AIG recorded a gain of $9 million
($14 million before tax) reported as a cumulative effect of
an accounting change for the fourth

quarter of 2003 and added approximately $4.7 billion of
assets and liabilities to its consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2003.

Of the $4.7 billion, approximately $4.2 billion
relates to assets and liabilities arising from AIG’s real
estate partnerships, principally affordable housing transactions
involving AIG SunAmerica subsidiaries, and private equity
partnerships managed by AIG Global Investment Group and AIG
Capital Partners.

SunAmerica Affordable Housing Partners, Inc. (SAAHP) organizes
limited partnerships that are considered to be VIEs, and that
are consolidated by AIG. The partnerships invest as limited
partners in operating partnerships that develop and operate low
income housing and a smaller number of market rate properties
across the United States. The general partners in the operating
partnerships are almost exclusively unaffiliated third-party
developers. AIG does not generally consolidate an operating
partnership if the general partner is an unaffiliated person.
Through approximately 1,000 partnerships, SAAHP has invested in
developments with approximately 147,000 apartment units
nationwide, and has syndicated over $5 billion in
partnership equity since 1991 to other investors who will
receive, among other benefits, tax credits under certain
sections of the Internal Revenue Code. AIG Retirement Services,
Inc. functions as the general partner in certain limited
partnerships and acts as both a credit enhancer in certain
transactions, through differing structures with respect to
funding development costs for the operating partnerships, and as
guarantor that investors will receive the tax benefits projected
at the time of syndication. As part of their incentive
compensation, certain key SAAHP employees have been awarded
residual cash flow interests in the partnerships, subject to
certain vesting requirements. The operating income of SAAHP is
reported, along with other SunAmerica partnership income, as a
component of AIG’s Asset Management segment.

The remaining approximately $500 million involves ILFC, and
arises principally from a sale-leaseback transaction which
expired during 2004.

AIGFP is involved with various special purpose vehicles in the
ordinary course of business that may be deemed VIEs and may hold
variable interests therein. The variable interests that AIGFP
may hold include debt securities, equity interests, loans,
derivative instruments and other credit support arrangements.
Transactions associated with these entities include an
asset-backed commercial paper conduit, asset securitizations,
collateralized debt obligations, investment vehicles and other
structured financial transactions. AIGFP engages in these
transactions to facilitate client needs, for investment purposes
and to obtain attractive funding.

As of December 31, 2005, AIGFP was the primary beneficiary
in the following VIEs:

-

An asset-backed commercial paper
    conduit, with which it entered into several total return swaps
    covering all the conduit’s assets that absorb the majority
    of the expected losses of the entity. The total assets of the
    conduit that serve as collateral to the conduit’s
    obligations that are reflected in AIG’s consolidated
    balance sheet at December 31, 2005 were $5.9 billion.

-

Several structured financing
    transactions in which AIGFP held the first loss position either
    by investing in the equity of the entity or implicitly through a
    lending or derivative arrangement. The total assets of these
    entities that are reflected in AIG’s consolidated balance
    sheet at December 31, 2005 were $1.6 billion. The
    obligations of these entities are paid solely from the cash
    flows of the assets held by the VIEs.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, AIG’s consolidated
balance sheet included approximately $11.8 billion and
$8.1 billion of assets and liabilities connected to
entities consolidated under FIN46R.

The following VIE activities are not consolidated by AIG under
FIN46R:

-

AIG uses VIEs primarily in
    connection with certain guaranteed investment contract programs
    (GIC Programs) written by its Life Insurance &
    Retirement Services subsidiaries. In the GIC Programs,
    AIG’s Life Insurance subsidiaries (principally SunAmerica
    Life Insurance Company) provide guaranteed investment contracts
    to VIEs which are not controlled by AIG, and in which AIG does
    not have a direct variable interest, as defined under FIN46R, in
    the entity. The VIE issues notes or bonds which are sold to
    third-party institutional investors. Neither AIG nor the
    insurance company issuing the GICs has any obligation to the
    investors in the notes or bonds. The proceeds from the
    securities issued by the VIE are invested by the VIE in the
    GICs. The insurance company subsidiaries use the proceeds to
    invest in a diversified portfolio of securities, primarily
    investment grade bonds. Both the assets and the liabilities of
    the insurance companies arising from these GIC Programs are
    presented in AIG’s consolidated balance sheet. Thus, at
    December 31, 2005, approximately $37 billion of
    policyholders’ contract deposits represented liabilities
    from issuances of GICs included in these GIC Programs, the
    proceeds of which are used to invest in insurance invested
    assets.

-

AIG manages Collateralized Bond
    and Loan Obligation trusts (collectively, Collateralized Debt
    Obligation trusts or CDO trusts). As asset manager, AIG receives
    fees for management of the assets held in the CDO trust, which
    support the issuance of securities sold by the CDO trust. AIG
    may take minority equity and/or fixed-income security interests
    in the CDO trust. AIG has entered into such arrangements to
    expand its asset management activities. Third-party investors
    have recourse only to the CDO trust and have no recourse to AIG.

-

AIG’s insurance operations
    also invest in obligations of VIEs. These VIEs are established
    by unrelated third parties. Investments include collateralized
    mortgage backed securities and similar securities backed by
    pools of mortgages, consumer receivables, or other assets. The
    investment in these VIEs allows AIG’s insurance entities to
    purchase assets permitted by insurance regulations while
    maximizing their return on these assets.

AIGFP has significant variable interests in various transactions
where AIGFP is not the primary beneficiary. These transactions
consist principally of structured financings, in which AIGFP
owns an investment interest or is a lender, financial
derivatives or credit support provider. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the total assets of these entities were
$29.9 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively.
AIGFP’s maximum exposure to loss in these transactions, at
December 31, 2005, was $15.1 billion in the aggregate.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties
with returns linked to or “derived” from some
underlying equity, debt, commodity or other asset, liability, or
index. Derivative payments may be based on interest rates and
exchange rates and/or prices of certain securities, commodities,
or financial or commodity indices or other variables. These
instruments are carried at fair value in the consolidated
balance sheet. Collateral is required, at the discretion of AIG,
on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the
counterparty.

The overwhelming majority of AIG’s derivatives activities
are conducted by the Capital Markets operations. AIGFP becomes a
party to derivative financial instruments in the normal course
of business and to reduce currency, interest rate, commodity,
and equity exposures. Interest rate, currency, commodity, and
equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements and are carried at a market or
a fair value, whichever is appropriate. The recorded estimated
fair values of such instruments may be different from the values
that might be realized if AIGFP was required to sell or close
out the transactions prior to maturity.

AIGFP, in the ordinary course of operations and as principal,
structures and enters into derivative transactions to meet the
needs of counterparties who may be seeking to hedge certain
aspects of such counterparties’ operations or obtain a
desired financial exposure. AIGFP also enters into derivative
transactions to hedge the financial exposures arising from its
counterparty transactions. Such derivative transactions include
interest rate, currency, commodity, credit and equity swaps,
swaptions, and forward commitments. Interest rate swap
transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and
floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange
of the underlying principal amounts. AIGFP typically becomes a
principal in the exchange of interest payments between the
parties and, therefore, is exposed to counterparty credit risk
and may be exposed to loss, if counterparties default. Currency,
commodity, and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps,
but involve the exchange of specific currencies or cashflows
based on the underlying commodity, equity securities or indices.
Also, they may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the
beginning and end of the transaction. Swaptions are options
where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter
into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction.
At December 31, 2005, the aggregate notional principal
amount of AIGFP’s outstanding swap transactions
approximated $1,224 billion, primarily related to interest
rate swaps of approximately $837.4 billion.

Notional amount represents a standard of measurement of the
volume of swaps business of Capital Markets operations. Notional
amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and
is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Notional
amounts generally represent those amounts used to calculate
contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or
received, except for certain contracts such as currency swaps.

The timing and the amount of cash flows relating to Capital
Markets foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures
and options contracts are determined by each of the respective
contractual agreements.

manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the

offsetting transactions with third-party market participants.

Risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices

AIGFP enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary
course of its business. The majority of AIGFP’s credit
derivatives require AIGFP to provide credit protection on a
designated portfolio of loans or debt securities. AIGFP provides
such credit protection on a “second loss” basis, under
which AIGFP’s payment obligations arise only after credit
losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold
amount or level of “first losses.” The threshold
amount of credit losses that must be realized before AIGFP has
any payment obligation is negotiated by AIGFP for each
transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment
obligation by AIGFP under each transaction is remote, even in
severe recessionary market scenarios.

In certain cases, the credit risk associated with a designated
portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk, which are
then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies.
Typically, there will be an equity layer covering the first
credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified
percentage of the total portfolio, and then successive layers
that are rated, generally a BBB-rated layer, an A-rated layer,
an AA-rated layer, and an AAA-rated layer. In transactions that
are rated, the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior
to the threshold level above which AIGFP’s payment
obligation would generally arise is rated AAA by the rating
agencies. In transactions that are not rated, AIGFP applies the
same risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its
payment obligations. Therefore the risk layer assumed by AIGFP
with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions
is often called the “super senior” risk layer, defined
as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been
rated AAA by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is
not rated, equivalent thereto. For example, in a transaction
with an equity layer covering credit losses from zero to
two percent of the total portfolio, a BBB-rated layer
covering credit losses from two to four percent, an A-rated
layer from four to six percent, an AA-rated layer from six
to eight percent, and a AAA-rated layer from eight to
11 percent. AIGFP would cover credit losses arising in
respect of the portfolio that exceeded an 11 percent first
loss threshold amount and thereby bear risk that is senior to
the AAA-rated risk layer.

AIGFP continually monitors the underlying portfolios to
determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular
portfolio has caused the likelihood of AIGFP having a payment
obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior
risk. AIGFP maintains the ability opportunistically to
economically hedge specific securities in a portfolio and
thereby further limit its exposure to loss and has hedged
outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion. AIGFP has
never had a payment obligation under these credit derivatives
transactions where AIGFP is providing credit protection on the
super senior risk. Furthermore, based on portfolio credit losses
experienced as of December 31, 2005 under all such
outstanding transactions, no transaction has experienced credit
losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of AIGFP having
to make a payment, in AIGFP’s view, to be greater than
remote, even in severe recessionary market scenarios. At
December 31, 2005, the notional amount with respect to the
Capital Markets credit derivative portfolio (including the super
senior transactions) was $387.2 billion.

AIGFP utilizes various credit enhancements, including letters of
credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit
derivatives, and margin agreements to reduce the credit exposure
relating to derivative financial instruments. AIGFP requires
credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions
based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the
counterparties, and the transaction’s size and maturity. In
addition, Capital Markets derivative transactions are generally
documented under ISDA Master Agreements. Management believes
that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off and
close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties. Under
such agreements, in connection with an early termination of a
transaction, AIGFP is permitted to set-off its receivables from

agreements. After consideration of these credit enhancements,
the fair value of AIGFP’s interest rate, currency,
commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward
commitments, futures, and forward contracts approximated
$18.70 billion at December 31, 2005 and
$22.67 billion at December 31, 2004. These amounts
have been determined in accordance with the respective close-out
netting provisions under the applicable ISDA Master Agreements.
The fair value represents the maximum potential loss to AIGFP.

AIGFP independently evaluates the creditworthiness of its
counterparties, taking into account credit ratings assigned by
recognized statistical rating organizations. In addition,
AIGFP’s credit approval process involves pre-set
counterparty and country credit exposure limits and, for
particularly credit intensive transactions, obtaining approval
from AIG’s Credit Risk Committee. AIGFP estimates that the
average credit rating of Capital Markets derivatives
counterparties, measured by reference to the fair value of its
derivative portfolio as a whole, is equivalent to the AA rating
category. The maximum potential loss will increase or decrease
during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of
maturity and market conditions.

Capital Markets determines counterparty
credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating
agencies or, where such ratings are not available, by internal
analysis. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the counterparty
credit quality with respect to the fair value of Capital Markets
derivatives portfolios were as follows:

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the fair
value of Capital Markets derivatives portfolio was as
follows:

FAS 133 requires that third-party derivatives used for
hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying
exposures to an outside third party and documented
contemporaneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In
many cases, AIG did not meet these hedging requirements with
respect to certain hedging transactions. Not meeting the
requirements of FAS 133 does not result in any changes in
AIG’s liquidity or its overall financial condition even
though inter-period volatility of earnings is increased.

AIG and its subsidiaries also use derivatives and other
instruments as part of its financial risk management programs.
Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used
to manage interest rate risk associated with its investments in
fixed income securities, commercial paper issuances, medium and
long-term note offerings, and other interest rate sensitive
assets and liabilities. In addition, foreign exchange
derivatives (principally cross currency swaps, forwards and
options) are used to economically hedge non-U.S. dollar
denominated debt, net capital exposures and foreign exchange
transactions. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of
the exposures they are meant to offset. For accounting purposes,
a limited number of these derivatives have been designated as
hedging instruments under FAS 133. The effect on earnings
from those derivatives that have been designated as hedges is
insignificant for 2005 and 2004.

Variable Life and Annuity
    Contracts

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants issued Statement of Position 03-1,
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for
Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
Accounts”
(SOP

03-1).

This
Statement was effective January 1, 2004, and requires AIG
to recognize a liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits
and other living benefits related to its variable annuity and
variable life contracts and modifies certain disclosures and
financial statement presentations for these products. AIG
reported for the first quarter of 2004 a one-time

cumulative accounting charge upon adoption of $144 million
to reflect the liability as of January 1, 2004.

As of January 1, 2004, approximately $11 billion of
assets and liabilities representing most of the non-U.S. portion
of AIG’s separate and variable account assets and
liabilities were reclassified in accordance with
SOP

03-1

to
several invested asset captions and to the Policyholders’
contract deposits liability caption, respectively. Approximately
$11 billion of separate and variable account assets were
reclassified as follows: $4 billion to Short-term
investments; $4 billion to Equity securities –
common stocks trading; $2 billion to Fixed
maturities – bond trading securities; and
$1 billion to various other asset captions.

Except as noted above, AIG reports variable contracts through
separate and variable accounts when investment income and
investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment
risk is borne by, the contract holder (traditional variable
annuities). AIG also reports variable annuity and life contracts
through separate and variable accounts where AIG contractually
guarantees to the contract holder (variable contracts with
guarantees) either

(a)

total deposits made to the
contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (and
in minor instances, no minimum returns) (Net Deposits Plus a
Minimum Return) or

(b)

the highest contract value
attained, typically on any anniversary date minus any subsequent
withdrawals following the contract anniversary (Highest Contract
Value Attained). These guarantees include benefits that are
payable in the event of death, annuitization, or, in other
instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period.
Such benefits are referred to as guaranteed minimum death
benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), and
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB), or guaranteed
minimum account value benefits (GMAV), respectively. For AIG,
GMDB is by far the most widely offered benefit.

The assets supporting the variable portion of both traditional
variable annuities and variable contracts with guarantees are
carried at fair value and reported as summary total separate and
variable account assets with an equivalent summary total
reported for liabilities. Amounts assessed against the contract
holders for mortality, administrative, and other services are
included in revenue and changes in liabilities for minimum
guarantees are included in policyholder benefits in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. Separate and variable account
net investment income, net investment gains and losses, and the
related liability changes are offset within the same line item
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The vast majority of AIG’s
exposure on guarantees made to variable contract holders arises
from GMDB. Details concerning AIG’s GMDB exposures as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

(a)

    Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(b)

The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating
the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected
account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the
accumulation period based on total expected assessments. AIG
regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional
liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit
expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier assumptions should be revised.

The following assumptions and methodology were used to determine
the domestic and foreign GMDB liability as of December 31,
2005:

-

Data used was up to 5,000
    stochastically generated investment performance scenarios.

-

Mean investment performance
    assumptions ranged from approximately three percent to
    ten percent depending on the block of business.

-

Volatility assumptions ranged from
    10 percent to 30 percent depending on the block of
    business.

-

Mortality was assumed at between
    60 percent and 103 percent of various life and annuity
    mortality tables.

For domestic contracts, lapse
    rates vary by contract type and duration and ranged from zero

-

For domestic contracts, the
    discount rate ranged from 3.25 percent to 11 percent.
    For Japan, the discount rate ranged from zero percent to
    seven percent.

In addition to GMDB, AIG’s contracts currently include to a
lesser extent GMIB. The GMIB liability is determined each period
end by estimating the expected value of the annuitization
benefits in excess of the projected account balance at the date
of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably over the
accumulation period based on total expected assessments. AIG
regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional
liability balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit
expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier assumptions should be revised. As of December 31,
2005, most of AIG’s GMIB exposure was transferred via
reinsurance agreements. Contracts with GMIB not reinsured have
account values of $2.8 billion with a corresponding reserve
of less than $1 million.

AIG contracts currently include a minimal amount of GMAV and
GMWB. GMAV and GMWB are considered to be derivatives and are
recognized at fair value through earnings. AIG enters into
derivative contracts to partially hedge the economic exposure
that arises from GMAV and GMWB.

Changes and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure

There have been no changes in accountants during the twenty-four
months ended December 31, 2005.

ITEM 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form

10-K,

an
evaluation was carried out by AIG’s management, with the
participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of AIG’s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)) as of
December 31, 2005. Disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.

During the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as
of December 31, 2004 conducted during the preparation of
AIG’s financial statements to be included in the 2004
Form

10-K,

five
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting
were identified, relating to control environment, controls over
the evaluation of risk transfer, controls over certain balance
sheet reconciliations, controls over the accounting for certain
derivative transactions and controls over income tax accounting.
As a result, AIG’s new Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2004,
AIG’s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.

Upon identification of the material weaknesses and under the
direction of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, AIG developed a comprehensive plan to remediate the
material weaknesses.

AIG’s remediation efforts were governed by a Steering
Committee, under the direction of AIG’s Chief Risk Officer
and also including AIG’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer, Comptroller and Senior Vice President for
Strategic Planning. The status of remediation of each material
weakness was reviewed with the Audit Committee and this
Committee was advised of issues encountered and key decisions
reached by AIG management relating to the remediation efforts.

On November 9, 2005, AIG announced that it had identified
certain errors, the preponderance of which were identified
during the remediation of the material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting described above, principally
relating to controls over accounting for certain derivative
transactions and related assets and liabilities under
FAS 133, reconciliation of certain balance sheet accounts
and income tax accounting. Subsequent to that announcement, and
in connection with its ongoing remediation efforts, AIG
identified certain additional errors principally relating to
internal controls over reconciliation of certain balance sheet
accounts in the Domestic Brokerage Group. Due to the
significance of these additional errors, AIG restated its
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, along with 2001 and 2000 for purposes of preparation of
the Selected Consolidated Financial Data for 2001 and 2000, and
quarterly financial information for 2004 and 2003 and will
restate the first three quarters of 2005 (the Second
Restatement). AIG’s September 2005
Form

10-Q

will not
be amended because the adjustments to correct the additional
errors to the financial statements included therein are not
material to those financial statements.

As of December 31, 2005 and as described under Remediation
of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting below, the material weaknesses relating to the control
environment and controls over the evaluation of risk transfer
were remediated, and the material weaknesses relating to
controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations, controls
over the accounting for certain derivative transactions and
controls over income tax accounting remained, as they were not
fully remediated.

As a result of these remaining material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting, described more fully below,
AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, AIG’s
disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.

Notwithstanding the existence of these three remaining material
weaknesses, AIG believes that the consolidated financial
statements in this Annual Report on
Form

10-K

fairly
present, in all material respects, AIG’s financial
condition as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and results of
its operations and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Management of AIG is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
AIG’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process, under the supervision of AIG’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of AIG’s financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

AIG management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of
AIG’s internal control over financial reporting as of

AIG

-

Form

10-K


December 31, 2005 based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of AIG’s annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
AIG management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005,
the following material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting remained:

Controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations:

AIG
did not maintain effective controls to ensure the accuracy of
certain balance sheet accounts in certain key segments of
AIG’s operations, principally in the Domestic Brokerage
Group. Specifically, accounting personnel did not perform timely
reconciliations and did not properly resolve reconciling items
for premium receivables, reinsurance recoverables and
intercompany accounts. As a result, premiums and other
considerations, incurred policy losses and benefits, insurance
acquisition and other operating expenses, premiums and insurance
balances receivable, reinsurance assets, reserves for losses and
loss expenses, reserve for unearned premiums, other assets and
retained earnings were misstated under GAAP.

Controls over the accounting for certain derivative
transactions:

AIG did not maintain effective controls over
the evaluation and documentation of whether certain derivative
transactions qualified under GAAP for hedge accounting. As a
result, net investment income, realized capital gains (losses),
other revenues, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
and related balance sheet accounts were misstated under GAAP.

Controls over income tax accounting:

AIG did not maintain
effective controls over the determination and reporting of
certain components of the provision for income taxes and related
income tax balances. Specifically, AIG did not maintain
effective controls to review and monitor the accuracy of the
components of the income tax provision calculations and related
income tax balances and to monitor the differences between the
income tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and
liabilities to effectively reconcile the differences to the
deferred income tax balances. As a result, income tax expense,
income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities, retained earnings and accumulated other
comprehensive income were misstated under GAAP.

The control deficiencies described above resulted in the Second
Restatement. In addition, these control deficiencies could
result in other misstatements to the aforementioned financial
statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a
material misstatement to the annual or interim AIG consolidated
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, AIG management has concluded that these control
deficiencies constitute material weaknesses.

As a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting described above, AIG management has
concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, AIG’s
internal control over financial reporting was not effective
based on the criteria in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of AIG’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in
this Annual Report on
Form

10-K.

Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Throughout 2005 and continuing in 2006, AIG has been actively
engaged in the implementation of remediation efforts to address
the five material weaknesses in existence at December 31,
2004 and disclosed in its 2004
Form

10-K.

These
remediation efforts, outlined below, are specifically designed
to address the material weaknesses identified by AIG management.
As a result of its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, AIG management determined that
as of December 31, 2005, two material weaknesses, relating
to the control environment and controls over the evaluation of
risk transfer, had been remediated, and three material
weaknesses, relating to the controls over certain balance sheet
reconciliations, controls over the accounting for certain
derivative transactions and controls over income tax accounting,
had not been remediated.

Completed Remediation

Control environment:

As of December 31, 2004,
certain of AIG’s controls within its control environment
were not effective to prevent certain members of senior
management, including the former Chief Executive Officer and
former Chief Financial Officer, from having the ability, which
in certain instances was utilized, to override certain controls
and effect certain transactions and accounting entries.

AIG has taken several significant actions to improve its control
environment, starting with the appointment of new senior
management with a new tone and philosophy. AIG’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, together with
other senior executives, are committed to achieving transparency
and clear communication with all stakeholders through effective
corporate governance, a strong control environment, high ethical
standards and financial reporting integrity. To strengthen and
enhance its overall financial reporting and internal control
environment, AIG has increased resources for technical
accounting, internal audit, enterprise risk management and
compliance functions, hired additional staff with specialized
financial and accounting expertise, and established stronger
reporting lines within the financial reporting function.

Among the specific actions taken by AIG to remediate this
material weakness and to further strengthen overall controls
over financial reporting were the following:

AIG has established a Financial Disclosure Committee to assist
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in
fulfilling their responsibilities for oversight of the accuracy
and timeliness of the disclosures made by AIG.


AIG

-

Form

10-K

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

AIG has implemented new controls, including specific procedures
with respect to post-closing adjustments and consolidating
entries.

AIG has taken remedial actions with respect to certain employees
in management and in the underwriting, accounting, auditing,
actuarial and financial reporting functions. Such remedial
actions included further training and supervision, reassignment
outside areas of involvement with financial reporting, or
termination. Employees identified as needing further training
and supervision underwent formal ethics training and recertified
their compliance with AIG’s Code of Conduct.

AIG now requires that all employees complete formal ethics
training developed and monitored by AIG Corporate Compliance.
AIG has implemented a

Director, Executive Officer and Senior
Financial Officer Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,

and
requires all members of the Board of Directors, executive
officers and senior financial officers to confirm that they
adhere to the stated principles and procedures set forth in that
Code.

AIG has strengthened the position of Chief Risk Officer,
responsible for enterprise-wide credit, market, and operational
risk management and oversight of the corresponding functions at
the business unit level and has empowered the Chief Risk Officer
to work more closely with top executives at the corporate and
major business unit levels to identify, assess, quantify, manage
and mitigate risks to AIG.

AIG has established an Operational Risk Management department,
reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, to engage in expanded risk
self-assessment processes for more effective identification and
management of operational and reputational risks.

The AIG Board of Directors has established the Regulatory,
Compliance and Legal Committee to provide oversight of
AIG’s compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
AIG’s Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to
this Committee, has implemented a corporate level,
centrally-managed compliance function and developed a compliance
framework, within which AIG is implementing consistent
compliance policies and procedures for all major business units.

AIG has expanded the scope and activities of the corporate level
Complex Structured Finance Transaction Committee, to review and
approve transactions that could subject AIG to heightened legal,
reputational, regulatory or other risk or enable a third party
to achieve an accounting or financial reporting result
inconsistent with applicable accounting principles, to include
the review and approval of AIG’s accounting and financial
reporting of identified transactions, including related party
transactions. Also, AIG’s major business units have
implemented their own committees and processes to enhance their
ability to identify, analyze and present for approval complex
structured finance transactions to AIG’s corporate level
committee.

Although AIG continues to develop further enhancements to its
control environment, based upon the significant actions taken,
as listed above, and the testing and evaluation of the
effectiveness of the controls, AIG management has concluded that
remediation of the material weakness in AIG’s control
environment has been achieved as of December 31, 2005.

Controls over the evaluation of risk transfer:

As of
December 31, 2004, AIG did not maintain effective controls
over the proper evaluation, documentation and disclosure of
whether certain insurance and reinsurance transactions in the
General Insurance segment involved sufficient risk transfer to
qualify for insurance and reinsurance accounting.

To remediate this material weakness, AIG has developed a formal
risk transfer policy for direct insurance, assumed reinsurance
and ceded reinsurance in the General Insurance segment. This
policy establishes guidelines for the assessment by the
underwriting, and if appropriate, actuarial functions, of the
adequacy of risk transfer to support insurance accounting, and
requires that appropriate documentation of the assessment be
provided to the accounting function to allow proper accounting
for the transaction.

AIG has also established procedures to incorporate risk transfer
assessments into its underwriting and financial audit processes.
Although AIG continues to refine and enhance its controls over
the evaluation of risk transfer, including developing a process
for updating the risk transfer policy to reflect changes in
accounting pronouncements, based upon the significant actions
taken, as listed above, and the testing and evaluation of the
effectiveness of the controls, AIG management has concluded that
remediation of this material weakness has been achieved as of
December 31, 2005.

Continuing Remediation

AIG has devoted significant efforts towards remediation of its
three remaining material weaknesses, and remediation of
AIG’s control environment has aided in these efforts.
Nonetheless, these material weaknesses are not yet fully
remediated as of December 31, 2005. AIG management
continues to assign the highest priority to AIG’s
remediation efforts in these areas, with the goal of remediating
these material weaknesses by year-end 2006. However, due to the
nature of the remediation process and the need to allow adequate
time after implementation to evaluate and test the effectiveness
of the controls, no assurance can be given as to the timing of
achievement of remediation. AIG recognizes that further
improvement in its internal control over financial reporting and
consolidation processes is essential. Over time, AIG intends to
reduce its reliance on the utilization of consultants to
supplement current resources and the manual controls that have
been established. As part of its remediation efforts, AIG
intends to develop new systems and processes which will allow it
to rely on front end preventative controls which will be more
sustainable over the long term. AIG recognizes that to
accomplish its goals, further strengthening and investment are
needed in accounting and tax personnel, as well as in systems
and processes. AIG is committed to making the investments
necessary to make these improvements.

AIG has taken specific remediation steps with respect to its
three remaining material weaknesses.

Controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations:

AIG
has implemented the following measures to enhance its ability to

AIG

-

Form

10-K


identify, assess, measure and help to ensure the accuracy of its
balance sheet accounts:

-

adoption and implementation of new
    corporate guidelines on balance sheet reconciliations;

-

implementation of new programs to
    train staff on the requirements of the new guidelines;

-

enhancement of the oversight of
    the balance sheet reconciliation function by adding qualified
    staff and engaging outside resources; and

-

enhancement of processes for
    evaluating and monitoring financial statement exposures related
    to balance sheet reconciliations.

AIG’s remediation efforts during 2005 with respect to its
controls over certain balance sheet reconciliations identified
additional errors, contributing to the Second Restatement. Thus,
AIG management believes that full remediation has not yet been
achieved.

Controls over the accounting for certain derivative
transactions:

AIG has taken the following actions to
remediate this material weakness:

-

enhancement of systems and
    implementation of new controls over the accounting for
    derivatives and related assets and liabilities;

-

implementation of new procedures
    and controls to ensure technical compliance with the provisions
    of FAS 133, including specific documentation requirements,
    prior to application of hedge accounting by AIG
    subsidiaries; and

-

establishment of improved
    oversight, monitoring and supervision of derivative accounting
    issues in part, through the hiring of additional personnel with
    expertise in FAS 133.

AIG’s remediation efforts with respect to its controls over
the accounting for certain derivative transactions resulted in
identification of previously undetected errors that contributed
to the Second Restatement. Thus, AIG management believes that
full remediation has not yet been achieved, and testing will
continue to ensure that processes and controls over the
accounting for derivative transactions are operating effectively
before hedge accounting is applied again.

Controls over income tax accounting:

AIG has taken the
following actions to remediate this material weakness:

-

implementation of new controls
    over its accounting for income taxes;

-

enhancement of its oversight over
    income tax accounting through hiring of additional qualified
    staff;

-

engagement of an outside
    accounting firm to assist in the analysis of its income tax
    accounting; and

-

enhancement of processes for
    evaluating and monitoring financial statement exposure related
    to income tax accounting.

AIG’s remediation efforts during 2005 with respect to its
controls over income tax accounting identified additional
errors, contributing to the Second Restatement. Thus, AIG
management believes that remediation has not yet been achieved.
