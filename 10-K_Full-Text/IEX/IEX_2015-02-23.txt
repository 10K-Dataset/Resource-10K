Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

For an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors present risks to the Company and could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant of these factors are as follows:

Changes in U.S. or International Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect the Sales and Profitability of  Our Businesses.

In


,

50%

of the Company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while

50%

were derived from international operations. The Company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies, fire and rescue, liquefied petroleum gas, paint and coatings, chemical processing, water & wastewater treatment and optical filters and components. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy and, in particular, any of these specific end markets could reduce the Company’s sales and profitability.

Conditions in Foreign Countries in Which We Operate Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

In


, approximately

50%

of our total sales were to customers outside the U.S. We expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. These risks include the following:

•

possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;

•

risks of economic instability;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;

•

disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;

•

changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements; and,

•

insurrection or war.

Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.

Our Inability to Continue to Develop New Products Could Limit Our Sales Growth.

The Company’s sales grew

5%

organically in


and 2% in


. Approximately

12%

of our


sales were derived from new products developed over the past three years. Our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products.

Our Growth Strategy Includes Acquisitions and We May Not be Able to Make Acquisitions of Suitable Candidates or Integrate Acquisitions Successfully.

Our historical growth has included, and our future growth is likely to continue to include, acquisitions. We intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to us.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses.

The Markets We Serve are Highly Competitive and this Competition Could Reduce our Sales and Operating Margins.

Most of our products are sold in competitive markets. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and



services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.

We are Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and Components Used in Our Products.

While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Significant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm Our Financial Results.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Indian Rupee and Chinese Renminbi. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. Dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.”

An Unfavorable Outcome of Any of Our Pending Contingencies or Litigation Could Adversely Affect Us.

We currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”

Our Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill, are a Significant Portion of Our Total Assets and a Write-off of Our Intangible Assets Would Adversely Impact Our Operating Results and Significantly Reduce Our Net Worth.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At

December 31, 2014

, goodwill and intangible assets totaled

$1,321.3 million

and

$271.2 million

, respectively. These assets result from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired. Annually, or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels, we could be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth. See Note 4 in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.

Item 2.

Properties.

The Company’s principal plants and offices have an aggregate floor space area of approximately 4.2 million square feet, of which 2.7 million square feet (65%) is located in the U.S. and approximately 1.5 million square feet (35%) is located outside the U.S., primarily in the U.K. (9%), Germany (8%), China (4%), India (2%) and The Netherlands (2%). Management considers these facilities suitable and adequate for the Company's operations. Management believes the Company can meet demand increases over the near term with its existing facilities, especially given its operational improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity. The Company’s executive office occupies 36,588 square feet of leased space in Lake Forest, Illinois and 4,420 square feet of leased space in Chicago, Illinois.

Approximately 2.6 million square feet (63%) of the principal plant and office floor area is owned by the Company, and the balance is held under lease. Approximately 1.7 million square feet (40%) of the principal plant and office floor area is held by business units in the Fluid & Metering Technologies segment; 1.3 million square feet (31%) is held by business units in the



Health & Science Technologies segment; and 1.0 million square feet (23%) is held by business units in the Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company and six of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries and seeking money damages, allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos. These components were acquired from third party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of the subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company’s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover its settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance have been settled for various insignificant amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the affected business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company for these asbestos-related claims, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on it.

The Company is also party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on it.

(5)

Set forth below are reconciliations of Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable measures of net income and operating income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  We have reconciled Adjusted operating income to Operating income; Adjusted net income to Net income; Adjusted EPS to EPS; consolidated EBITDA to net income; and segment EBITDA to segment operating income.

Management uses Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted EPS as metrics by which to measure performance of the Company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as asset impairments and restructuring expenses. Management also supplements its U.S. GAAP financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency, and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

EBITDA means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Given the acquisitive nature of the Company which results in a higher level of amortization expense at recently acquired businesses, management uses EBITDA as an internal operating metric to provide management with another representation of performance of businesses across our three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes. EBITDA is also used to calculate certain financial covenants, as discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, EBITDA has been adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as asset impairments and restructuring expenses to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a performance indicator on ongoing operations. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to some investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company's and its segments ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may differ from that used by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

fire and rescue industry, and engineered stainless steel banding and clamping devices used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications, precision equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing colorants and paints used in a variety of retail and commercial businesses around the world.

Our


financial results are as follows:

•

Sales of

$2.1 billion

increased

6%

; organic sales — excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation — were up 5%.

Our


financial results, adjusted for

$13.7 million

of restructuring costs, are as follows (These non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to U.S. GAAP measures in Item 6, "Selected Financial Data"):

•

Adjusted operating income of

$444.9 million

increased

12%

and adjusted operating margin of

20.7%

was

up


basis points from the prior year.

•

Adjusted net income of

higher than the prior year of

$255.2 million

.

•

Adjusted EPS of

$3.57

Overall, we believe we are operating in a challenging market environment, which will continue throughout 2015. On a regional basis, we anticipate North American demand will be solid, the European market will remain soft throughout 2015, and Asia will be volatile. For


, based on the Company’s current outlook, we anticipate 1 to 2 percent organic revenue growth and EPS of $3.65 to $3.75.

Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


. For purposes of this Item, reference is made to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses.  Management's primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income, and operating margin.

In the following discussion, and throughout this report, references to organic sales, a non-GAAP measure, refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States but excludes (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales from acquired businesses during the first twelve months of ownership. The portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.

Performance in


Compared with


Sales in


were

$2.1 billion

, a

6%

increase

from the comparable period last year. This increase reflects a 5% increase in organic sales and 1% from acquisitions (Aegis — April 2014 and FTL — March 2013).  Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 50% of total sales in 2014 compared with 51% in


.



In


, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed

42%

of sales and

43%

of operating income; Health & Science Technologies contributed

35%

of sales and

31%

of operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products contributed

23%

of sales and

26%

of operating income.

Gross profit of

$949.3 million

in


increased

$76.0 million

, or

9%

, from


, while gross margins were

44.2

% in


and

43.1%

in


. The increases are mainly attributable to increased sales volume, favorable net material costs as well as benefits from productivity initiatives.

SG&A expenses

increased

to

$504.4 million

in


from

$477.9 million

in


. The

$26.6 million

increase

reflects approximately $4.0 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions and $22.6 million of volume-related expenses.  As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were

23.5%

for


and

23.6%

for


.

During 2014, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $13.7 million. No restructuring expenses were recorded in 2013. The 2014 restructuring expenses were mainly attributable to employee severance related to head count reductions across all three segments and corporate.

Operating income of

$431.2 million

in


increased

from the

$395.5 million

recorded in


, primarily reflecting an increase in volume, improved productivity partially offset by the $13.7 million of restructuring-related charges recorded in 2014. Operating margin of

20.1%

in


was

up

from

19.5%

in


primarily due to volume leverage and productivity partially offset by the restructuring-related charges in 2014.

Other (income) expense

increased

$3.3 million

from other

expense

of

$0.2 million

in


to

$3.1 million

of

income

in


mainly due to a favorable impact from foreign currency transactions and an increase in interest income.

Interest expense

decreased

slightly to

$41.9 million

in


from

$42.2 million

in


. The

decrease

was principally due to lower interest rates.

The provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes

increased

to

$113.1 million

in


compared to

$97.9 million

in


. The effective tax rate

increased

to

28.8%

in


compared to

27.7%

in


, due to a mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions and  the 2012 U.S. R&D credit in 2013, which was retroactively reinstated to January 1, 2012 as a result of the the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 on January 2, 2013.

Net income for the year of

$279.4 million

increased

from the

$255.2 million

earned in


. Diluted earnings per share in


of

$3.45

increased

$0.36

from

$3.09

in


due to higher net income and lower share count resulting from share repurchases.

Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment

Sales of

$899.6 million

increased

$27.8 million

, or

3%

, in


compared with


. This increase reflected 2% organic growth and 1% acquisition. The increase in organic sales was attributable to growth across all our platforms and groups within the segment. In


, organic sales increased approximately 4% domestically and 1% internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 45% of total segment sales in


, compared with 46% in


.

Sales within our Energy platform increased modestly compared to 2013, due to the strength of the LPG and refined fuel markets. Sales have grown in the North American and Asian markets, while Europe and the Middle East sales have declined, due to the fall in oil prices and large project delays. Sales within our CFP platform increased compared to 2013 on

continued strength of the North American industrial distribution and chemical markets. This increase was partially offset by a decline in CFP chemical sales in Europe due to a lack of project activity. Sales within our Agriculture group increased slightly driven by strong aftermarket demand in North America, which was offset by weak OEM demand due to falling farm income. The sales increase in WST was driven by share gains from new products and increased global project activity. DDPT saw modest sales growth due to softness in the Asian and European markets, offset by a pickup in the Middle East and the semiconductor markets.



Operating income of

$216.9 million

was higher than the

$211.3 million

recorded in 2013, while operating margin of

24.1%

was lower than the

24.2%

recorded in


, primarily due to $6.4 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2014, partially offset by volume leverage and productivity initiatives.

Health & Science Technologies Segment

Sales of

$752.0 million

increased

$37.4 million

, or

5%

, in


compared with


. This

increase

reflected 4% growth in organic sales and 1% favorable foreign currency translation. In


, organic sales increased 7% domestically and 1% internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 54% of total segment sales in


compared with 53% in


.

Sales within our MPT platform increased compared to 2013 due to large projects in the Asian food and pharmaceutical markets. Sales within our Scientific Fluidics platform increased after pausing in the middle part of 2014 as customers right-sized their inventory. In the latter part of 2014 we saw increased demand from the core biotech, in-vitro diagnostic and analytical instrumentation markets. Sales within our Sealing Solutions group increased compared to 2013 due to strong growth  in the semiconductor and marine diesel markets, partially offset by softness in oil & gas towards year end due to declining oil prices. Sales within our IOP platform were flat when compared to 2013, primarily from continued slow demand in the industrial and life sciences markets. Sales in our Industrial group increased compared to 2013 due strong growth in the North American distribution markets, and the success of new product introductions.

Operating income and operating margin of

$153.0 million

and

20.3%

, respectively, in


were

up

from

$136.7 million

and

19.1%

, respectively, recorded in


, primarily due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives, partially offset by $4.9 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2014.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products Segment

Sales of

$502.7 million

increased

$57.7 million

, or

13%

, in


compared with


. This

increase

was driven entirely by organic growth. In


, organic sales increased 17% domestically and 9% internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 54% of total segment sales in


, compared with 56% in


.

Sales within our Dispensing group increased due to the fulfillment of a large order in the first quarter of 2014 and the strength of Asian and Western European markets. The sales increase within our Band-It group was driven by continued strength in the transportation, cable management and industrial industries, offset by declines in oil and gas application markets to close out the year. Sales within our Fire Suppression group increased as a result of orders for fire suppression trailers at power production facilities and stable project orders in China and North America. Sales within our Rescue group decreased slightly, due to delayed decision making for municipal projects in Europe and Asia.

Operating income and operating margin of

$130.5 million

and

26.0%

, respectively, were

higher

than the

$102.7 million

and

23.1%

recorded in


, primarily due to volume leverage, partially offset by $1.0 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2014.



Performance in


Compared with


Sales in 2013 were $2.0 billion, a 4% increase from 2012. This increase reflects a 2% increase in organic sales and 2% from acquisitions (ERC — April 2012, Matcon — July 2012 and FTL —March 2013).  Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 51% of total sales in the period compared with 50% in 2012.

In 2013, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 43% of sales and 47% of operating income; Health & Science Technologies contributed 35% of sales and 30% of operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products contributed 22% of sales and 23% of operating income.

Gross profit of $873.4 million in 2013 increased $69.7 million, or 8.7%, from 2012. Gross margins were 43.1% in 2013 and 41.1% in 2012.

SG&A expenses increased to $477.9 million in 2013 from $444.5 million in 2012. The $33.4 million increase reflects approximately $10.4 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions, $5.6 million of cost-out actions, a $1.7 million pension settlement, $1.2 million related to environmental reserve costs, and $18.6 million of volume-related expenses, partially offset by a $4.0 million gain on the settlement of the contingent consideration related to the Matcon business acquired in July 2012.  As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 23.6% for 2013 and 22.7% for 2012.

During 2012, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $32.5 million. These restructuring expenses were mainly attributable to employee severance related to employee reductions across various functional areas, the termination of a defined benefit pension plan and facility rationalization resulting from the Company’s cost savings initiatives. These initiatives included exit costs related to five facility closures and severance benefits for 491 employees in 2012.

Operating income of $395.5 million in 2013 increased from the $128.2 million recorded in 2012, primarily reflecting an increase in volume, improved productivity and the impact of the $198.5 million asset impairment charges and the $32.5 million of restructuring-related charges recorded in 2012. Operating margin of 19.5% in 2013 was up from 6.6% in 2012 primarily due to volume leverage, productivity and the impact of asset impairment charges and restructuring-related charges in 2012.

Interest expense decreased slightly to $42.2 million in 2013 from $42.3 million in 2012. The decrease was principally due to lower debt levels.

The provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes increased to $97.9 million in 2013 compared to $48.6 million in 2012. The effective tax rate decreased to 27.7% in 2013 compared to 56.3% in 2012, mainly due to the 2012 asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impairment charge increased our 2012 effective tax rate by 26.9%. Our effective tax rate was also impacted by recognition of the 2012 U.S. R&D credit in 2013 due to the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 on January 2, 2013 which reinstated the U.S. R&D Credit retroactively to January 1, 2012, recognition of additional UK R&D tax benefits, revaluation of the UK deferred tax liability due to the reduction in the UK statutory tax rate, the settlement of the contingent consideration agreement related to the Matcon business acquired in July 2012, and the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.

Net income for the year of $255.2 million increased from the $37.6 million earned in 2012. Diluted earnings per share in 2013 of $3.09 increased $2.64 from $0.45 in 2012.

Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment



Sales of $871.8 million increased $38.5 million, or 5%, in 2013 compared with 2012. This increase reflected 4% organic growth and 1% favorable foreign currency translation. The increase in organic sales was attributable to growth across all our platforms and groups within the segment. In 2013, organic sales increased approximately 3% domestically and 6% internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 46% of total segment sales in 2013, compared with 47% in 2012.

Sales within our Energy platform increased compared to 2012, due to the strength of OEM truck builds and electronic retrofits in North America. Additional growth has been driven by growth across the LPG market, including North America, China, India and Russia. Sales within our CFP platform increased compared to 2012 on

continued strength in the chemical markets, particularly with project opportunities in the Middle East and Asia, coupled with solid aftermarket performance. The CFP North American industrial distribution market started the year soft, but gradually recovered in the second half of 2013. Sales increases within our Agriculture group were driven by strong OEM demand in North America, new product introductions and an increase in market share. The sales increase in WST was driven by share gains and strong global project activity, specifically for projects in the US and Japan. DDPT saw only modest sales growth due to softness in several core markets, but this was offset by a pickup in the Middle East and the semiconductor markets.

Operating income and operating margin of $211.3 million and 24.2%, respectively, were higher than the $146.7 million and 17.6% recorded in 2012, primarily due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of the $27.7 million of impairment charges and $6.3 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2012.

Health & Science Technologies Segment

Sales of $714.7 million increased $19.4 million, or 3%, in 2013 compared with 2012. This increase reflected 6% growth from acquisitions (ERC, Matcon and FTL), offset by a 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 2% decrease in organic sales.  In 2013, organic sales decreased 1% domestically and 3% internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 53% of total segment sales in 2013 compared with 51% in 2012.

Sales within our MPT platform increased compared to 2012 due to large projects in the pharmaceutical and chemical markets, driven by released capital spending, particularly in North America and Europe. Sales within our Scientific Fluidics platform increased on the success of new products introduced throughout 2013 and share gains. In the latter part of 2013, Scientific Fluidics benefited from the the easing of National Institute of Health funding constraints, which opened up further spending in our core Analytical Instruments and In Vitro Diagnostic markets. Sales within our Specialty Seals group increased compared to 2012 due to a full nine months of sales from FTL, acquired in March 2013, continued strong growth in oil & gas, and stability in the scientific and commercial aircraft end markets. Sales within our IOP platform decreased compared to 2012, primarily from continued weak demand in the defense, biotechnology and electronics end markets as well as the decision to exit certain product lines. Sales in our Industrial group decreased compared to 2012 due to several original equipment manufacturer orders that did not repeat in 2013.

Operating income and operating margin of $136.7 million and 19.1%, respectively, in 2013 were up from the operating loss and negative operating margin of $62.8 million and 9.0%, respectively, recorded in 2012, primarily due to volume leverage and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of the $170.8 million of impairment charges and the $14.7 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2012.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products Segment

Sales of $445.0 million increased $8.0 million, or 2%, in 2013 compared with 2012. This increase reflected 1% organic growth and 1% favorable foreign currency translation. In 2013, organic sales increased 1% domestically and 2%



internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 56% of total segment sales in 2013, compared with 57% in 2012.

Sales within our Dispensing group decreased due to the fulfillment of a large replenishment order in the first half of 2012. However, excluding this order, sales increased on strength in our core North American markets, driven by low volatile organic compound programs, and expanded sales from our low-end automatic dispenser, X-Smart, in EMEA and Asia. The sales increase within our Band-It group was driven by general strength in the oil and gas applications market and large automotive blanket orders for new vehicle platforms in North America. Sales within our Fire Suppression group increased as a result of orders for fire suppression trailers at power production facilities, project orders in China, and a stable core business in North America and Western Europe. Sales within our Rescue group increased as a result of robust demand for our rescue tools within the North American and European markets.

Operating income and operating margin of $102.7 million and 23.1%, respectively, were higher than the $96.1 million and 22.0% recorded in 2012, primarily due to the impact of the $8.3 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2012, as well as volume leverage, partially offset by mix across businesses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities

decreased

$33.6 million

, or

8.4%

, to

$368.0 million

in


, primarily due to higher investments in working capital, partially offset by an increase in net income and accrued expenses. At

December 31, 2014

, working capital was

$663.8 million

and the Company’s current ratio was

2.61 to 1

. At

December 31, 2014

, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled

$509.1 million

, of which

$403.5 million

was held outside of the United States.

Investing Activities

Cash flow used in investing activities increased

$4.1 million

, or

6.0%

to

$72.3 million

in


, primarily as a result of higher capital expenditures, partially offset by lower cash paid for acquisitions.

Cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of

$48.0 million

and

$31.5 million

in


and


, respectively. Capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that improved productivity, although a portion was for business system technology, replacement of equipment, and construction of  new facilities. Management believes that the Company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term.

The Company acquired Aegis Flow Technologies ("Aegis") in April 2014 for cash consideration of $25.4 million, and FTL Seals Technology, Ltd ("FTL") in March 2013 for cash consideration of $34.5 million (£23.1 million). The entire purchase price for both acquisitions was funded with borrowings under the Company's bank credit facility.

Financing Activities

Cash flow used in financing activities

decreased

$35.0 million

, or

16.0%

to

$184.1 million

in


, primarily as a result of increased borrowings, net of payments, of $119.4 million under our credit facility, partially offset by an increase of $12.8 million of dividends paid, $18.1 million of lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and an increase of $52.4 million in purchases of common stock.

The Company maintains a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which is a $700.0 million unsecured, multi-currency bank credit facility expiring on June 27, 2016. At

December 31, 2014

,

$115.0 million

was outstanding under the Revolving Facility, with

$7.4 million

of outstanding letters of credit. The net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

December 31, 2014

, was approximately

$577.6 million

. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. This applicable margin is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from .875% to 1.70%. Based on the Company’s credit rating at

December 31, 2014

, the applicable margin was 1.05%. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. An annual Revolving Facility fee, also based on the Company’s credit rating, is currently 20 basis points and is payable quarterly.

On June 9, 2010, the Company completed a private placement of €81.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.58% Series 2010 Senior Euro Notes due June 9, 2015 (“2.58% Senior Euro Notes”) pursuant to a Master Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 9, 2010 (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance of additional series of notes in the future, provided that the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the agreement at any time does not exceed $750.0 million. The 2.58% Senior Euro Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.58% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 9th and December 9th and will mature on June 9, 2015. The 2.58% Senior Euro Notes are unsecured



obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other senior debt. The Company may at any time prepay all or any portion of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes; provided that any such portion is greater than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding under the Purchase Agreement. In the event of a prepayment, the Company would be required to pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium. The Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, create liens and engage in certain mergers or consolidations. In addition, the Company must comply with a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding 2.58% Senior Euro Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment events of defaults, any holder of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes affected thereby may declare all the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes may declare all the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes to be due and payable immediately.

As of December 31, 2014, the Company included the outstanding balance of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes, $98.5 million, within Current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the maturity date is within twelve months and the Company expects to repay the principal balance using cash on the balance sheet.

On December 6, 2010, the Company completed a public offering of $300.0 million 4.5% senior notes due December 15, 2020 (“4.5% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $295.7 million, after deducting a $1.6 million issuance discount, a $1.9 million underwriting commission and $0.8 million offering expenses, were used to repay $250.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. The 4.5% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the 4.5% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Note Indenture governing the 4.5% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and 4.5% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.5% Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.5% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

On December 9, 2011, the Company completed a public offering of $350.0 million 4.2% senior notes due December 15, 2021 (“4.2% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering of approximately $346.2 million, after deducting a $0.9 million issuance discount, a $2.3 million underwriting commission and $0.6 million offering expenses, were used to repay $306.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. The 4.2% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.2% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The Company may redeem all or part of the 4.2% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Note Indenture governing the 4.2% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and 4.2% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.2% Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.2% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes. The most restrictive financial covenants under these debt instruments require a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1. At

December 31, 2014

, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company’s interest coverage ratio was

12.72

to 1 and the leverage ratio was

1.69

to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 4.5% Senior Notes or 4.2% Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions.

On

November 6, 2014

the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase of

$400.0 million

in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation. During


, the Company purchased a total of

3.0 million

shares at a cost of

$222.5 million

, of which $2.6 million was settled in January 2015, compared to 2.9 million shares purchased at a cost of $167.5 million in


. As of

December 31, 2014

, there was

$545 million

of repurchase authorization remaining.

The Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock for the next twelve months. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are



available for acquisition on acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. As of

December 31, 2014

,

$115.0 million

was outstanding under the Revolving Facility, with

$7.4 million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

December 31, 2014

of approximately

$577.6 million

.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary course of business. There are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of our credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at

December 31, 2014

, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional detail regarding these obligations is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(1)

Includes interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates for variable debt.

(2)

Consists primarily of tangible personal property leases.

(3)

Consists primarily of inventory commitments.

(4)

Comprises liabilities recorded on the balance sheet of $956.3 million, and obligations not recorded on the balance sheet of $346.1 million.

Critical Accounting Policies

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Revenue recognition

— The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including the combination of products and services. In such cases, the Company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with ASC 605-25 “Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements-Recognition” and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method. Revenues from some long-term contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also



offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets

— The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations. An indefinite lived intangible asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of goodwill, long-lived or intangible assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally, testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances is performed annually. The amount and timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets.

The Company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in ASC 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. Annually, on October 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the fair value of their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists.

The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology weighted 50%. To determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the Company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations.

The key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market methodology used to determine fair value. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the weighted average cost of capital, the market multiples and terminal growth rates. The


and


ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the Company are as follows:

In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considered both the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on comparing the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long term growth rate and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.

In


and


, there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date. Based on the results of our measurement as of October 31,


, all reporting units had a fair value that was greater than 100% in excess of carrying value, except for our IOP reporting unit, which had a fair value that was greater than 15% in excess of carrying value.

The unamortized Banjo trade name was determined to be an indefinite lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

In


and


, there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date. Based on the results of our measurement as of October 31,


, the fair value of the Banjo trade name was greater than 40% in excess of carrying value.



A long-lived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. The amount and

timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets. In


and


, the Company concluded that certain long lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets, resulting in $2.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of impairment charges.

Defined benefit retirement plans —

The plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets. Plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the Company. Key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and the estimated future return on plan assets. To the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts, results could be adversely affected.

The Society of Actuaries recently released revised mortality tables, which update life expectancy assumptions. In consideration of these tables, we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2014

, which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years. The new mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans. These expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the (gain) loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which in turn, may impact the Company’s funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. Each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the PBO of approximately $27 million based upon the

December 31, 2014

data.  Each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the PBO of approximately $33 million based upon the

December 31, 2014

data.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09 which introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Under the policy, the Company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes, and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt.

The Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Chinese Renminbi. The Company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of products. The foreign currency transaction losses for the period ending

December 31, 2014

,


and


were

$0.9 million

,

$2.2 million

, and

$2.3 million

, respectively, and are reported within Other (income) expense-net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.



The Company’s interest rate exposure is primarily related to its

$864.0 million

of total debt outstanding at

December 31, 2014

. Approximately 13% of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market. A 50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximate $0.6 million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows. The remaining debt is fixed rate debt.

IDEX's products are sold in niche markets to a wide range of industries throughout the world. The Company’s products include industrial pumps, compressors, flow meters, injectors and valves, and related controls for use in a wide variety of process applications; precision fluidics solutions, including pumps, valves, degassing equipment, corrective tubing, fittings, and complex manifolds, precision photonic solutions, optical filters and specialty medical equipment and devices used in life science applications; precision-engineered equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing paints; refinishing equipment; and engineered products for industrial and commercial markets, including fire and rescue, transportation equipment, oil and gas, electronics, and communications. These activities are grouped into

three

reportable segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, recoverability of long-lived assets, income taxes, product warranties, contingencies and litigation, insurance-related items,  defined benefit retirement plans and purchase accounting related to acquisitions.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including the combination of products and services. In such cases the Company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with ASC 605-25 and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method. Revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and are recognized as a period expense during the period in which they are incurred.



Advertising Costs

Advertising costs of

$14.5 million

,

$14.6 million

and

$15.3 million

for


,


and


, respectively, are expensed as incurred within Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of

90 days or less

to be cash and cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customer’s inability to make required payments. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivables that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost, which includes material, labor, and factory overhead, is determined on a FIFO basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, at the business unit level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering changes.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, as measured by comparing their net book value to the projected undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.

A long-lived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. The amount and

timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of the related assets. In


, 2013 and 2012, the Company concluded that certain long lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets, resulting in

$2.5 million

,

$2.7 million

and

$7.0 million

, respectively, of long-lived asset impairment charges.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually on October 31, or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these assets based on the estimated fair value of each of the fifteen reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible asset. See Note 4 for a further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.

Borrowing Expenses

Expenses incurred in securing and issuing debt are capitalized and included in Other noncurrent assets. These assets are amortized over the life of the related borrowing and the related amortization is included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents (diluted) outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options, which have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, unvested shares, performance share units, and shares issuable in connection with certain deferred compensation agreements ("DCUs").

ASC 260 concludes that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable



dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. If awards are considered participating securities, the Company is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its outstanding unvested shares are participating securities. Accordingly, earnings per common share were computed using the two-class method prescribed by ASC 260. Net income attributable to common shareholders was reduced by

$1.3 million

,

$1.2 million

and

$0.1 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Basic weighted average shares outstanding reconciles to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows:

Options to purchase approximately

0.5 million

,

zero

and

1.2 million

shares of common stock in


,


and


, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based compensation plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 13 for further discussion on share-based compensation.

Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Certain identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives used in the computation of amortization of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:

Research and Development Expenditures

Costs associated with research and development are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Cost of sales within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development expenses, which include costs associated with developing new products and major improvements to existing products, were

$36.8 million

,

$33.0 million

and

$36.4 million

in


,


and


, respectively.



Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of substantially all operations outside the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly, those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. The gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The foreign currency transaction losses for the period ending

December 31, 2014

,


and


were

$0.9 million

,

$2.2 million

, and

$2.3 million

, respectively, and are reported within Other (income) expense-net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes United States, state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is not dependent on a single customer, the largest of which accounted for less than

2%

of net sales for all years presented.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09 which introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model. Under ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2017.

2.    Acquisitions

Includes provision for doubtful accounts, sales returns and sales discounts granted to customers.

4.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for


and


, by business segment, were as follows:

ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives were tested for impairment as of October 31,


, the Company's annual impairment date. In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on comparing the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rate and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.

There were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date, in


or


. Based on the results of our measurement at October 31,


, all reporting units had a fair value that was greater than 100% in excess of carrying value, except for our IOP reporting unit, which had a fair value that was greater than

15%

in excess of carrying value.



The following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset at

and


:

The unamortized Banjo trade name was determined to be an indefinite lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent of a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

In

5.    Borrowings

Borrowings at

December 31, 2014

and


consisted of the following:

On June 27, 2011 the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), as borrowers with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, and other



lenders party thereto which provided for a new revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). The Revolving Facility replaced the Company’s previous

$600.0 million

credit facility, which expired in December 2011.

The Revolving Facility is in an aggregate principal amount of

$700.0 million

with a maturity date of

June 27, 2016

. Up to

$75.0 million

of the Revolving Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to

$25.0 million

of the Revolving Facility is available to the Company for swing line loans, available on a same-day basis.

Proceeds of the Revolving Facility are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments may not exceed

$950.0 million

. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, Fast & Fluid Management Europe B.V., (“FME”) and IDEX UK Ltd. (“IDEX UK”) were approved by the lenders as designated borrowers. At

December 31, 2014

, FME and IDEX UK had no borrowings under the Revolving Facility.

Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from

.875%

to

1.70%

. Based on the Company’s credit rating at

December 31, 2014

, the applicable margin was

1.05%

. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. An annual Revolving Facility fee, also based on the Company’s credit rating, is currently


basis points and is payable quarterly.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company believes are usual and customary for senior unsecured credit agreements, including a financial covenant requiring a maximum leverage ratio of a

3.25

to

1.0

, which is the ratio of the Company’s consolidated total debt to its consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate) including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the representations or warranties in any material respect; breach of the financial, affirmative or negative covenants; payment default on, or acceleration of, other material indebtedness; bankruptcy or insolvency; material judgments entered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries; certain specified events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain changes in control of the Company; and the invalidity or unenforceability of the Credit Agreement or other documents associated with the Credit Agreement.

At

December 31, 2014

,

$115.0 million

was outstanding under the Revolving Facility, with

$7.4 million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

December 31, 2014

of approximately

$577.6 million

.

On June 9, 2010 the Company completed a private placement of

€81.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

2.58%

Series 2010 Senior Euro Notes due

June 9, 2015

(“

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes”) pursuant to a Master Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 9, 2010 (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance of additional series of notes in the future, provided that the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the agreement at any time does not exceed

$750.0 million

. The

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes bear interest at a rate of

2.58%

per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 9th and December 9th and will mature on

June 9, 2015

. The

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other senior debt. The Company may at any time prepay all or any portion of the

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes; provided that any such portion is greater than

5%

of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding under the Purchase Agreement. In the event of a prepayment, the Company would be required to pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole premium. The Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, create liens and engage in certain mergers or consolidations. In addition, the Company must comply with a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all outstanding

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment events of defaults, any holder of the

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes affected thereby may declare all the

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes may declare all the

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes to be due and payable immediately.

4.5%

Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of the

4.5%

Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the

4.5%

The terms of the

4.2%

Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the

4.2%

Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to

101%

December 31, 2014

consisted primarily of debt at international locations maintained for working capital purposes. Interest is payable on the outstanding debt balances at the international locations at rates ranging from

0.2%

to

1.3%

per annum.

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes. The most restrictive financial covenants under these debt instruments require a minimum interest coverage ratio of

3.0

to


and a maximum leverage ratio of

3.25

Total borrowings at

December 31, 2014

have scheduled maturities as follows:

6.    Derivative Instruments

The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The type of cash flow hedges the Company enters into includes foreign currency contracts and interest rate exchange



agreements that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and are designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.

The effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate exchange agreements is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is recognized into net income during the period of change.

Fair values relating to derivative financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to sell or buy the contracts based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts at each balance sheet date.

On April 15, 2010 the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate contract with a notional amount of

$300.0 million

with a settlement date in December 2010. This contract was entered into in anticipation of the issuance of the

4.5%

$31.0 million

. The

$31.0 million

is being amortized into interest expense over the


year term of the

4.5%

Senior Notes, which results in an effective interest rate of

5.8%

.

7.    Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

•

Level 1:    Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:    Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.



•

Level 3:    Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

The following table summarizes the basis used to measure the Company’s financial assets (liabilities) at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheet at

December 31, 2014

and


:

There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in


or


.

The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments. At

December 31, 2014

, the fair value of our Revolving Facility,

2.58%

Senior Euro Notes,

4.5%

Senior Notes and

4.2%

Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices and current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity, was approximately

$898.7 million

compared to the carrying value of

$861.8 million

. This fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since it is determined based upon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions to entities with a credit rating similar to ours.

8.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases certain office facilities, warehouses and data processing equipment under operating leases. Rental expense totaled

$19.2 million

,

$18.9 million

and

and


were:

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income. The computed amount and the differences for


,


and


are shown in the following table:

The Company has

$683 million

and

$597 million

of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31,


and


, respectively. No deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on these earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so. If these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with the hypothetical calculation, and the amount of liability, if any, is dependent on



circumstances if and when remittance occurs. During the years ended December 31,


and


, the Company repatriated

$6.5 million

and

$11.7 million

of foreign earnings, respectively, resulting in

$0.2 million

of incremental tax benefit and

$0.9 million

of incremental income tax expense, respectively. The Company did not repatriate any foreign earnings during the year ended December 31, 2012. These repatriations in 2013 and 2014 represent distribution

s

of current year earnings and distributions from liquidating subsidiaries and do not impact our representation that the undistributed earnings are permanently invested.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for


,


and


is shown in the following table:

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of

December 31, 2014

,


and


, we had approximately

$0.7 million

,

$0.5 million

and

$0.7 million

, respectively, of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. As of

December 31, 2014

,


and


, we had approximately

$0.3 million

,

$0.2 million

and

$0.5 million

, respectively, of accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized is

$2.9 million

,

$4.5 million

and

$5.8 million

as of

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. The tax years 2008-2013 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by a range of

zero

to

$2.1 million

.

The Company had net operating loss carry forwards related to prior acquisitions for U.S. federal purposes at

December 31, 2014

and


of

$7.1

and

$9.4 million

, respectively. For non-U.S. purposes the Company had net operating loss carry forwards at

December 31, 2014

and


of

$5.0

and

$7.0 million

, respectively. The federal net operating loss carry forwards are available for use against the Company’s consolidated federal taxable income and expire between

2018 and 2031

. The entire balance of the non-U.S. net operating losses is available to be carried forward, with

$1.9 million

of these losses beginning to expire during the year 2021. The remaining

$2.2 million

of such losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

At both

the Company had state net operating loss and credit carry forwards of approximately

$23.7 million

and

$22.4 million

and


is shown below. Net sales were attributed to geographic areas based on location of the customer and no country outside the U.S. was greater than 10% of total revenues.



12.    Restructuring

During 2014 and


the Company recorded restructuring costs as a part of restructuring initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable, growth through cost reduction actions, primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization. The costs incurred related to these initiatives are included in Restructuring expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations while the related accruals are included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, COBRA subsidies, outplacement services, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of asset disposals or impairments and lease exit costs.

2014 Initiative

During 2014 the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter totaling

$13.7 million

related to the 2014 restructuring initiative. These expenses consisted of employee severance related to employee reductions across various functional areas as well as exit costs and asset impairments. The 2014 restructuring initiative included severance benefits for


employees. Severance payments are expected to be fully paid by the end of 2015 using cash from operations.

Pre-tax restructuring expenses by segment for 2014 were as follows:

2011 Initiative

During


the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling

$32.5 million

related to the 2011 restructuring initiative. These expenses consisted of exit costs and employee severance related to employee reductions across various functional areas as well as facility rationalization. The 2011 restructuring initiative included severance benefits for


employees in 2012. The 2011 initiative was completed by the end of 2012 and severance payments were fully paid in 2013 using cash from operations.

Pre-tax restructuring expenses by segment, for


, were as follows:



Restructuring accruals of

$6.1 million

and

zero

at December 31,


and


, respectively, are reflected in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

13.    Share-Based Compensation

The Company maintains

two

share-based compensation plans for executives, non-employee directors and certain key employees that authorize the granting of stock options, unvested shares, unvested share units, and other types of awards consistent with the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s plans as of

December 31, 2014

totals

10.6 million

, of which

2.3 million

shares were available for future issuance. Stock options granted under these plans are generally non-qualified and are granted

with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. The majority of the options issued to employees become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning one year from the date of grant, and generally expire

10 years

from the date of grant. Stock options granted to non-employee directors cliff vest after

one year

. Unvested share and unvested share unit awards generally cliff vest after

three years

for employees and non-employee directors. The Company issued

0.1

million,

0.2

million and

0.2

million of unvested shares as compensation to key employees in


,


and


, respectively.

All unvested shares carry dividend and voting rights and the sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.

Beginning in 2013 the Company granted performance share units to selected key employees that may be earned based on IDEX total shareholder return over the three-year period following the date of grant. Performance share units (referred to as “TSR awards”) are expected to be made annually and are paid out at the end of a

three

-year period based on the Company’s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of IDEX common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of the S&P Midcap 400 Industrial Group for the three-year period following the date of grant. The payment of awards following the three-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from


percent to


percent of the initial grant. A target payout of


percent is earned if total shareholder return is equal to the 50

th

percentile of the S&P Midcap 400 Industrial Group. Performance share units earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of performance share units that are earned. Payments made at the end of the award period will be in the form of stock for performance share units and will be in cash for dividend equivalents. The Company granted approximately

0.1 million

performance share units in both 2014 and 2013.

The Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants.

Weighted average option fair values and assumptions for the period specified are disclosed in the following table:



The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the contractual term of the option.

•

The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life of the option. The expected life assumption for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


is an output of the Binomial lattice option-pricing model, which incorporates vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option to define expected employee behavior.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option. For the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, we present the range of risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice option-pricing model.

•

The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the option.

The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, assuming forfeitures, over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Weighted average performance share unit fair values and assumptions for the period specified are disclosed in the following table:

The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the remaining performance period as of the grant date.

•

Since Monte Carlo valuation is an open form model that uses an expected life commensurate with the performance period, the expected life of the performance share units was assumed to be the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term commensurate with the remaining performance period.

•

Total Shareholder Return is determined assuming that dividends are reinvested in the issuing entity over the performance period, which is mathematically equivalent to utilizing a 0% dividend yield.

Total compensation cost for stock options is as follows:



Total compensation cost for unvested shares is as follows:

Total compensation cost for performance share units is as follows:

Recognition of compensation cost was consistent with recognition of cash compensation for the same employees.

As of

December 31, 2014

there was

$9.9 million

,

$9.4 million

and

$5.4 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, time based shares and performance shares, respectively, that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.4 years

,

1.0 year

and

1.0 year

, respectively.

$4.1 million

,

$3.6 million

and

$2.3 million

in


,


and


, respectively. At

December 31, 2014

14. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of Other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:



Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income are summarized as follows:

15.    Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement plans for its employees. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans. The Company employs the measurement date provisions of ASC 715, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits”, which require the measurement date of plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor’s year end.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets over the two-year period ended

December 31, 2014

, and a statement of the funded status at December 31 for both years.



The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all defined benefit pension plans was

$163.3 million

and

$143.5 million

at

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively.

The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligation at

December 31, 2014

and


were as follows:



The pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of

December 31, 2014

and


were as follows:

The amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of

December 31, 2014

, that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during


are as follows:

The following tables provide the components of, and the weighted average assumptions used to determine, the net periodic benefit cost for the plans in


,


and


:



The following table provides the pretax change recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in


:

The discount rates for our plans are derived by matching the plan’s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same present value of cash flows.

In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the plan’s target asset allocation and current market conditions.

Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries ("SOA") issued updated mortality tables (RP-2014) and a mortality improvement scale (MP-2014), which reflects longer life expectancies than previously projected. In consideration of this information, we studied our historical mortality experience and developed an expectation for continued future mortality improvements. Based on this data and the RP-2014 tables, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recognized at

December 31, 2014

, and the amounts estimated for our


expense. Our updated mortality assumptions resulted in an increase of

$4.9 million

in our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2014

.

Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of

10%

of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.

Costs of defined contribution plans were

$9.1 million

,

$8.4 million

and

$7.9 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in certain multi-employer pension plans covering approximately


participants under U.S. collective bargaining agreements. None of these plans are considered individually significant to the Company as contributions to these plans totaled

$1.0 million

,

$1.1 million

, and

$1.0 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

For measurement purposes, a

7.12%

weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for


. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually each year to a rate of

4.50%

for


, and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A

1%

increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by

$0.1 million

and the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by

$1.6 million

. A

1%

decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by

$0.1 million

and the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by

$1.4 million

.



Plan Assets

The Company’s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at

December 31, 2014

and


, by asset category, were as follows:

The following tables summarize the basis used to measure the defined benefit plans’ assets at fair value at

December 31, 2014

and


:



Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors.

Investment Policies and Strategies

The investment objective of the plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn the highest possible total rate of return consistent with the plan's tolerance for risk. The general asset allocation guidelines for

plan

assets are that “equities” will constitute from

40%

to

60%

of the market value of total fund assets with a target of

50%

, and “fixed income” obligations, including cash, will constitute from

40%

to

60%

with a target of

50%

. The term “equities” includes common stock, convertible bonds and convertible stock. The term “fixed income” includes preferred stock and/or contractual payments with a specific maturity date. The Company strives to maintain asset allocations within the designated ranges by conducting periodic reviews of fund allocations and plan liquidity needs, and rebalancing the portfolio accordingly. Diversification of assets is employed to ensure that adverse performance of one security or security class does not have an undue detrimental impact on the portfolio as a whole. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by type, characteristic and number of investments, as well as by investment style of designated investment fund managers. No restrictions are placed on the selection of individual investments by the investment fund managers. The total fund performance and the performance of the investment fund managers is reviewed on a regular basis, using appointed professional independent advisors. As of December 31,


and


, there were no shares of the Company’s stock held in plan assets.

Cash Flows

The Company expects to contribute approximately

$1.6 million

to its defined benefit plans and

$0.5 million

to its other postretirement benefit plans in


. The Company also expects to contribute approximately

$9.1 million

to its defined contribution plan and

$8.0 million

to its 401(k) savings plan in


.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The future estimated benefit payments for the next five years and the five years thereafter are as follows:


—

$9.0 million

;


—

$9.6 million

;


—

$10.1 million

;


—

$10.7 million

;


—

$10.7 million

; 2020 to 2025 —

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, of the Company and our report dated

February 23, 2015

, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.



MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2014

.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.
