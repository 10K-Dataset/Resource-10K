Item 1.

Business.

IDEX Corporation (“IDEX,” the “Company,” “us,” “our,” or “we”) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on September 24, 1987. The Company is an applied solutions business that sells an extensive array of pumps, valves, flow meters and other fluidics systems and components and engineered products to customers in a variety of markets around the world. All of the Company’s business activities are carried out through wholly-owned subsidiaries.

The Company has three reportable business segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies (“FMT”), Health & Science Technologies (“HST”) and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products (“FSDP”). Within our three reportable segments, the Company maintains thirteen platforms, where we focus on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Each of our thirteen platforms is also a reporting unit, where we annually test for goodwill impairment.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reorganized certain of its reporting units to align with changes in management and as a result of certain divestitures as well as to align with how management will run the business going forward as follows:

•

Moved the Richter and Aegis businesses from the previous Industrial reporting unit to the Valves reporting unit;

•

Moved the Trebor business from the previous Industrial reporting unit to the Water reporting unit;

•

Replaced the previous Industrial reporting unit with the Pumps reporting unit, which now includes Viking and Warren Rupp;

•

Combined the Scientific Fluidics and IDEX Optics & Photonics reporting units into the Scientific Fluidics & Optics reporting unit; and

•

Combined the Fire Suppression and Rescue reporting units into the Fire & Safety reporting unit.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

For an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors present risks to the Company and could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant of these factors are as follows:

Changes in U.S. or International Economic Conditions Could Adversely Affect the Sales and Profitability of Our Businesses.

In


,

50%

of the Company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while

50%

were derived from international operations. The Company’s largest end markets include life sciences and medical technologies, fire and rescue, oil & gas, paint and coatings, chemical processing, agriculture, water & wastewater treatment and optical filters and components. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy and, in particular, any of these specific end markets could reduce the Company’s sales and profitability.

Change to Political and Economic Conditions in the U.S. and Foreign Countries in Which We Operate Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

In


, approximately

50%

of our total sales were to customers outside the U.S. We expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks include the following:

•

possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;

•

risks of economic instability;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;

•

disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;

•

withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the United States and other countries;

•

changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements; and

•

political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war.

Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.

Our Inability to Continue to Develop New Products Could Limit Our Sales Growth.

Our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products.

Our Growth Strategy Includes Acquisitions and We May Not be Able to Make Acquisitions of Suitable Candidates or Integrate Acquisitions Successfully.

Our historical growth has included, and our future growth is likely to continue to include, acquisitions. We intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to us.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted in, and future acquisitions could result in, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses.

The Markets We Serve are Highly Competitive and this Competition Could Reduce our Sales and Operating Margins.

Most of our products are sold in competitive markets. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop



products that are superior to our products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.

We are Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and Components Used in Our Products.

While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Significant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm Our Financial Results.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Indian Rupee and Chinese Renminbi. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. Dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.”

Fluctuations in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Position.

Our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. We maintain a revolving credit facility, which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating. A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our cost of borrowings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk."

An Unfavorable Outcome of Any of Our Pending Contingencies or Litigation Could Adversely Affect Us.

We currently are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”

Our Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill, are a Significant Portion of Our Total Assets and a Write-off of Our Intangible Assets or Goodwill Would Adversely Impact Our Operating Results and Significantly Reduce Our Net Worth.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At

December 31, 2016

, goodwill and intangible assets totaled

$1,632.6 million

and

$435.5 million

, respectively. These assets result from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired. Annually, or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels, we could be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth. See Note 4 in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.

A Significant or Sustained Decline in Commodity Prices, Including Oil, Could Negatively Impact the Levels of Expenditures by Certain of Our Customers.

Demand for our products depends, in part, on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers. The level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital



spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries. Reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Success Depends on Our Executive Management and Other Key Personnel.

Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited, and the competition for talent is robust. However, we provide long-term equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a long-term commitment to our Company. Our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan.

Our Business Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Information Systems Interruptions or Intrusion.

We depend on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Failure To Comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or Other Applicable Anti-bribery Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2.

Properties.

The Company’s principal plants and offices have an aggregate floor space area of approximately 4.7 million square feet, of which 2.9 million square feet (62%) is located in the U.S. and approximately 1.8 million square feet (38%) is located outside the U.S., primarily in Germany (9%), U.K. (8%), Italy (6%), China (4%), India (3%), Canada (2%) and The Netherlands (2%). Management considers these facilities suitable and adequate for the Company’s operations. Management believes the Company can meet demand increases over the near term with its existing facilities, especially given its operational improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity. The Company’s executive office occupies 36,588 square feet of leased space in Lake Forest, Illinois and 4,420 square feet of leased space in Chicago, Illinois.



Approximately 3.3 million square feet (70%) of the principal plant and office floor area is owned by the Company, and the balance is held under lease. Approximately 1.7 million square feet (36%) of the principal plant and office floor area is held by business units in the Fluid & Metering Technologies segment; 1.4 million square feet (30%) is held by business units in the Health & Science Technologies segment; and 1.3 million square feet (28%) is held by business units in the Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment. The remaining 0.3 million square feet include the executive office as well as shared services locations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company and six of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries and seeking money damages, allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos. These components were acquired from third party suppliers, and were not manufactured by the Company or any of the defendant subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company’s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover its settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance have been settled for various insignificant amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the affected business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company for these asbestos-related claims, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is also party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

The principal market for the Company’s common stock is the New York Stock Exchange, but the common stock is also listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange. As of

February 14, 2017

, there were approximately

7,030

stockholders of record of our common stock and there were

76,248,604

shares outstanding.

The high and low sales prices of the common stock per share and the dividends paid per share during the last two years are as follows:

Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our earnings and other factors.

For information pertaining to securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans and the related weighted average exercise price, see Part III, Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.”

The Company’s purchases of common stock during the quarter ended

December 31, 2016

are as follows:

(1)

On

December 1, 2015

, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase of

$300.0 million

in the authorized level of repurchases of common stock. This followed the prior Board of Directors approved repurchase authorization of $400.0 million that was announced by the Company on November 6, 2014. These authorizations have no expiration date.



Performance Graph.

The following table compares total stockholder returns over the last five years to the Standard & Poor’s (the “S&P”) 500 Index, the S&P Midcap Industrials Sector Index and the Russell 2000 Index assuming the value of the investment in our common stock and each index was $100 on

December 31, 2011

. Total return values for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, S&P Midcap Industrials Sector Index and the Russell 2000 Index were calculated on cumulative total return values assuming reinvestment of dividends. The stockholder return shown on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-03 regarding simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The update was applied retrospectively to all periods presented in accordance with the provisions of the update. Refer to Note 1 for additional information related to ASU 2015-03 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(5)

Return on average assets is calculated as: Net income / (Current year Total assets + Prior year Total assets) / 2; Borrowings as a percent of capitalization is calculated as: (Long-term borrowings + Short-term borrowings) / (Long-term borrowings + Short-term borrowings + Total shareholders’ equity); Return on average shareholders’ equity is calculated as Net Income / (Current year Total shareholders’ equity + Prior year Total shareholders’ equity) / 2

(6)

Set forth below are reconciliations of Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable measures of net income and operating income, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).  We have reconciled Adjusted operating income to Operating income; Adjusted net income to Net income; Adjusted EPS to EPS; consolidated EBITDA, segment EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment EBITDA to net income. The reconciliation of segment EBITDA to net income was performed on a consolidated basis due to the fact that we do not allocate consolidated interest expense or the consolidated provision for income taxes to our segments.

Management uses Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted EPS as metrics by which to measure performance of the Company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as gains/losses on the sale of businesses, restructuring expenses, and pension settlements. Management also supplements its U.S. GAAP financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency, and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

EBITDA means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Given the acquisitive nature of the Company which results in a higher level of amortization expense from recently acquired businesses, management uses EBITDA as an internal operating metric to provide another representation of the businesses’ performance across our three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes. EBITDA is also used to calculate certain financial covenants, as discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, EBITDA has been adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as gains/losses on the sale of businesses, restructuring expenses, and pension settlements to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a performance indicator of ongoing operations. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to some investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and its segments’ ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may differ from that used by other companies.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Our


financial results were as follows:

•

Sales of

$2.1 billion

increased

5%

, reflecting a

1%

decrease

in organic sales (excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation),  a

1% decrease

due to foreign currency translation, and a

7% increase

due to acquisitions/divestitures.

•

Operating income of

$405.8 million

and operating margin of

19.2%

were

down

6% and


basis points, respectively, from the prior year.

•

Net income

decreased

4%

to

$271.1 million

.

•

Diluted EPS of

$3.53

decreased

$0.09

or

2%

compared to


.

Our


financial results, adjusted for

$3.7 million

of restructuring costs, a $3.6 million pension settlement charge and a $

22.3 million

loss on sale of businesses, compared to our 2015 financial results adjusted for $11.2 million of restructuring costs and an $18.1 million gain on sale of a business are as follows (these non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to U.S. GAAP measures in Item 6, “Selected Financial Data”):

•

Adjusted operating income of

$435.3 million

and adjusted operating margin of

20.6%

were

up

2%

and

down


basis points, respectively, from the prior year.



•

Adjusted net income

increased

4%

to

$288.4 million

.

•

Adjusted EPS of

$3.75

was

6%

higher

than prior year adjusted EPS of

$3.55

.

Overall, we remain cautious due to the uncertainty within the global economy and the global political environment and project 1 to 2 percent organic growth in 2017. We expect to deliver full year 2017 EPS of $3.87 to $3.95.

Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


. For purposes of this Item, reference is made to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses. Management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income, and operating margin.

In the following discussion, and throughout this report, references to organic sales, a non-GAAP measure, refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States but excludes (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because the nature, size, and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.

Performance in


Compared with


Sales in


were

$2.1 billion

, a

5%

increase

from last year. This

increase

reflects a

1%

decrease

in organic sales, a

1% decrease

from foreign currency translation and a

7% increase

from acquisitions/divestitures (Acquisitions: SFC Koenig - September 2016; AWG Fittings - July 2016; Akron Brass - March 2016; CiDRA Precision Services - July 2015; Alfa Valvole - June 2015 and Novotema - June 2015. Divestitures: CVI Korea - December 2016; IETG - October 2016; CVI Japan - September 2016; Hydra-Stop - July 2016 and Ismatec - July 2015). Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 50% of total sales in both


and


.

In


, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 40% of sales and 44% of operating income; Health & Science Technologies contributed 35% of sales and 31% of operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products contributed 25% of sales and 25% of operating income.

Gross profit of

$930.8 million

in


increased

$26.5 million

, or

3%

, from


, while gross margin decreased 80 basis points to

44.0

% in


from

44.8%

in


. The increase in gross profit is primarily a result of increased sales volume as a result of acquisitions, while the margin decrease is mainly attributable to $14.7 million of fair value inventory step up charges from 2016 acquisitions compared to $3.4 million from 2015 acquisitions.

SG&A expenses

increased

to

$499.0 million

in


from

$479.4 million

in


. The

$19.6 million

increase

is mainly attributable to $41.4 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions and $3.6 million of pension settlement charges in 2016, partially offset by current year divestitures and cost savings from prior year restructuring actions. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were

23.6%

for


and

23.7%

for


.

During 2016, the Company recorded a $22.3 million pre-tax loss on the sale of businesses related to the four divestitures during the year (Hydra-Stop - July 2016; CVI Japan - September 2016; IETG - October 2016; and CVI Korea - December 2016), compared to the $18.1 million pre-tax gain on the sale of a business in 2015 (Ismatec - July 2015).



During


, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling

$3.7 million

as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization. In


, the Company recorded

$11.2 million

of restructuring expenses mainly attributable to employee severance from headcount reductions across all three segments and corporate.

Operating income of

$405.8 million

in


decreased

from

$431.7 million

in


, primarily resulted from the impact of the four divestitures in 2016 and the associated loss compared to the one divestiture in 2015 and the associated gain as well as the $3.6 million pension settlement charge in 2016 and the incremental fair value inventory step-up charges related to the 2016 acquisitions, partially offset by the reversal of $4.7 million of contingent consideration related to a 2015 acquisition and lower restructuring costs recorded in 2016 compared to 2015. Operating margin of

19.2%

in


was

down


basis points from

21.4%

in


primarily due to the loss on the sale of businesses in 2016 compared to a gain on the sale of a business in 2015, and the 2016 pension settlement, partially offset by productivity improvements and lower restructuring costs year over year.

Other (income) expense

increased

$6.1 million

from

income

of

$2.2 million

in


to

income

of

$8.3 million

in


mainly due to $4.7 million of foreign currency transaction gains on intercompany loans that were established in conjunction with the SFC Koenig acquisition.

Interest expense

increased

to

$45.6 million

in


from

$41.6 million

in


. The

increase

was primarily due to the $200 million series of Senior Notes issued in 2016 and higher borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Facility.

The provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes

decreased

to

$97.4 million

in


compared to

$109.5 million

in


. The effective tax rate

decreased

to

26.4%

in


compared to

27.9%

in


, due to tax benefits on the divestitures of CVI Korea and CVI Japan, certain return-to-provision adjustments and the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the related tax effects of share based payments now recognized as a reduction to income tax expense. These adjustments were offset by the incurrence of additional foreign withholding taxes, the prior year revaluation of the Italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the Italian statutory tax rate and tax expense on the divestiture of the Hydra-Stop product line and the prior year divestiture of the Ismatec product line as well as the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.

Sales within our Energy platform increased compared to 2015 primarily due to strength within the aviation market, partially offset by continued weakness in the propane and oil and gas markets as well as challenges in the mobile end market. Sales within our Pumps platform (formerly Industrial) decreased compared to 2015 due to weakness in the North American industrial distribution market. Sales within the Water platform decreased due to the divestitures of Hydra-Stop and IETG and slowing demand in the chemical end market, partially offset by increased municipal spending. Sales within our Agriculture platform increased year over year due to increased demand in the second half of 2016 from both OEMs and distributors in anticipation of the 2017 planting season. Sales within the Valves platform, which was created in the third quarter of 2015, increased as a result of the full year impact of the Alfa Valvole acquisition, offset by a challenging oil & gas market and overall weakness in the European market.

Sales within our Scientific Fluidics & Optics platform were down year over year due to a slowed demand in the industrial and laser optics end markets as well as the impact of the CVI Japan and CVI Korea divestitures in 2016 and the Ismatec divestiture in 2015 partially offset by strong demand in the core biotech and in-vitro diagnostic markets coupled with the full year impact of the CiDRA Precision Services acquisition and a strong semiconductor market. Sales within our Material Processing Technologies platform decreased compared to 2015 due to challenges in the North American markets which offset strength in the European and Indian pharma markets. Sales within our Sealing Solutions platform increased compared to 2015 due to the full year impact of the Novotema acquisition in 2015, the 2016 acquisition of SFC Koenig and continued strength in the semiconductor markets, partially offset by pressure in the oil & gas market. Sales in our Gast and Micropump platforms decreased year over year due to continued softness in the North American industrial distribution markets.

Performance in


Compared with


Sales in 2015 were $2.0 billion, a 6% decrease from 2014. This decrease reflects a 4% decrease in organic sales, a 4% decrease from foreign currency translation and a 2% increase from acquisitions (CiDRA Precision Services — July 2015; Alfa Valvole — June 2015; Novotema — May 2015 and Aegis — April 2014). Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 50% of total sales in both 2015 and 2014.

In 2015, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 43% of sales and 43% of operating income; Health & Science Technologies contributed 36% of sales and 33% of operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products contributed 21% of sales and 24% of operating income.

Gross profit of $904.3 million in 2015 decreased $45.0 million, or 5%, from 2014, while gross margins increased 60 basis points to 44.8% in 2015 from 44.2% in 2014. The margin increase is mainly attributable to benefits from productivity initiatives, partially offset by decreased sales volume.

SG&A expenses decreased to $479.4 million in 2015 from $504.4 million in 2014. The $25.0 million decrease is mainly attributable to a reduction in volume-related expenses of $35.1 million, partially offset by approximately $10.1 million of incremental costs from new acquisitions.  As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were 23.7% for 2015 and 23.5% for 2014.

During 2015, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $11.2 million compared to $13.7 million recorded in 2014. The restructuring expenses for both years were mainly attributable to employee severance related to head count reductions across all three segments and corporate.

Operating income of $431.7 million in 2015 increased slightly from the $431.2 million recorded in 2014, primarily reflecting improved productivity offset by decreased volumes. Operating margin of 21.4% in 2015 was up 130 basis points from 20.1% in 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Ismatec product line and productivity improvements.

Other (income) expense decreased $0.9 million from other income of $3.1 million in 2014 to $2.2 million of income in 2015 mainly due to mark-to-market gains in available for sale securities in 2014 compared to losses in 2015.

Interest expense decreased slightly to $41.6 million in 2015 from $41.9 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the maturation of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes, partially offset by a higher balance on the Revolving Facility.

The provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes decreased to $109.5 million in 2015 compared to $113.1 million in 2014. The effective tax rate decreased to 27.9% in 2015 compared to 28.8% in 2014, due to the revaluation of the Italian deferred tax liability related to the reduction in the Italian statutory tax rate, the disposition of the Ismatec product line and the mix of global pre-tax income among jurisdictions.

Net income for the year of $282.8 million increased from the $279.4 million earned in 2014. Diluted earnings per share in 2015 of $3.62 increased $0.17 from $3.45 in 2014.

Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment

Sales of $860.8 million decreased $38.8 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This decrease reflected a 2% decline in organic sales, a 2% increase from acquisitions (Alfa Valvole — June 2015 and Aegis — April 2014) and 4% of unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2015, sales decreased approximately 3% domestically and 5% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 44% of total segment sales in 2015, compared with 45% in 2014.



Sales within our Energy platform decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to the fall in oil prices and the related delay in large capital projects in Europe and the Middle East. Sales within our Pumps platform (formerly Industrial) similarly decreased compared to 2014 due to the fall in oil & gas prices, but also due to the weakening of the North American industrial distribution market. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in European chemical project activity. Sales within our Agriculture platform decreased as OEM and after-market distribution sales fell significantly due to depressed commodity prices and lower farm incomes. The slight sales decrease in the Water platform was driven by weakness in North American industrial markets, offset by growth in the global municipal markets and share gains from new products. Sales in the Valves platform, which was created in the third quarter of 2015, increased as a result of the Alfa acquisition.

Operating income and operating margin of $204.5 million and 23.8%; respectively, were lower than the $216.9 million and 24.1%; respectively, recorded in 2014, primarily due to the lower sales volume.

Health & Science Technologies Segment

Sales of $739.0 million decreased $13.0 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This decrease reflected a 1% decline in organic sales, a 2% increase from acquisitions (CiDRA Precision Services — July 2015 and Novotema — May 2015) and 3% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2015, sales decreased 3% domestically and 1% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 55% of total segment sales in 2015 compared with 54% in 2014.

Sales within our Scientific Fluidics & Optics platform increased as demand from the core biotech, in-vitro diagnostic and analytical instrumentation markets grew and remained consistently strong through the year, partially offset by from slow demand in the industrial and laser optical end markets. Sales within our Material Processing Technologies platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softer orders in the first half of the year, as general spending on large capital projects declined. Sales within our Sealing Solutions platform increased compared to 2014 due to the acquisition of Novotema and strong growth in the semiconductor markets, partially offset by declines in the oil & gas market. Sales in our Gast platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softness in North American industrial distribution markets. Sales in our Micropump platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softness in Asian printing markets, and declines in the North American industrial distribution market.

Operating income and operating margin of $157.9 million and 21.4%, respectively, in 2015 were up from $153.0 million and 20.3%, respectively, recorded in 2014, primarily due to productivity initiatives, partially offset by lower volume.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products Segment

Sales of $423.9 million decreased $78.8 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This decrease reflected a 10% decline in organic sales and 6% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2015, sales decreased 12% domestically and 19% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 52% of total segment sales in 2015, compared with 54% in 2014.

Sales within our Dispensing platform decreased due to the benefit of large projects in the first half of the prior year and softness in Asian markets. The sales decrease in our Band-It platform was driven by the decline of upstream oil & gas sales, due to depressed prices, slightly offset by continued strength in the North American transportation markets. Sales within our Fire & Safety platform decreased due to prior year trailer sales for North American power production facilities, a lack of project orders in China and North America, and continued decision delays on municipal projects in Europe and Asia.

Operating income of $115.7 million was lower than the $130.5 million recorded in 2014, while operating margin of 27.3% was higher than the 26.0% recorded in 2014, primarily due to favorable mix within the Dispensing platform along with productivity improvements across the entire segment, partially offset by lower volume.

, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled

$236.0 million

, of which

$190.3 million

was held outside of the United States.

Investing Activities

Cash flows used in investing activities increased

$298.7 million

to

$509.2 million

in


, primarily as a result of an additional $315.0 million of cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by $11.4 million of higher proceeds from the sale of businesses and $5.5 million of lower capital expenditures.

Cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of

$38.2 million

and

$43.8 million

in


and


, respectively. Capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that improved productivity, although a portion was for business system technology, replacement of equipment, and construction of  new facilities. Management believes that the Company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term.

The Company acquired Akron Brass in March 2016 for cash consideration of

$221.4 million

; AWG Fittings in July 2016 for cash consideration of

$47.5 million

(€42.8 million); and SFC Koenig in September 2016 for cash consideration of

$241.1 million

(€215.9 million). The purchase prices for the 2016 acquisitions were funded with both cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving facilities. The Company acquired Novotema in May 2015 for cash consideration of $61.1 million (€56 million); Alfa Valvole in June 2015 for cash consideration of $112.6 million (€99.8 million); and CPS in July 2015 for cash consideration of $19.5 million and non-cash contingent consideration valued at $4.7 million.  The entire purchase price for all of the 2015 acquisitions was funded with cash on hand.

Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities increased from $295.5 million of cash used in financing activities in 2015 to

$46.5 million

of cash provided by financing activities in


, primarily as a result of the Company paying off the $88.4 million balance on the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes in 2015, a reduction of $153.6 million of purchases of common stock in 2016, and the issuance of $200 million of Senior Notes in 2016.

On June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of

$100 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.20%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 and

$100 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.37%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (collectively, the “Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Each series of Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13

th

and December 13

th

. The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the Notes; provided that such portion is greater than

5%

of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the Notes by making an offer to all holders of the Notes, subject to certain conditions.

The Company maintains a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which is a $700.0 million unsecured, multi-currency bank credit facility expiring on June 23, 2020. At

December 31, 2016

, there was

$169.6 million

outstanding under the Revolving Facility and

$9.2 million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

December 31, 2016

of

$521.2 million

. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. This applicable margin is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from

.005%

to

1.50%

. Based on the Company’s credit rating at

December 31, 2016

, the applicable margin was

1.10%

, resulting in a weighted average interest rate of

1.50%

at

December 31, 2016

. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed

$350.0 million

. An annual Revolving Facility fee, also based on the Company’s credit rating, is currently 15 basis points and is payable quarterly.

On June 9, 2015, the Company paid the balance of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes, upon its maturity, using cash on hand.

On December 9, 2011, the Company completed a public offering of $350.0 million 4.2% senior notes due December 15, 2021 (“4.2% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering of $346.2 million, after deducting a $0.9 million issuance



discount, a $2.3 million underwriting commission and $0.6 million offering expenses, were used to repay $306.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. The 4.2% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.2% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The Company may redeem all or part of the 4.2% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Note Indenture governing the 4.2% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and 4.2% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.2% Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.2% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

On December 6, 2010, the Company completed a public offering of $300.0 million 4.5% senior notes due December 15, 2020 (“4.5% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering of $295.7 million, after deducting a $1.6 million issuance discount, a $1.9 million underwriting commission and $0.8 million offering expenses, were used to repay $250.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. The 4.5% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the 4.5% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Note Indenture governing the 4.5% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and 4.5% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.5% Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.5% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the Notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of

3.0

to


and a maximum leverage ratio of

3.50

to


. At

December 31, 2016

, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company’s interest coverage ratio was

11.51

to 1 and the leverage ratio was

1.91

to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 4.5% Senior Notes or 4.2% Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions.

On

December 1, 2015

the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase of

$300.0 million

in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility. During


, the Company purchased a total of

0.7 million

shares at a cost of

$55.0 million

compared to

2.8 million

shares purchased in


at a cost of

$210.5 million

, of which $2.3 million was settled in January 2016. As of

December 31, 2016

, there was

$580 million

of repurchase authorization remaining.

The Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock for the next twelve months. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. As of

December 31, 2016

,

$169.6 million

was outstanding under the Revolving Facility, with

$9.2 million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

December 31, 2016

of approximately

$521.2 million

.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary course of business. There are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of our credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at

December 31, 2016

, and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional detail regarding these obligations is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”



(1)

Includes interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates for variable debt.

(2)

Consists primarily of tangible personal property leases.

(3)

Consists primarily of inventory commitments.

(4)

Comprises liabilities recorded on the balance sheet of $1,110.5 million, and obligations not recorded on the balance sheet of $396.0 million.

Critical Accounting Policies

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Revenue recognition

— The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and

collectability

of the sales price is reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including the combination of products and services. In such cases, the Company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with ASC 605-25,

Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements

, and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method. Revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets

— The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations. An impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.  Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived or indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually.  On October 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists.  The amount and

timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets.  In


and


, the Company concluded that certain long-lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets, resulting in

$0.2 million

and

$0.8 million

, respectively, of long-lived asset impairment charges.



The Company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in ASC 350,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. To determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the Company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations.

The key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted EBITDA, and terminal growth rates. The


and


ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the Company are as follows:

In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month EBITDA and the forward looking 2017 EBITDA (generally 50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. The market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted EBITDA and selected market multiples. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.

In addition to performing our annual impairment test, we also performed interim impairment tests due to the divestitures in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the reorganization of certain reporting units.  As a result of these impairment tests, the Company concluded that the reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values.

The Banjo trade name is an indefinite-lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

The Akron Brass trade name is an indefinite-lived intangible asset that was acquired as a result of the Akron Brass acquisition in March 2016 and is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

In


and


, there were no triggering events or changes in circumstances that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date. Based on the results of our measurement as of October 31,


, the fair value of the Banjo trade name was more than 25% in excess of the carrying value and the fair value of the Akron Brass trade name was near its carrying value as a result of the acquisition of this business in March 2016.

Defined benefit retirement plans —

The plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets. Plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the Company. Key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and the estimated future return on plan assets. To the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts, results could be adversely affected.



The Society of Actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables, which update life expectancy assumptions. IDEX adopts these annual updates and, in consideration of these tables, we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2016

, which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years. New mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans. These expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the (gain) loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”), which in turn, may impact the Company’s funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. Each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the PBO of approximately $27 million based upon the

December 31, 2016

data.  Each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the PBO of approximately $33 million based upon the

December 31, 2016

data.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Under the policy, the Company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes, and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

The Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the Euro, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee and Chinese Renminbi. The Company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of products. The foreign currency transaction (gains) losses for the years ending

December 31, 2016

,


and


were

$(6.2) million

,

$(0.1) million

, and

$0.9 million

, respectively, and are reported within Other (income) expense-net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Interest Rate Fluctuations

The Company’s interest rate exposure is primarily related to its

$1,020.9 million

of total debt outstanding at

December 31, 2016

. Approximately

17%

of the debt is priced at interest rates that float with the market. A 50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the floating rate debt would result in an approximate

$0.8 million

annualized increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows. The remaining debt is fixed rate debt.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.

Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2016

.

The Company completed the acquisitions of Akron Brass Holding Corporation in March 2016, AWG Fittings GmbH in July 2016 and SFC Koenig AG in August 2016. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management has excluded these acquisitions from our evaluation of effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. This exclusion represented

6.3%

of net sales and

19.4%

of total assets of the Company for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEX Corporation

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Akron Brass Holding Corporation, which was acquired in March 2016; AWG Fittings GmbH, which was acquired in July 2016; and SFC Koenig AG, which was acquired in August 2016. These exclusions collectively represented

6.3%

of net sales and 19.4% of total assets of the Company for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Akron Brass Holding Corporation, AWG Fittings GmbH, and SFC Koenig AG. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2016

of the Company and our report dated

February 23, 2017

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEX Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

Significant Accounting Policies

Business

IDEX is an applied solutions company specializing in fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies, and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers’ specifications. IDEX’s products are sold in niche markets to a wide range of industries throughout the world. The Company’s products include industrial pumps, compressors, flow meters, injectors and valves, and related controls for use in a wide variety of process applications; precision fluidics solutions, including pumps, valves, degassing equipment, corrective tubing, fittings, and complex manifolds, optical filters and specialty medical equipment and devices for use in life science applications; precision-engineered equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing paints; and engineered products for industrial and commercial markets, including fire and rescue, transportation equipment, oil & gas, electronics, and communications. These activities are grouped into

three

reportable segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, recoverability of long-lived assets, income taxes, product warranties, contingencies and litigation, insurance-related items, defined benefit retirement plans and purchase accounting related to acquisitions.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided or ratably over the contract term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables, including the combination of products and services. In such cases, the Company has identified these as separate elements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605-25,

Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements

, and recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate element based on the relative selling price method. Revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of sales and are recognized as a period expense during the period in which they are incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs of

$15.3 million

,

$16.1 million

and

$14.5 million

for


,


and


, respectively, are expensed as incurred within Selling, general and administrative expenses.



Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of

90 days or less

to be cash and cash equivalents.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers’ inability to make required payments. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost, which includes material, labor, and factory overhead, is determined on a FIFO basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering changes.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, as measured by comparing their net book value to the projected undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use.  A long-lived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  The amount and

timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets.  Impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis.  In


,


, and


, the Company concluded that certain long-lived assets had a fair value that was less than the carrying value of the assets, resulting in

$0.2 million

,

$0.8 million

and

$2.5 million

, respectively, of long-lived asset impairment charges.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

In accordance with ASC 350,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, the Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually on October 31, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these assets based on the estimated fair value of each of the thirteen reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 4 for a further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.

Borrowing Expenses

Expenses incurred in securing and issuing debt are capitalized and included as a reduction of Long-term borrowings. These amounts are amortized over the life of the related borrowing and the related amortization is included in Interest expense.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents (diluted) outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options, which have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, restricted stock, performance share units, and shares issuable in connection with certain deferred compensation agreements (“DCUs”).

ASC 260,

Earnings per Share

, concludes that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. If awards are considered participating securities, the Company is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its outstanding shares of restricted stock are participating securities. Accordingly, EPS was computed using the two-class method prescribed by ASC 260. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the purpose of calculating EPS was reduced by

$0.5 million

,

$0.8 million

and

$1.3 million

in


,


and


, respectively.



Basic weighted average shares outstanding reconciles to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows:

Options to purchase approximately

0.9 million

,

0.9 million

and

0.5 million

shares of common stock in


,


and


, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718,

Compensation-Stock Compensation

. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based compensation plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 13 for further discussion on share-based compensation.

Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Certain identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives used in the computation of amortization of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:

Research and Development Expenditures

Costs associated with research and development are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Cost of sales. Research and development expenses, which include costs associated with developing new products and major improvements to existing products, were

$39.4 million

,

$33.6 million

and

$36.8 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of substantially all operations outside the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly, those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. The gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The foreign currency transaction losses (gains) for the periods ending

December 31, 2016

,


and


were

$(6.2) million

,

$(0.1) million

, and

$0.9 million

, respectively, and are reported within Other (income) expense-net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the

$6.2 million

reported as foreign currency transaction gains for the period ending December 31, 2016,

$4.7 million

was due to intercompany loans established in conjunction with the SFC Koenig acquisition.



Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes United States, state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is not dependent on a single customer as its largest customer accounted for less than

2%

of net sales for all years presented.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09,

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The Company applied this standard prospectively and thus, prior periods have not been adjusted. The impact of the adoption resulted in the following:

•

The Company recorded a tax benefit of

$6.8 million

within Provision for income taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2016

, related to the excess tax benefit on stock options, restricted stock and performance share units. Prior to adoption this amount would have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. The adoption of this standard could create volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate going forward.

•

The Company elected not to change our policy on accounting for forfeitures and continued to estimate the total number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered.

•

The Company no longer reclassifies the excess tax benefit from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows.

•

The Company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of our diluted earnings per share for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. This increased our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding by

127 thousand

shares for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,

Interest-Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08,

Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity

, which includes amendments that change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations with a major effect on the organization’s operations and financial results should be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, the ASU requires expanded disclosures about disposal transactions that do not meet the discontinued operations criteria. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2015 and the adoption did not impact the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. The Company concluded that none of the divestitures that took place during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 met the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations. The Company did include required disclosures of disposals of components of an entity in Note 2.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

, which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.  Under this ASU, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.  This ASU also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative



assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.  In addition, companies will be required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. The update is effective for annual and any interim impairment tests for periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

, which amends ASC 740,

Income Taxes

.  This ASU requires that the income tax consequences of an intra-entity asset transfer other than inventory are recognized at the time of the transfer. An entity will continue to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of inventory when the inventory is sold to a third party. The update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The ASU requires adoption on a modified-retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

(a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not believe the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors).  The standard introduces a new lessee model that will require most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet and eliminates the required use of bright line tests in current U.S. GAAP for determining lease classification.  The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.  This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Companies are permitted to adopt the standard early and a modified retrospective application is required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a new five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  Under ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption. The FASB has also issued the following standards which clarify ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard: ASU 2016-08,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

; ASU 2016-10,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing

; ASU 2016-12

,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients

; and ASU 2016-20

, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

In 2016, we established an implementation team and analyzed the impact of the standard by surveying business units and reviewing contracts to identify potential differences that may result from applying the requirements of the new standard.  We have made significant progress on our contract reviews during 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.  While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we currently believe that the most significant potential change relates to contracts for the development, manufacture and sale of customized products in our Health & Science Technologies segment.  Due to the complexity of certain contracts in our Health & Science Technologies segment, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms. However, under the new standard we expect revenue recognition



to remain substantially unchanged as the contract reviews support the recognition of revenue at a point in time, which is consistent with our current revenue recognition model.  We also expect revenue related to the Fluid & Metering Technologies segment and the Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment to remain substantially unchanged.  The implementation team has reported these initial findings and progress of the project to the Audit Committee.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard in 2018.

2.      Acquisitions and Divestitures

All of the Company’s acquisitions have been accounted for under ASC 805,

Business Combinations

.

4.       Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for


and


, by reportable business segment, were as follows:

ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives were tested for impairment as of October 31,


, the Company’s annual impairment date. In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month EBITDA and the forward looking


EBITDA (generally 50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies.  The market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted EBITDA and selected market multiples. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and the income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.



In addition to performing our annual impairment test, we also performed interim impairment tests due to the divestitures in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 as well as the reorganization of certain reporting units.  As a result of these impairment tests, the Company concluded that the reporting units had fair values in excess of their carrying values.

The following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset at

December 31, 2016

and


:

The Banjo trade name is an indefinite-lived intangible asset which is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of the Banjo trade name. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

The Akron Brass trade name is an indefinite-lived intangible asset that was acquired as a result of the Akron Brass acquisition in March 2016 and is tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of the Akron Brass trade name. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

In


and


, there were no events that occurred or circumstances that changed that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date. Based on the results of our measurement as of October 31,


, the fair value of the Banjo trade name was more than

25%

in excess of the carrying value and the fair value of the Akron Brass trade name was near its carrying value as a result of the acquisition of this business in March 2016.

Amortization of intangible assets was

aggregate principal amount of

3.37%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (collectively, the “Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Each series of Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13

th

and December 13

th

. The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the Notes; provided that such portion is greater than

5%

of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the Notes by making an offer to all holders of the Notes, subject to certain conditions.

The Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, incur indebtedness, create liens, transact with affiliates and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or other change of control transactions. In addition, the Company must comply with a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, as further described below, and the Purchase Agreement also limits the outstanding principal amount of priority debt that may be incurred by the Company to

15%

of consolidated assets. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment event of default, any holder of the Notes affected thereby may declare all the Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of Notes may declare all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) along with certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, with other agents party thereto.  The Credit Agreement replaces the Company’s existing

five

-year

$700 million

credit agreement, dated as of June 27, 2011, which was due to expire on June 27, 2016.

The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of

$700 million

, with a final maturity date of

June 23, 2020

. The maturity date may be extended under certain conditions for an additional

one

-year term. Up to

$75 million

of the Revolving Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to

$50 million

of the Revolving Facility is available to the Company for swing line loans, available on a same-day basis.

Proceeds of the Revolving Facility are available for use by the Borrowers for acquisitions, working capital and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed

$350 million

. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate

certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation,

the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries.



Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from

.005%

to

1.50%

. Based on the Company’s credit rating at

December 31, 2016

, the applicable margin was

1.10%

resulting in a weighted average interest rate of

1.50%

at

December 31, 2016

. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months.

The Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon (a) the amount of the lenders’ commitments under the credit facility from time to time and (b) the applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the credit facility are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements.

The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations (each of which is subject to customary exceptions for financings of this type) on our ability to grant liens; enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company); restrict subsidiary dividends or other subsidiary distributions; enter into transactions with the Company’s affiliates; and incur certain additional subsidiary debt.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate) including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the representations or warranties in any material respect; breach of the financial, affirmative or negative covenants; payment default on, or acceleration of, other material indebtedness; bankruptcy or insolvency; material judgments entered against the Company or any of its subsidiaries; certain specified events under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain changes in control of the Company; and the invalidity or unenforceability of the Credit Agreement or other documents associated with the Credit Agreement.

and


, the Company did not have any interest rate or foreign exchange contracts outstanding. The type of cash flow hedges the Company has entered into includes interest rate exchange agreements that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and are designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense.

The effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate exchange agreements is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is recognized into net income during the period of change.

7.      Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820, “

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,

” defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

•

Level 1:    Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:    Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

•

Level 3:    Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

The following table summarizes the basis used to measure the Company’s financial assets (liabilities) at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets at

December 31, 2016

and


:

There were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in


or


.

In determining the fair value of the contingent consideration potentially due on the acquisition of CPS, the Company used probability weighted estimates of EBITDA during the earn-out period. The

$4.7 million

represented management’s best estimate of the liability as of the opening balance sheet date and December 31, 2015, based on a range of outcomes of CPS’s 12 month operating results, from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company re-evaluated the contingent consideration arrangement and fully reversed the

$4.7 million

liability based on CPS’s actual operating results from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. The

$4.7 million

reversal was recognized as a benefit within Selling, general and administrative expenses.

The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments. At

December 31, 2016

, the fair value of the outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Facility,

3.2%

Senior Notes,

3.37%

Senior Notes,

4.5%

Senior Notes and

4.2%

Senior Notes, based on quoted market prices and current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity, was approximately

$1,029.9 million

compared to the carrying value of

$1,018.4 million

. This fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since it is determined based upon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions to entities with a credit rating similar to ours.

8.    Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases certain office facilities, warehouses and data processing equipment under operating leases. Rental expense totaled

$18.6 million

On

December 1, 2015

the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock by

$300.0 million

. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility. During

and


, was as follows:

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) at

December 31, 2016

and


were:

The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2016

and


were:



The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income. The computed amount and the differences for


,


and


are as follows:

The Company has

$670 million

and

$715 million

of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31,


and


, respectively. No deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on these earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so. If these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with the hypothetical calculation, and the amount of liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances if and when remittance occurs. During the years ended December 31,


,


and


, the Company repatriated

$28.8 million

,

$14.3 million

and

$6.5 million

of foreign earnings, respectively, resulting in

$2.7 million

of incremental tax expense,

$0.3 million

of incremental income tax expense and

$0.2 million

of incremental tax benefit, respectively. These repatriations represent distribution

s

of current year earnings and distributions from liquidating subsidiaries and do not impact our representation that the undistributed earnings are permanently invested.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for


,


and


is as follows:



We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we had approximately

$0.1 million

,

$0.2 million

and

$0.7 million

, respectively, of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. As of

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we had approximately

$0.1 million

,

$0.3 million

and

$0.3 million

, respectively, of accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized is

$1.8 million

,

$3.0 million

and

$2.9 million

as of

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively. The tax years 2010-2015 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by a range of

zero

to

$1.4 million

.

The Company had net operating loss and credit carry forwards related to prior acquisitions for U.S. federal purposes at

December 31, 2016

and


of

$3.5

million and

$4.8 million

, respectively. The federal net operating loss carry forwards are available for use against the Company’s consolidated federal taxable income and expire between 2021 and 2028. For non-U.S. purposes, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards at

December 31, 2016

and


of

$25.6

million and

$0.7 million

, respectively, the majority of which relates to acquisitions. The entire balance of the non-U.S. net operating losses is available to be carried forward. At

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company had U.S. state net operating loss and credit carry forwards of approximately

$33.1 million

and

$27.0 million

, respectively. If unutilized, the U.S. state net operating loss will expire between 2019 and 2036. At

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset attributable to the U.S. state net operating loss of

$1.3 million

and

$1.0 million

, respectively.

The Company had a capital loss carryover for U.S. federal purposes at

December 31, 2016

of approximately

$70.1 million

. U.S. capital loss carryovers can be carried back three years and forward five years, thus, if unutilized, the federal capital loss carryover will expire in 2021. At

December 31, 2016

, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset attributable to the federal capital loss carryover of

$18.7 million

.  At

December 31, 2016

, the Company had U.S. state capital loss carryovers of approximately

$70.1 million

. If unutilized, the U.S. state capital loss carryovers will expire between 2021 and 2031.  At

December 31, 2016

, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to the state capital loss carryovers of

$0.7 million

. At

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, are reflected in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

13.    Share-Based Compensation

The Company maintains

two

share-based compensation plans for executives, non-employee directors and certain key employees that authorize the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance share units, and other types of awards consistent with the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s plans as of

December 31, 2016

totaled

15.6 million

, of which

5.4 million

shares were available for future issuance. The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, assuming forfeitures, over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Stock Options

Stock options granted under IDEX plans are generally non-qualified and are granted

with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. The majority of the options issued to employees become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning one year from the date of grant, and generally expire

10 years

from the date of grant. Stock options granted to non-employee directors cliff vest after

one year

.

Weighted average option fair values and assumptions for the period are as follows:



The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the contractual term of the option.

•

The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life of the option. The expected life assumption for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


is an output of the Binomial lattice option-pricing model, which incorporates vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option to define expected employee behavior.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option. For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, we present the range of risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice option-pricing model.

•

The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the option.

A summary of the Company’s stock option activity as of

December 31, 2016

, and changes during the year ended

December 31, 2016

is presented as follows:

The intrinsic value for stock options outstanding and exercisable is defined as the difference between the market value of the Company’s common stock as of the end of the period and the grant price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in


,


and


was

,

$16.9 million

and

$20.0 million

, respectively. In


,


and


, cash received from options exercised was

,

$6.1 million

and

$7.3 million

, respectively.

Total compensation cost for stock options is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

As of

December 31, 2016

there was

$10.8 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.4 years

.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards generally cliff vest after three years for employees and non-employee directors. Unvested restricted stock carries dividend and voting rights and the sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting. Dividends are paid on restricted stock awards and their fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of the



grant. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity as of December 31,


, and changes during the year ending December 31,


is as follows:

Total compensation cost for restricted stock is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

As of

December 31, 2016

there was

$5.3 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.1 years

.

Cash-Settled Restricted Stock

The Company also maintains a cash-settled share based compensation plan for certain employees. Cash-settled restricted stock awards generally cliff vest after

three years

. Dividend equivalents are paid on certain cash-settled restricted stock awards. A summary of the Company’s unvested cash-settled restricted stock activity as of December 31,


, and changes during the year ending December 31,


is as follows:



Total compensation cost for cash-settled restricted stock is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

At December 31,


and


, the Company has

$3.0 million

and

$3.2 million

, respectively, included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and

$2.4 million

and

$1.8 million

, respectively, included in Other non-current liabilities.

Performance Share Units

Beginning in 2013 the Company granted performance share units to selected key employees that may be earned based on IDEX total shareholder return over the three-year period following the date of grant. Performance share units are expected to be made annually and are paid out at the end of a

three

-year period based on the Company’s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of IDEX common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of the S&P Midcap 400 Industrial Group (for awards granted prior to 2016) or the Russell Midcap Index (for awards granted in 2016) for the three-year period following the date of grant. The payment of awards following the three-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from


percent to


percent of the initial grant. A target payout of


percent is earned if total shareholder return is equal to the 50

th

percentile of the peer group. Performance share units earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of performance share units that are earned. Payments made at the end of the award period will be in the form of stock for performance share units and will be in cash for dividend equivalents. The Company’s performance share awards are considered performance condition awards and the grant date fair value of the awards, based on a Monte Carlo simulation model, is expensed ratably over the three-year term of the awards. The Company granted approximately

0.1 million

of performance share units in each of


,


and


.

Weighted average performance share unit fair values and assumptions for the period specified are as follows:

The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the remaining performance period as of the grant date.

•

The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses an expected life commensurate with the performance period. As a result, the expected life of the performance share units was assumed to be the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term commensurate with the remaining performance period.



•

Total Shareholder Return is determined assuming that dividends are reinvested in the issuing entity over the performance period, which is mathematically equivalent to utilizing a

0%

dividend yield.

A summary of the Company’s performance share unit activity as of

December 31, 2016

, and changes during the year ending

December 31, 2016

is as follows:

Awards that vested in


will result in

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance shares that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.0 year

.

14. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of Other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:



Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income are summarized as follows:

15.    Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement plans for its employees. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans. The Company employs the measurement date provisions of ASC 715,

Compensation-Retirement Benefits

, which require the measurement date of plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor’s year end.

During 2016, the Company offered a voluntary lump-sum pension payment opportunity to certain terminated vested U.S. pension plan participants. Total lump-sum payments of

$11.0 million

were made for those participants electing to receive lump sums using pension plan assets. The Company recognized pretax settlement losses of

$3.5 million

in the fourth quarter of 2016 for those plans where the settlement payment exceeded the sum of the plans' service and interest costs.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets over the two-year period ended

December 31, 2016

, and a statement of the funded status at December 31 for both years.



The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for all defined benefit pension plans was

$176.7 million

and

$150.4 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligation at

December 31, 2016

and


were as follows:



The pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2016

and


were as follows:

The amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2016

, that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during


are as follows:

The components of, and the weighted average assumptions used to determine, the net periodic benefit cost for the plans in


,


and


are as follows:



The pretax change recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in


is as follows:

The discount rates for our plans are derived by matching the plan’s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same present value of cash flows.

In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the plan’s target asset allocation and current market conditions.

Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of

10%

of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.

Costs of defined contribution plans were

$10.1 million

,

$10.3 million

and

$9.1 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in certain multi-employer pension plans covering approximately


participants under U.S. collective bargaining agreements. None of these plans are considered individually significant to the Company as contributions to these plans totaled

$1.3 million

,

$1.0 million

, and

$1.0 million

for


,


and


, respectively.

For measurement purposes, a

6.58%

weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for


. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually each year to a rate of

4.50%

for


, and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A

1%

increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by

$0.2 million

and the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by

$2.1 million

. A

1%

decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by

$0.1 million

and the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by

$1.8 million

.



Plan Assets

The Company’s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at

December 31, 2016

and


, by asset category, were as follows:

The basis used to measure the defined benefit plans’ assets at fair value at

December 31, 2016

and


is summarized as follows:



Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors.

Investment Policies and Strategies

The investment objective of the plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn the highest possible total rate of return consistent with the plan’s tolerance for risk. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that “equities” will constitute from

40%

to

60%

of the market value of total fund assets with a target of

44%

, and “fixed income” obligations, including cash, will constitute from

40%

to

60%

with a target of

56%

. The term “equities” includes common stock, convertible bonds and convertible stock. The term “fixed income” includes preferred stock and/or contractual payments with a specific maturity date. The Company strives to maintain asset allocations within the designated ranges by conducting periodic reviews of fund allocations and plan liquidity needs, and rebalancing the portfolio accordingly. Diversification of assets is employed to ensure that adverse performance of one security or security class does not have an undue detrimental impact on the portfolio as a whole. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by type, characteristic and number of investments, as well as by investment style of designated investment fund managers. No restrictions are placed on the selection of individual investments by the investment fund managers. The total fund performance and the performance of the investment fund managers is reviewed on a regular basis, using appointed professional independent advisors. As of December 31,


and


, there were no shares of the Company’s stock held in plan assets.

Cash Flows

The Company expects to contribute approximately

$5.8 million

to its defined benefit plans and

$0.1 million

to its other postretirement benefit plans in


. The Company also expects to contribute approximately

$10.0 million

to its defined contribution plan and

$8.4 million

to its 401(k) savings plan in


.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The future estimated benefit payments for the next five years and the five years thereafter are as follows:


—

$14.4 million

;


—

$10.6 million

;


—

$10.3 million

;


—

$10.8 million

;


—

$10.6 million

; 2022 to 2026 —

$52.1 million

On January 31, 2017 the Company entered into

four

forward contracts with a combined notional value of

€180 million

and a settlement date of March 31, 2017. These contracts were executed to minimize the earnings impact due to foreign currency fluctuations between the Swiss Franc and the Euro associated with certain intercompany loans that were established in conjunction with the SFC Koenig acquisition.
