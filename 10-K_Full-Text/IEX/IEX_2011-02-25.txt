Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

For an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide
    range of factors could materially affect future developments and
    performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific
    business operations identified in connection with the
    description of those operations and the financial results of
    these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant
    factors affecting our operations include the following:

CHANGES
    IN U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY
    AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

In 2010, 51% of the Company’s revenue was derived from
    domestic operations while 49% was derived from international
    operations. The Company’s largest markets include life
    sciences and medical technologies, fire and rescue, petroleum
    LPG, paint and coatings, chemical processing and water and
    wastewater treatment. A slowdown in the economy and in
    particular any of these specific end markets could directly
    affect the Company’s revenue stream and profitability.

POLITICAL
    CONDITIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD
    ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

In 2010, approximately 49% of our total sales were to customers
    outside the U.S. We expect our international operations and
    export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable
    future. Both our sales from international operations and export
    sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing
    business outside the United States. These risks include the
    following:

•

possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host
    country laws or regulations;

•

risks of economic instability;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency
    repatriation;

•

potential negative consequences from changes to taxation
    policies;

•

the disruption of operations from labor and political
    disturbances;

•

changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export
    licensing requirements; and,

•

insurrection or war.

We cannot predict the impact such future, largely unforeseeable
    events might have on the Company’s operations.

AN
    INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS CAN LIMIT THE
    COMPANY’S REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.

The Company’s revenue grew organically by 12% in 2010, but
    was down 14% in 2009. Approximately 19% of our revenue was
    derived from new products developed over the past three years.
    Our ability to continue to grow organically is tied to our
    ability to continue to develop new products.



OUR
    GROWTH STRATEGY INCLUDES ACQUISITIONS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
    MAKE ACQUISITIONS OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES OR INTEGRATE
    ACQUISITIONS SUCCESSFULLY.

Our historical growth has included, and our future growth is
    likely to continue to include acquisitions. We intend to
    continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into
    new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets
    throughout the world. We cannot be assured, however, that we
    will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates,
    negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing which
    may be needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete
    proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired
    businesses into our existing operations or expand into new
    markets. In addition, we cannot assure you that any acquisition,
    once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be
    accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our
    operations and cash flow.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of
    undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the
    assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and
    products of the acquired companies and the diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns. In
    addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
    acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial
    additional indebtedness and other expenses. Once integrated,
    acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues,
    profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by
    our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected.

THE
    MARKETS WE SERVE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THIS COMPETITION COULD
    LIMIT THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL AND REDUCE OUR
    OPERATING MARGINS.

Most of our products are sold in competitive markets. We believe
    that the principal points of competition in our markets are
    product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities,
    product development, conformity to customer specifications,
    quality of post-sale support, timeliness of delivery, and
    effectiveness of our distribution channels. Maintaining and
    improving our competitive position will require continued
    investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality
    standards, marketing, customer service and support, and our
    distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining
    our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products
    that are superior to our products, or may develop methods of
    more efficiently and effectively providing products and services
    or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or
    evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures also could
    cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay
    competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with our
    existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to
    continue competing successfully could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flow.

WE ARE
    DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PARTS AND
    COMPONENTS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS.

While we manufacture many of the parts and components used in
    our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials
    and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The
    availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components
    may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other
    things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers,
    interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange
    rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of,
    or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could
    materially affect our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.

SIGNIFICANT
    MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MAY HARM OUR
    FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar,
    British Pound and Chinese Renminbi. Any significant change in
    the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do
    business against the U.S. Dollar could affect our ability
    to sell products competitively and control our cost structure,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. For
    additional detail related to this risk, see Part II.
    Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
    About Market Risk”.



AN
    UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME OF ANY OF OUR PENDING CONTINGENCIES OR
    LITIGATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL
    CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW.

We currently are involved in certain legal and regulatory
    proceedings. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue
    estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these
    matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with
    outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential
    results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement
    strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating
    results for any particular quarter or annual period could be
    materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the
    effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.
    For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3.
    “Legal Proceedings”.

OUR
    INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS
    AND A WRITE-OFF OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT
    OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR NET
    WORTH.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets,
    primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At
    December 31, 2010, goodwill and intangible assets totaled
    $1,207.0 million and $281.4 million, respectively.
    These goodwill and intangible assets result from our
    acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair
    value of the tangible assets we have acquired. Annually, or when
    certain events occur that require a more current valuation, we
    assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our
    goodwill or intangible assets. If future operating performance
    at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly
    below forecast levels, we could be required to reflect, under
    current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to
    operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring
    the write-off of a significant portion of the goodwill or
    intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our
    results of operations and total capitalization.

Item 1B.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments.

The Company has received no written comments regarding its
    periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission that remain unresolved.

Item 2.

Properties.

The Company’s principal plants and offices have an
    aggregate floor space area of approximately 4.0 million
    square feet, of which 2.5 million square feet (62%) is
    located in the U.S. and approximately 1.5 million
    square feet (38%) is located outside the U.S., primarily in
    Germany (8%), Italy (7%), the U.K. (6%), China (4%) and The
    Netherlands (2%). These facilities are considered to be suitable
    and adequate for their operations. Management believes we can
    meet the expected demand increase over the near term with our
    existing facilities, especially given our operational
    improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity. The
    Company’s executive office occupies 32,165 square feet
    of leased space in Lake Forest, Illinois.

Approximately 2.9 million square feet (73%) of the
    principal plant and office floor area is owned by the Company,
    and the balance is held under lease. Approximately
    1.9 million square feet (48%) of the principal plant and
    office floor area is held by business units in the
    Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment;
    0.7 million square feet (18%) is held by business units in
    the Health & Science Technologies Segment;
    0.5 million square feet (12%) is held by business units in
    the Dispensing Equipment Segment; and 0.8 million square
    feet (19%) is held by business units in the Fire &
    Safety/Diversified Products Segment.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

The Company and nine of its subsidiaries are presently named as
    defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various
    asbestos-related personal injuries, allegedly as a result of
    exposure to products manufactured with components that contained
    asbestos. These components were acquired from third party
    suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of the subsidiaries.
    To date, the majority of the Company’s settlements and
    legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration,
    insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have
    been covered in full by insurance subject to applicable
    deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to
    what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover
    such settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond



to claims that are tendered to them. Claims have been filed in
    jurisdictions throughout the United States. Most of the claims
    resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The
    balance have been settled for various insignificant amounts.
    Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the
    Company’s business unit. No provision has been made in the
    financial statements of the Company, other than for insurance
    deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not
    currently believe the asbestos-related claims will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business,
    financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company is also party to various other legal proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is
    expected to have a material adverse effect on its business,
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.

Cautionary
    Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
    Act

This management’s discussion and analysis, including,
    without limitations the section entitled “Historical
    Overview and Outlook” and other portions of this report
    contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
    Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These
    statements may relate to, among other things, capital
    expenditures, cost reductions, cash flow, and operating

Results
    of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
    position and results of operations for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2010. For purposes of this
    discussion and analysis section, reference is made to the table
    on page 16 and the Consolidated Statements of Operations in
    Part II. Item 8. “Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data” on page 26.

Performance
    in 2010 Compared with 2009

Sales in 2010 of $1,513.1 million were 14% higher than the
    $1,329.7 million recorded a year ago. This increase
    reflects a 12% increase in organic sales and 3% from four
    acquisitions (PPE — April 2010, OBL — July
    2010, Periflo — September 2010 and
    Fitzpatrick — November 2010), partially offset by 1%
    unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales
    increased in Fluid & Metering Technologies,
    Health & Science Technologies and Fire &
    Safety/Diversified Products segments, but were flat in the
    Dispensing Equipment segment. Domestic organic sales were up 9%
    versus the prior year, while international organic sales
    increased 15% in 2010. Organic sales to customers outside the
    U.S. represented 49% of total sales in 2010 and 46% in 2009.

In 2010, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 48%
    of sales and 44% of operating income; Health & Science
    Technologies accounted for 26% of sales and 28% of operating
    income; Dispensing Equipment accounted for 8% of sales and 7% of
    operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified
    Products represented 18% of sales and 21% of operating income.

Fluid & Metering Technologies sales of
    $729.9 million in 2010 increased $88.8 million, or
    14%, compared with 2009. This reflects a 13% increase in organic
    sales and 2% for acquisitions (OBL, Periflo and Fitzpatrick),
    partially offset by 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation.
    The increase in organic growth was driven by strong global
    growth across energy, chemical, food & pharma and
    water & wastewater markets. In 2010, organic sales
    increased approximately 13% domestically and 14%
    internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the
    U.S. were approximately 46% of total segment sales in 2010
    and 41% in 2009.

Health & Science Technologies sales of
    $397.2 million increased $92.9 million, or 31%, in
    2010 compared with last year. This change reflects a 21%
    increase in organic growth and a 10% increase from the
    acquisition of PPE. The increase in organic sales reflects
    market strength across all Health & Science
    Technologies products. In 2010, organic sales increased 14%
    domestically and 32% internationally. Organic sales to customers
    outside the U.S. were approximately 43% of total segment
    sales in 2010 and 40% in 2009.

Dispensing Equipment sales of $125.3 million decreased
    $2.0 million, or 2%, in 2010 compared with the prior year.
    This change reflects 2% unfavorable foreign currency
    translation, while organic growth was flat in 2010 compared to
    2009. The Dispensing Equipment Segment experienced strength in
    Asia and parts of Eastern Europe, offset by softness in North
    America and Western Europe. Organic domestic sales decreased 9%
    compared with 2009, while organic international sales increased
    5%. Organic sales to customers outside the U.S. were 67% of
    total segment sales in 2010 and 66% in 2009.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products sales of
    $265.5 million increased $2.7 million, or 1%, in 2010
    compared with 2009. Organic sales activity increased 2%, while
    foreign currency translation accounted for a 1% decrease. The
    increase in organic business growth was driven by higher demand
    for engineered band clamping systems, partially offset by
    weakness in fire suppression. In 2010, organic sales decreased
    3% domestically and increased 7%



internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the
    U.S. were 56% of total segment sales in 2010 and 55% in
    2009.

Gross profit of $618.5 million in 2010 was
    $96.1 million, or 18%, higher than 2009. As a percent of
    sales, gross profit was 40.9% in 2010, which represented a 160
    basis-point increase from 39.3% in 2009. The increase in gross
    margin primarily reflects higher sales volume, cost reductions
    due to our restructuring initiatives and change in product mix.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses increased to $358.3 million in 2010 from
    $325.5 million in 2009. The $32.8 million increase
    reflects approximately $22.0 million for volume related
    expenses and $10.8 million for incremental costs associated
    with the acquisitions of PPE in April 2010, OBL in July 2010,
    Periflo in September 2010 and Fitzpatrick in November 2010. As a
    percent of net sales, SG&A expenses were 23.7% for 2010 and
    24.5% in 2009.

In 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses
    totaling $11.1 million, while $12.1 million was
    recorded in 2009. These restructuring expenses were mainly
    attributable to employee severance related to employee
    reductions across various functional areas and facility closures
    resulting from the Company’s cost savings initiatives.
    These initiatives included severance benefits for
    215 employees in 2010 and 478 in 2009. The Company has
    completed these employee reductions in 2010 and expects
    severance payments to be fully paid by the end of 2011 using
    cash from operations.

Operating income increased $64.3 million, or 35%, to
    $249.1 million in 2010 from $184.9 million in 2009.
    This increase primarily reflects an increase in volume, changes
    in product mix and cost reductions due to our restructuring
    initiatives. Operating margins in 2010 were 16.5% of sales
    compared with 13.9% recorded in 2009.

In the Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment,
    operating income of $131.9 million and operating margins of
    18.1% in 2010 were up from the $100.3 million and 15.6%
    recorded in 2009, principally due to higher sales and cost
    reduction initiatives. In the Health & Science
    Technologies Segment, operating income of $82.3 million and
    operating margins of 20.7% in 2010 were up from the
    $51.7 million and 17.0% recorded in 2009 due to higher
    volume and cost reduction initiatives. In the Dispensing
    Equipment Segment, operating income of $19.5 million and
    operating margins of 15.6% in 2010 were up from the
    $15.1 million and 11.9% recorded in 2009 due to cost
    reduction initiatives and improved productivity. Operating
    income and operating margins in the Fire &

Safety/Diversified

Products Segment of $62.8 million and 23.7%, respectively,
    were higher than the $59.9 million and 22.8% recorded in
    2009, due to higher volume and favorable mix.

Other expense was $1.1 million in 2010 compared with a
    $1.2 million gain in 2009, due to unfavorable foreign
    currency translation.

Interest expense decreased to $16.2 million in 2010 from
    $17.2 million in 2009. The decrease was principally due to
    lower debt levels and a lower interest rate environment.

The provision for income taxes increased to $74.8 million
    in 2010 from $55.4 million in 2009. The effective tax rate
    decreased to 32.2% in 2010 from 32.8% in 2009, due to changes in
    the mix of global pre-tax income among taxing jurisdictions.

Net income for 2010 was $157.1 million, 39% higher than the
    $113.4 million earned in 2009. Diluted earnings per share
    in 2010 of $1.90 increased $0.50, or 36%, compared with last
    year.

Performance
    in 2009 Compared with 2008

Sales in 2009 of $1,329.7 million were 11% lower than the
    $1,489.5 million recorded in 2008. This decrease reflects a
    14% decrease in organic sales and 2% unfavorable foreign
    currency translation, partially offset by a 5% increase from
    five acquisitions (Richter — October 2008,
    iPEK — October 2008, IETG — October 2008,
    Semrock — October 2008 and Innovadyne —
    November 2008). Organic sales decreased in all four of the
    Company’s reportable segments. Domestic organic sales were
    down 13% versus the prior year, while international organic
    sales were down 15% in 2009. Sales to customers outside the
    U.S. represented 47% of total sales in both 2009 and 2008.

In 2009, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 48%
    of sales and 44% of operating income; Health & Science
    Technologies accounted for 23% of both sales and operating
    income; Dispensing Equipment accounted for 9% of sales and 7% of
    operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified
    Products represented 20% of sales and 26% of operating income.

Fluid & Metering Technologies sales of
    $641.1 million in 2009 decreased $56.6 million, or 8%,
    compared with 2008. This reflects a 16% decline in organic sales
    and 1% of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially
    offset by a 9% increase for acquisitions (Richter, iPEK and
    IETG). The decrease in organic growth was driven by weakness in
    chemical, energy, water and wastewater markets. In 2009, organic
    sales declined approximately 16% both domestically and
    internationally. Organic sales to customers outside the
    U.S. were approximately 41% of total segment sales in 2009
    and 43% in 2008.

Health & Science Technologies sales of
    $304.3 million decreased $27.3 million, or 8%, in 2009
    compared with 2008. This change represents a 12% decrease in
    organic volume and 1% unfavorable foreign currency translation,
    partially offset by a 5% increase from the acquisitions of
    Semrock and Innovadyne. The decrease in organic sales reflected
    market softness across the Health & Science
    Technologies businesses. In 2009, organic sales decreased 13%
    domestically and 10% internationally. Organic sales to customers
    outside the U.S. were approximately 40% of total segment
    sales in 2009 and 38% in 2008.

Dispensing Equipment sales of $127.3 million decreased
    $36.6 million, or 22%, in 2009 compared with the prior
    year. Organic sales decreased 18%, while foreign currency
    translation accounted for 4% of the decrease. The decrease in
    organic growth was due to continued deterioration in capital
    spending in the European and North American markets.
    Organic domestic sales increased 8% compared with 2008, while
    organic international sales decreased 27%. Organic sales to
    customers outside the U.S. were 66% of total segment sales
    in 2009, down from 73% in 2008.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products sales of
    $262.8 million decreased $37.7 million, or 13%, in
    2009 compared with 2008. Organic sales activity decreased 9%,
    while foreign currency translation accounted for 4% of the
    decrease. The decrease in organic business growth was driven by
    lower demand for engineered band clamping systems and lower
    levels of municipal spending. In 2009, organic sales decreased
    12% domestically and 7% internationally. Organic sales to
    customers outside the U.S. were 55% of total segment sales
    in 2009 and 53% in 2008.

Gross profit of $522.4 million in 2009 was
    $75.0 million, or 13%, lower than 2008. As a percent of
    sales, gross profit was 39.3% in 2009, which represented an 80
    basis-point decrease from 40.1% in 2008. The decrease in gross
    margin primarily reflects lower volume and product mix.

SG&A expenses decreased to $325.5 million in 2009 from
    $343.4 million in 2008. The $17.9 million decrease
    reflects approximately $40.7 million for restructuring
    related savings and volume related expenses, partially offset by
    a $22.8 million increase for incremental costs associated
    with recently acquired businesses. As a percent of net sales,
    SG&A expenses were 24.5% for 2009 and 23.1% in 2008.

In 2008, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
    $30.1 million. The Company concluded in accordance with
    ASC 350 that events had occurred and circumstances had
    changed which required the Company to perform an interim period
    goodwill impairment test at Fluid Management, a reporting unit
    in 2008 within the Company’s Dispensing Equipment Segment.
    Fluid Management had experienced a downturn in capital spending
    by its customer base and a loss of market share. The Company
    performed an impairment test and compared the fair



value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. It was
    determined that the fair value of Fluid Management was less than
    the carrying value of the net assets. The excess of the fair
    value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its
    assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.
    The Company’s analysis resulted in an implied fair value of
    goodwill of $21.2 million.

In 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring
    expenses totaling $12.1 million and $18.0 million,
    respectively, for employee severance related to employee
    reductions across various functional areas and facility closures
    resulting from the Company’s cost savings initiatives.
    These initiatives included severance benefits for
    478 employees in 2009 and 380 in 2008.

Operating income decreased $21.1 million, or 10%, to
    $184.9 million in 2009 from $206.0 million in 2008.
    This decrease primarily reflects a decrease in volume, partially
    offset by the goodwill impairment charge in 2008 and the impact
    from acquisitions. Operating margins in 2009 were 13.9% of sales
    compared with 13.8% recorded in 2008.

In the Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment,
    operating income of $100.3 million and operating margins of
    15.6% in 2009 were down from the $123.8 million and 17.7%
    recorded in 2008 principally due to lower sales. In the
    Health & Science Technologies Segment, operating
    income of $51.7 million and operating margins of 17.0% in
    2009 were down from the $58.3 million and 17.6% recorded in
    2008 due to lower volume. In the Dispensing Equipment Segment,
    operating income of $15.1 million and operating margins of
    11.9% in 2009 were up from the $10.7 million of operating
    loss recorded in 2008, due to a goodwill impairment charge in
    2008, partially offset by continued deterioration in the North
    American and European markets. Operating income and operating
    margins in the Fire & Safety/Diversified Products
    Segment of $59.9 million and 22.8%, respectively, were
    lower than the $74.3 million and 24.7% recorded in 2008,
    due primarily to lower volume and unfavorable product mix.

Other income of $1.2 million in 2009 was $3.9 million
    lower than the $5.1 million in 2008, due to unfavorable
    foreign currency translation and lower interest income.

Interest expense decreased to $17.2 million in 2009 from
    $18.9 million in 2008. The decrease was due to a lower
    interest rate environment, the replacement of
    $150.0 million of debt with a lower interest rate borrowing
    in February 2008 and the conversion of $350.0 million
    floating-rate debt into fixed-rates.

The provision for income taxes decreased to $55.4 million
    in 2009 from $65.2 million in 2008. The effective tax rate
    decreased to 32.8% in 2009 from 33.9% in 2008, due to changes in
    the mix of global pre-tax income among taxing jurisdictions.

Net income for 2009 was $113.4 million, 11% lower than the
    $127.0 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share in 2009
    of $1.40 decreased $0.13, or 8%, compared with 2008.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

At December 31, 2010, working capital was
    $339.1 million and the Company’s current ratio was 2.0
    to 1. Cash flows from operating activities decreased
    $28.1 million, or 13%, to $184.5 million in 2010,
    primarily due to the settlement of the forward starting interest
    rate contract entered into during 2010 in connection with the
    $300.0 million 4.5% Senior Notes issued in December
    2010.

Cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund
    capital expenditures of $32.8 million and
    $25.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital
    expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that
    improved productivity and tooling to support the global sourcing
    initiatives, although a portion was for business system
    technology and replacement of equipment and facilities.
    Management believes that the Company has ample capacity in its
    plants and equipment to meet expected needs for future growth in
    the intermediate term.

The Company acquired PPE in April 2010 for cash consideration of
    $51.3 million and the assumption of approximately
    $2.7 million in debt related items, OBL in July 2010 for
    cash consideration of $15.4 million, Periflo in September
    2010 for cash consideration of $4.3 million and Fitzpatrick
    in November 2010 for cash consideration of $20.3 million
    and the assumption of approximately $0.4 million in debt
    related items. The cash payment for PPE was financed with
    borrowings under the Company’s credit facility, while the
    other acquisitions were paid with cash from operations.



The Company maintains a $600.0 million unsecured domestic,
    multi-currency bank revolving credit facility (“Credit
    Facility”), which expires on December 21, 2011. At
    December 31, 2010, there was $27.8 million outstanding
    under the Credit Facility. The net available borrowing under the
    Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010, was approximately
    $572.2 million. Interest is payable quarterly on the
    outstanding borrowings at the bank agent’s reference rate.
    Interest on borrowings based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin
    is payable on the maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly
    from the effective date for borrowings exceeding three months.
    The applicable margin is based on the Company’s senior,
    unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from
    24 basis points to 50 basis points. Based on the
    Company’s credit rating at December 31, 2010, the
    applicable margin was 40 basis points. An annual Credit
    Facility fee, also based on the Company’s credit rating, is
    currently 10 basis points and is payable quarterly.

On April 18, 2008, the Company completed a
    $100.0 million unsecured senior bank term loan agreement
    (“Term Loan”), with covenants consistent with the
    existing Credit Facility and a maturity on December 21,
    2011. At December 31, 2010, there was $90.0 million
    outstanding under the Term Loan included within short term
    borrowings. Interest under the Term Loan is based on the bank
    agent’s reference rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin
    and is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but
    at least quarterly. The applicable margin is based on the
    Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can
    range from 45 to 100 basis points. Based on the
    Company’s current debt rating, the applicable margin is
    80 basis points. The Term Loan requires a repayment of
    $7.5 million in April 2011, with the remaining balance due
    on December 21, 2011. The Company currently maintains an
    interest rate exchange agreement related to the Term Loan which
    expires in December 2011. This interest rate exchange agreement
    has a current notional amount of $90.0 million, the
    agreement effectively converted the $100.0 million of
    floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt at an interest rate of
    4.00%. The fixed rate is comprised of the fixed rate on the
    interest rate exchange agreement and the Company’s current
    margin of 80 basis points on the Term Loan.

On June 9, 2010, the Company completed a private placement
    of €81.0 million ($96.8 million) aggregate
    principal amount of 2.58% Series 2010 Senior Euro Notes due
    June 9, 2015 (“2.58% Senior Euro Notes”)
    pursuant to a Master Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 9,
    2010 (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase
    Agreement provides for the issuance of additional series of
    notes in the future. The 2.58% Senior Euro Notes bear
    interest at a rate of 2.58% per annum and will mature on
    June 9, 2015. The 2.58% Senior Euro Notes are
    unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in
    right of payment with all of the Company’s other senior
    debt. The Company may at any time prepay all or any portion of
    the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes; provided that such portion is
    greater than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
    outstanding under the Purchase Agreement. In the event of a
    prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus
    accrued interest plus a make-whole premium. The Purchase
    Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the
    Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell
    assets, create liens and engage in certain mergers or
    consolidations. In addition, the Company must comply with a
    leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as set forth in the
    Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides for
    customary events of default. In the case of an event of default
    arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all
    outstanding 2.58% Senior Euro Notes will become due and
    payable immediately without further action or notice. In the
    case of payment events of defaults, any holder of the
    2.58% Senior Euro Notes affected thereby may declare all
    the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes held by it due and payable
    immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a
    majority of the holders of the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes may
    declare all the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes to be due and
    payable immediately. The Company used a portion of the proceeds
    from the private placement to pay down existing debt outstanding
    under the Credit Facility that had previously been denominated
    in Euros, with the remainder being available for ongoing
    business activities.

On December 6, 2010, the Company completed a public
    offering of $300.0 million 4.5% Notes due
    December 15, 2020 (“4.5% Senior Notes”). The
    net proceeds from the offering of approximately
    $295.7 million, after deducting the $1.6 million
    issuance discount, the $1.9 million underwriting commission
    and estimated offering expenses of approximately
    $0.8 million, was used to repay $250.0 million of
    outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility. The balance
    of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
    The 4.5% Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.5%
    per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears each June
    15 and December 15, beginning June 15, 2011. The
    Company may redeem all or part of the 4.5% Senior Notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in
    the Note Indenture (“Indenture”) governing the



4.5% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt
    from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and
    4.5% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the
    Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain
    liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback
    transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers,
    conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the
    Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.5% Senior Notes
    also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase
    4.5% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event
    (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any.

On April 15, 2010, the Company entered into a forward
    starting interest rate contract with a notional amount of
    $300.0 million with a settlement date in December 2010.
    This contract was entered into in anticipation of the issuance
    of the $300.0 million 4.5% Senior Notes and was
    designed to lock in the market interest rate as of
    April 15, 2010. The Company settled this interest rate
    contract in December 2010, resulting in a $31.0 million
    payment. The $31.0 million will be amortized into interest
    expense over the 10 year term of the 4.5% Senior Notes
    yielding an effective interest rate of 5.8%.

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is
    required to maintain in connection with the Credit Facility,
    Term Loan, and 2.58% Senior Euro Notes. There are no
    financial covenants relating to the 4.5% Senior Notes. The
    most restrictive financial covenants under these debt
    instruments require a minimum interest coverage ratio (operating
    cash flow to interest) of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio
    (outstanding debt to operating cash flow) of 3.25 to 1. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with both
    of these financial covenants. The Company expects to be in
    compliance with both of these key financial covenants throughout
    2011.

On April 21, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $125.0 million of its
    outstanding common shares. Repurchases under the new program
    will be funded with cash flow generation, and made from time to
    time in either the open market or through private transactions.
    The timing, volume, and nature of share repurchases will be at
    the discretion of management, dependent on market conditions,
    other priorities for cash investment, applicable securities
    laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at
    any time. No shares were purchased in 2010 or 2009.

We expect our current cash and cash that will be generated from
    operations during 2011 will be sufficient to meet our operating
    cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest on all
    borrowings, required debt repayments, pension and postretirement
    funding requirements and annual dividend payments to holders of
    the Company’s stock during the next twelve months.
    Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are
    available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, we may obtain
    all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through
    the incurrence of additional borrowings. Our current intention,
    if the available terms and conditions are acceptable, is to
    enter into a new revolving credit facility agreement during 2011
    since the existing Credit Facility matures on December 21,
    2011. As of December 31, 2010, $27.8 million is
    outstanding under the existing Credit Facility and
    $90.0 million is outstanding under the Term Loan and both
    are classified as short term borrowings on the Balance Sheet. We
    expect our cash and cash from operations to be adequate to repay
    these balances during 2011.

Contractual
    Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include
    pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, rental
    payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases,
    and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary course
    of business. There are no identifiable events or uncertainties,
    including the lowering of our credit rating that would
    accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or
    obligations.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual
    obligations and commercial commitments at December 31,
    2010, and the future periods in which such obligations are
    expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects
    the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding
    borrowings. Additional detail



regarding these obligations is provided in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

We believe that the application of the following accounting
    policies, which are important to our financial position and
    results of operations, requires significant judgments and
    estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of our
    accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed
    below, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Part II. Item 8. “Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data”.

Revenue recognition

— The Company recognizes
    revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
    delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable,
    and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. For
    product sales, delivery does not occur until the products have
    been shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the
    customer. Revenue from services is recognized when the services
    are provided or ratably over the contract term. Some
    arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables,
    including the combination of products and services. In such
    cases, the Company has identified these as separate elements in
    accordance with

ASC 985-65-25

“Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element
    Arrangements-Recognition” and recognizes revenue consistent
    with the policy for each separate element based on the fair
    value of each accounting unit. Revenues from certain long-term
    contracts are recognized on the

percentage-of-completion

method.

Percentage-of-completion

is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to
    date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such
    contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on
    uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which
    such losses are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the
    estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion
    costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions
    and final contract settlements, will be revised in the
    near-term. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in
    the period in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns
    and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of
    revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on
    historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers
    product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for
    warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the
    warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related
    information known to the Company.



Share-based compensation

— The Company accounts
    for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value
    recognition and measurement provisions of ASC Topic 718
    “Compensation — Stock Compensation” and
    applies the Binomial lattice option-pricing model to determine
    the fair value of options. The Binomial lattice option-pricing
    model incorporates certain assumptions, such as the expected
    volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield,
    expected forfeiture rate and expected life of options, in order
    to arrive at a fair value estimate. As a result, share-based
    compensation expense, as calculated and recorded under
    ASC 718 could have been impacted if other assumptions were
    used. Furthermore, if the Company used different assumptions in
    future periods, share-based compensation expense could be
    impacted in future periods. See Note 13 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8.
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for
    additional information.

Inventory

— The Company states inventories at
    the lower of cost or market. Cost, which includes material,
    labor, and factory overhead, is determined on a FIFO basis. We
    make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net
    realizable value, if required, for estimated excess,
    obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these
    adjustments include changes in market demand, product life cycle
    and engineering changes.

Goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets

—
    The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent
    assets utilizing various estimation processes. An impairment of
    a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount
    exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount
    is not recoverable through future operations. An intangible
    asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of
    intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value.
    Assessments of possible impairments of goodwill, long-lived or
    intangible assets are made when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may
    not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally,
    testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible asset balances is performed
    annually. The amount and timing of impairment charges for these
    assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair
    value of the related assets.

The Company’s business acquisitions result in recording
    goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the
    Company will incur in future periods. The Company follows the
    guidance prescribed in ASC 350, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” to test goodwill and intangible assets
    for impairment. Annually, on October 31 or more frequently if
    triggering events occur, the Company compares the fair value of
    their reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting
    unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists.

The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit
    utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted
    50% and a market approach consisting of a comparable public
    company EBITDA multiples methodology weighted 50%. To determine
    the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the Company
    reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income
    approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different
    valuations.

The key assumptions are updated each year for each reporting
    unit for the income and market methodology used to determine
    fair value. Various assumptions are utilized including
    forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic
    plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the
    weighted average cost of capital, comparable transactions,
    market data and EBITDA multiples. The assumptions that have the
    most significant effect on the fair value calculation are the
    weighted average cost of capital, the EBITDA multiples and
    terminal growth rates. The 2010 and 2009 ranges for these three
    assumptions utilized by the Company are as follows:

Assumptions:

2010 Range

2009 Range

Weighted average cost of capital

12.1% to 13.9%

11.0% to 13.7%

EBITDA multiples

9.0x to 12.0x

9.0x to 11.0x

Terminal growth rates

3.0% to 3.5%

3.0% to 3.5%

The Company concluded that the fair value of each of its
    reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying
    value as of October 31, 2010, and thus no goodwill
    impairment was identified.

Income taxes

— The Company accounts for income
    taxes in accordance with ASC 740 — “Income
    Taxes”. Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax
    effects



of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The
    Company’s tax balances are based on management’s
    interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous
    taxing jurisdictions. Future tax authority rulings and changes
    in tax laws and future tax planning strategies could affect the
    actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the
    Company.

Contingencies and litigation —

We are currently
    involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings and, as
    required and where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue
    estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these
    matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with
    outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential
    results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement
    strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating
    results for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
    materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the
    effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.

Defined benefit retirement plans —

The plan
    obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement
    plans are presented in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8.
    “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
    Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices
    for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are
    valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for
    similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using
    unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market
    participants would use in pricing the assets. Plan obligations
    and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting with
    actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the Company.
    Key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension
    expense include the discount rate, the rate of salary increases,
    and the estimated future return on plan assets. To the extent
    actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated
    amounts, results could be adversely affected.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued ASU

2010-06,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820).”
    This Update provides amendments to Subtopic

820-10

and
    related guidance within U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles (“GAAP”) to require disclosure of the
    transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 and a schedule for
    Level 3 that separately identifies purchases, sales,
    issuances and settlements and requires more detailed disclosures
    regarding valuation techniques and inputs. The new disclosures
    and clarifications of existing disclosures were effective for
    the Company’s fiscal year 2010, except for the disclosures
    about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll
    forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements,
    which will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year 2011.
    See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for
    disclosures associated with the adoption of this standard that
    were effective in 2010.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13,

“Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) —
    Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” ASU

No. 2009-13

addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements
    to enable vendors to account for products or services
    (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. This
    guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining
    the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on:
    (a) vendor-specific objective evidence;
    (b) third-party evidence; or (c) estimates. This
    guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and
    requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the
    inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the
    relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance
    significantly expands required disclosures related to a
    vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements.

ASU No. 2009-13

is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into
    or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. A company
    may elect, but will not be required, to adopt the amendments in
    ASU

No. 2009-13

retrospectively for all prior periods. Management is currently
    evaluating the requirements of ASU

No. 2009-13

and has not yet determined the impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We may, from
    time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and
    interest rate exchange agreements on our debt when we believe
    there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk
    management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes
    the procedures and controls over derivative financial and
    commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward
    contracts and interest rate exchange agreements. Under the
    policy, we do not use financial or commodity derivative
    instruments for trading purposes, and the use of these
    instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers.
    Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to
    foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange
    agreements on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt. The
    Company’s exposure related to derivative instruments is, in
    the aggregate, not material to its financial position, results
    of operations or cash flows.

The Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is
    limited principally to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound
    and Chinese Renminbi. We manage our foreign exchange risk
    principally through invoicing our customers in the same currency
    as the source of our products. The effect of transaction gains
    and losses is reported within “Other income
    (expense)-net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Business

IDEX is an applied solutions company specializing in fluid and
    metering technologies, health and science technologies,
    dispensing equipment, and fire, safety and other diversified
    products built to its customers’ specifications. Its
    products are sold in niche markets to a wide range of industries
    throughout the world. The Company’s products include
    industrial pumps, compressors, flow meters, injectors and
    valves, and related controls for use in a wide variety of
    process applications; precision fluidics solutions, including
    pumps, valves, degassing equipment, corrective tubing, fittings,
    and complex manifolds, as well as specialty medical equipment
    and devices used in life science applications;
    precision-engineered equipment for dispensing, metering and
    mixing paints; refinishing equipment; and engineered products
    for industrial and commercial markets, including fire and
    rescue, transportation equipment, oil and gas, electronics, and
    communications. These activities are grouped into four
    reportable segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies,
    Health & Science Technologies, Dispensing Equipment,
    and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and
    its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts
    have been eliminated.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported
    amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal
    areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are
    revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, allowance for
    doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, recoverability of
    long-lived assets, income taxes, product warranties,
    derivatives, contingencies and litigation, insurance-related
    items, share-based compensation and defined benefit retirement
    plans.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
    fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is
    reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur
    until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been
    transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized
    when the services are provided or ratably over the contract
    term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple
    deliverables, including the combination of products and
    services. In such cases the Company has identified these as
    separate elements in accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 985 and recognizes revenue
    consistent with the policy for each separate element based on
    the fair value of each accounting unit. Revenues from certain
    long-term contracts are recognized on the

percentage-of-completion

method.

Percentage-of-completion

is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to
    date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such
    contract at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on
    uncompleted long-term contracts are made in the period in which
    such losses are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the
    estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion
    costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions
    and final contract settlements, will be revised in the
    near-term. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in
    the period in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns
    and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of
    revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on
    historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers
    product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for
    warranty claims at the time of



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty
    costs incurred and any other related information known to the
    Company.

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales and
    are recognized as a period expense during the period in which
    they are incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs of $11.0 million, $11.4 million and
    $11.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively are expensed as incurred.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
    purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to
    be cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories

The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or market.
    Cost, which includes material, labor, and factory overhead, is
    determined on a FIFO basis. We make adjustments to reduce the
    cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, at
    the business unit level for estimated excess, obsolescence or
    impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include
    changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering
    changes.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the
    occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate
    that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, as
    measured by comparing their net book value to the projected
    undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired
    assets are recorded at their estimated fair value using a
    discounted cash flow analysis.

Goodwill
    and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets annually on October 31,
    or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances
    that indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or
    intangible assets may not be recoverable, in accordance with
    ASC 350. The Company evaluates the recoverability of each
    of these assets based on the estimated fair value of each of the
    thirteen reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible asset.
    See Note 4 for a further discussion on goodwill and
    intangible assets.

Borrowing
    Expenses

Expenses, inclusive of commissions and professional fees,
    incurred in securing and issuing debt are amortized over the
    life of the related borrowing and are included in Interest
    expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Earnings
    per Common Share

Earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by
    dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of
    common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents and unvested
    shares (diluted) outstanding during the year. Common stock
    equivalents consist of stock options and deferred compensation
    units (“DCUs”) and have been included in the
    calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the
    treasury stock method.



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ASC 260 concludes that all outstanding unvested share-based
    payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends
    participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders.
    If awards are considered participating securities, the Company
    is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and
    diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its
    outstanding unvested shares are participating securities.
    Accordingly, earnings per common share were computed using the
    two-class method prescribed by ASC 260. Net income
    attributable to common shareholders was reduced by
    $1.4 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Basic weighted average shares outstanding reconciles to diluted
    weighted average shares outstanding as follows:

Options to purchase approximately 0.2 million,
    2.2 million and 3.3 million shares of common stock as
    of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were not
    included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise
    price was greater than the average market price of the
    Company’s common stock and, therefore, the effect of their
    inclusion would have been antidilutive.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
    ASC 718. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value
    of awards made under its share-based compensation plans. That
    cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over
    the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 13 for
    further discussion on share-based compensation.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
    amortization provided using the straight-line method over the
    following estimated useful lives:

Land improvements

8 to 12 years

Buildings and improvements

8 to 30 years

Machinery & equipment and engineering drawings

3 to 12 years

Office and transportation equipment

3 to 10 years

Certain identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their
    estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The
    estimated useful lives used in the computation of amortization
    of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:

Patents

5 to 17 years

Trade names

3 to 20 years

Customer relationships

3 to 20 years

Non-compete agreements

2 to 5 years

Unpatented technology and other

4 to 20 years



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Research
    and Development Expenditures

Costs associated with research and development are expensed in
    the period incurred and are included in “Cost of
    sales” within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
    Research and development expenses, which include costs
    associated with developing new products and major improvements
    to existing products were $31.8 million, $29.6 million
    and $29.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of substantially all operations outside
    the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly,
    those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been
    translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance
    sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using
    the average exchange rate for the year. The gains and losses
    resulting from changes in exchange rates from year to year have
    been reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss)” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effect of
    transaction gains and losses is reported within “Other
    income (expense)-net” on the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense includes United States, state, local and
    international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing
    assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards. The tax rate
    used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the
    enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are
    recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will
    more likely than not be realized.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company is not dependent on a single customer, the largest
    of which accounted for less than 2% of net sales for all years
    presented.

Recently
    Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU

2010-06,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820).”
    This Update provides amendments to Subtopic

820-10

and
    related guidance within GAAP to require disclosure of the

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-13,

“Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) —
    Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” ASU

No. 2009-13

addresses the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements
    to enable vendors to account for products or services
    (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. This
    guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining
    the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on:
    (a) vendor-specific objective evidence;
    (b) third-party evidence; or (c) estimates. This
    guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and
    requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the
    inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the
    relative selling price method. In addition, this guidance
    significantly expands required disclosures related to a
    vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU

No. 2009-13

is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into
    or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
    June 15, 2010 and early adoption is permitted. A company
    may elect, but will not be required,

Restructuring

The Company has recorded restructuring expenses as a result of
    cost reduction efforts and facility closings. Accruals have been
    recorded based on these costs and primarily consist of employee
    termination benefits. We record expenses for employee
    termination benefits based on the guidance of ASC 420,
    “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” These expenses
    are included in Restructuring expenses in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations while the related restructuring
    accruals are included in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    recorded an additional $11.1 million of pre-tax
    restructuring expenses related to our 2009 restructuring
    initiative for employee severance related to employee reductions
    across various functional areas as well as facility closures
    resulting from the Company’s cost savings initiatives. In
    2009, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses
    totaling $12.1 million related to this same initiative. The
    2009 initiative included severance benefits for approximately
    700 employees.

value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill
    represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount
    assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite
    lives were tested for impairment as of October 31, 2010,
    the Company’s annual impairment assessment date. In 2010,
    there were no triggering events or change in circumstances that
    would have required a review other than as of our annual test
    date. The Company concluded that the fair value of each of the
    reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets was in

The Company maintains a $600.0 million unsecured domestic,
    multi-currency bank revolving credit facility (“Credit
    Facility”), which expires on December 21, 2011. In
    2008, the Credit Facility was amended to allow the



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company to designate certain foreign subsidiaries as designated
    borrowers. Upon approval from the lenders, the designated
    borrowers were allowed to receive loans under the Credit
    Facility. A designated borrower sublimit was established as the
    lesser of the aggregate commitments or $100.0 million. As
    of the amendment date, Fluid Management Europe B.V.,
    (“FME”) was approved by the lenders as a designated
    borrower. On March 16, 2010, IDEX UK Ltd. (“IDEX
    UK”) was also approved by the lenders as a designated
    borrower which allowed them to receive loans under the Credit
    Facility. FME had no borrowings under the Credit Facility as of
    December 31, 2010, while $48.7 million was outstanding
    as of December 31,2009. This balance was repaid with
    proceeds from the €81.0 million 2.58% Senior Euro
    Notes. IDEX UK’s borrowings included within short term
    borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2010
    were £18.0 million ($27.8 million). As the IDEX
    UK’s borrowings under the Credit Facility are British Pound
    denominated and the cash flows that will be used to make
    payments of principal and interest are predominately generated
    in British Pound, the Company does not anticipate any
    significant foreign exchange gains or losses in servicing this
    debt.

At December 31, 2010 there was $27.8 million
    outstanding under the Credit Facility. The net available
    borrowing under the Credit Facility as of December 31,
    2010, was approximately $572.2 million. Interest is payable
    quarterly on the outstanding borrowings at the bank agent’s
    reference rate. Interest on borrowings, based on LIBOR plus an
    applicable margin, is payable on the maturity date of the
    borrowing, or quarterly from the effective date for borrowings
    exceeding three months. The applicable margin is based on the
    Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can
    range from 24 basis points to 50 basis points. Based
    on the Company’s credit rating at December 31, 2010,
    the applicable margin was 40 basis points. An annual Credit
    Facility fee, also based on the Company’s credit rating, is
    currently 10 basis points and is payable quarterly.

On April 18, 2008, the Company completed a
    $100.0 million unsecured senior bank term loan agreement
    (“Term Loan”), with covenants consistent with the
    existing Credit Facility and a maturity on December 21,
    2011. At December 31, 2010, there was $90.0 million
    outstanding under the Term Loan included within short term
    borrowings. Interest under the Term Loan is based on the bank
    agent’s reference rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin
    and is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but
    at least quarterly. The applicable margin is based on the
    Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can
    range from 45 to 100 basis points. Based on the
    Company’s current debt rating, the applicable margin is
    80 basis points. The Term Loan requires a repayment of
    $7.5 million in April 2011, with the remaining balance due
    on December 21, 2011. The Company currently maintains an
    interest rate exchange agreement related to the Term Loan which
    expires in December 2011. This interest rate exchange agreement
    has a current notional amount of $90.0 million, the
    agreement effectively converted $100.0 million of
    floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt at an interest rate of
    4.00%. The fixed rate is comprised of the fixed rate on the
    interest rate exchange agreement and the Company’s current
    margin of 80 basis points on the Term Loan.

On June 9, 2010, the Company completed a private placement
    of €81.0 million ($96.8 million) aggregate
    principal amount of 2.58% Series 2010 Senior Euro Notes due
    June 9, 2015 (“2.58% Senior Euro Notes”)
    pursuant to a Master Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 9,
    2010 (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase
    Agreement provides for the issuance of additional series of
    notes in the future. The 2.58% Senior Euro Notes bear
    interest at a rate of 2.58% per annum and will mature on
    June 9, 2015. The 2.58% Senior Euro Notes are
    unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in
    right of payment with all of the Company’s other senior
    debt. The Company may at any time prepay all or any portion of
    the 2.58% Senior Euro Notes; provided that such portion is
    greater than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
    outstanding under the Purchase Agreement. In the event of a
    prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus
    accrued interest plus a make-whole premium. The Purchase
    Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the
    Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell
    assets, create liens and engage in certain mergers or
    consolidations. In addition, the Company must comply with a
    leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as set forth in the
    Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement provides for
    customary events of default. In the case of an event of default
    arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all
    outstanding 2.58% Senior Euro Notes will become due and
    payable immediately without further action or notice. In the
    case of payment events of defaults, any holder of the
    2.58% Senior Euro



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Notes affected thereby may declare all the 2.58% Senior
    Euro Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case
    of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the
    2.58% Senior Euro Notes may declare all the
    2.58% Senior Euro Notes to be due and payable immediately.
    The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the private
    placement to pay down existing debt outstanding under the Credit
    Facility that had previously been denominated in Euros, with the
    remainder being available for ongoing business activities.

On December 6, 2010, the Company completed a public
    offering of $300.0 million 4.5% Notes due
    December 15, 2020 (“4.5% Senior Notes”). The
    net proceeds from the offering of approximately
    $295.7 million, after deducting the $1.6 million
    issuance discount, the $1.9 million underwriting commission
    and estimated offering expenses of approximately
    $0.8 million, was used to repay $250.0 million of
    outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility. The balance
    of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
    The 4.5% Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate of 4.5%
    per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears each June
    15 and December 15, beginning June 15, 2011. The
    Company may redeem all or part of the 4.5% Senior Notes at
    any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in
    the Note Indenture (“Indenture”) governing the
    4.5% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt
    from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and
    4.5% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the
    Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain
    liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback
    transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers,
    conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the
    Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.5% Senior Notes
    also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase
    4.5% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event
    (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any.

On April 15, 2010, the Company entered into a forward
    starting interest rate contract with a notional amount of
    $300.0 million with a settlement date in December 2010.
    This contract was entered into in anticipation of the issuance
    of the $300.0 million 4.5% Senior Notes and was
    designed to lock in the market interest rate as of
    April 15, 2010. The Company settled this interest rate
    contract in December 2010, resulting in a $31.0 million
    payment. The $31.0 million will be amortized into interest
    expense over the 10 year term of the 4.5% Senior Notes
    yielding an effective interest rate of 5.8%.

Other borrowings of $4.3 million at December 31, 2010
    was comprised of capital leases as well as debt at international
    locations maintained for working capital purposes. Interest is
    payable on the outstanding debt balances at the international
    locations at rates ranging from 1.0% to 7.28% per annum.

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is
    required to maintain in connection with the Credit Facility,
    Term Loan, and 2.58% Senior Euro Notes. There are no
    financial covenants relating to the 4.5% Senior Notes. The
    most restrictive financial covenants under these debt
    instruments require a minimum interest coverage ratio (operating
    cash flow to interest) of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio
    (outstanding debt to operating cash flow) of 3.25 to 1. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with both
    of these financial covenants.

Derivative

The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure
    to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The type
    of cash flow hedges the Company enters into includes foreign
    currency contracts and interest rate exchange agreements that
    effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to
    fixed-rate debt and are designed to reduce the impact of
    interest rate changes on future interest expense.

The effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate
    exchange agreements is reported in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and
    reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in
    which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining
    gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present
    value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is
    recognized into net income during the period of change.

Fair values relating to derivative financial instruments reflect
    the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
    sell or buy the contracts based on quoted market prices of
    comparable contracts at each balance sheet date.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had one interest rate
    exchange agreement. The interest rate exchange agreement,
    expiring in December 2011, with a current notional amount of
    $90.0 million, effectively converted $100.0 million of
    floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt at an interest rate of
    4.00%. The fixed rate consists of the fixed rate on the interest
    rate exchange agreements and the Company’s current margin
    of 80 basis points on the Term Loan.

Expiring in January 2011, the interest rate exchange agreement
    related to the Credit Facility was settled in December 2010. The
    interest rate exchange agreement effectively converted
    $250.0 million of floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt
    at an interest rate of 3.25%.

Based on interest rates at December 31, 2010, approximately
    $5.9 million of the amount included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity at
    December 31, 2010 will be recognized to net income over the
    next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions are
    realized. The $5.9 million is comprised of
    $2.3 million from the interest rate exchange agreement and
    $3.6 million from the forward starting interest rate
    contract.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had foreign currency
    exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of
    $2.5 million to manage its exposure to fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates. The change in fair market value
    of these contracts for the twelve months ended December 31,
    2010 was immaterial.

Fair
    Value Measurements

ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
    defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value
    and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses
    valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
    market prices), the income approach (present value of future
    income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the
    service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard
    utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
    valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
    levels. The following is a brief description of those three
    levels:

•

Level 1:

Observable inputs such as quoted
    prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities.

•

Level 2:

Inputs, other than quoted prices
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or
    similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that reflect
    the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

The following table summarizes the basis used to measure the
    Company’s financial assets (liabilities) at fair value on a
    recurring basis in the balance sheet at December 31, 2010
    and 2009:

The carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates
    their fair values because of the short term nature of these
    instruments. At December 31, 2010, the fair value of our

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 we had approximately $0.8 million,
    $0.9 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of
    accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. As of
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 we had approximately
    $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million,
    respectively, of accrued penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect
    our effective tax rate if recognized is $5.8 million,
    $4.4 million and $3.1 million as of December 31,
    2010, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008,
    respectively. The tax years

2005-2009

remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to
    the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign
    examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of
    limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s
    gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the
    next twelve months by a range of zero to $1.6 million.

The Company had loss carry forwards for U.S. federal and

non-U.S. purposes

at December 31, 2010 of $3.5 and $13.7 million
    respectively, and as of December 31, 2009,
    $2.2 million and $12.5 million, respectively. The
    federal loss carry forwards are available for use against the
    Company’s consolidated federal taxable income and expire
    between 2023 and 2030. The entire balance of the

non-U.S. losses

is available to be carried forward, with $9.5 million of
    these losses beginning to expire during the years 2012 through
    2019. The remaining $4.2 million of such losses can be
    carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the Company had a foreign capital loss carry forward of
    approximately $1.3 million and $2.3 million
    respectively. The foreign capital loss can be carried forward
    indefinitely. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
    has a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset
    attributable to the foreign capital loss of $0.4 million
    and $0.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company had state net operating loss carry
    forwards of approximately $18.7 million and
    $12.7 million, respectively. If unutilized, the state net
    operating loss will expire between 2016 and 2029. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded a
    valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset attributable
    to the state net operating loss of $0.4 million and
    $0.2 million, respectively.

The purchase price for 2010 acquisitions has been allocated to
    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated
    fair values at the date of the acquisition. For certain
    acquisitions that occurred in 2010, the Company is in the
    process of obtaining or finalizing appraisals of tangible and
    intangible assets and it is continuing to evaluate the initial
    purchase price allocations, as of the acquisition date, which
    will be adjusted as additional information relative to the fair
    values of the assets and liabilities of the businesses become
    known. Accordingly, management has used their best estimate in

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company maintains two share-based compensation plans for
    executives, non-employee directors, and certain key employees
    which authorize the granting of stock options, unvested shares,
    unvested share units, and other types of awards consistent with
    the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for
    issuance under the Company’s plans as of December 31,
    2010 totals 10.6 million, of which 4.3 million shares
    were available for future issuance. Stock options granted under
    these plans are generally non-qualified, and are granted with an
    exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s
    stock at the date of grant. Substantially all of the options
    issued to employees prior to 2005 become exercisable in five
    equal installments, while the majority of options issued to
    employees in 2005 and after become exercisable in four equal
    installments, beginning one year from the date of grant, and
    generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Stock
    options granted to non-employee directors cliff vest after one
    or two years. Unvested share and unvested share unit awards
    generally cliff vest after three or four years for employees,
    and three years for non-employee directors. The Company issued
    264,915, 273,000 and 583,000 of unvested shares as compensation
    to key employees in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of the
    shares granted in 2008, 242,800 of the shares vest 50% on
    April 8, 2011 and 50% on April 8, 2013, but such
    vesting may be accelerated if the Company’s share price for
    any five consecutive trading days equals or exceeds $65.90
    (twice the closing price of the shares on the date of grant).

All unvested shares carry dividend and voting rights, and the
    sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
    ASC 718. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value
    of awards made under its share-based plans. That cost is
    recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the
    requisite service period of the grants.

Weighted average option fair values and assumptions for the
    period specified are disclosed in the following table:

The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share
    price performance over the contractual term of the option.

•

The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life
    of the option. The expected life assumption for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is an output of the
    Binomial lattice option-pricing model, which incorporates
    vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of
    post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option
    to define expected employee behavior.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within
    the contractual life of the option. For the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we present the range of
    risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the
    U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice
    option-pricing model.

•

The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s
    current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected
    dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the
    option.

The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award. Additionally, the Company’s general policy is
    to issue new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option
    exercises or grants of unvested shares.

    capitalized as part of inventory was immaterial.

As of December 31, 2010, there was $10.3 million of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options
    that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
    of 1.3 years. As of December 31, 2010, there was
    $9.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
    related to unvested shares that is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of 1.0 years.

The discount rates for our plans are derived by matching the
    plan’s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the
    equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The
    discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same
    present value of cash flows.

In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the
    Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on
    plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset
    return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the
    plan’s target asset allocation and current market
    conditions.

Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the average remaining service period of active participants.
    Gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit
    obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the
    average remaining service period of active participants. Costs
    of bargaining unit-sponsored multi-employer plans and defined
    contribution plans were $7.2 million, $9.6 million and
    $9.8 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

For measurement purposes, a 7.9% weighted average annual rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
    was assumed for 2010. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually
    each year to a rate of 4.50% for 2028, and remain at that level
    thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
    plans. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates
    would increase the service and interest cost components of the
    net periodic benefit cost by $0.1 million and the health
    care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation by $1.5 million. A 1% decrease in the assumed
    health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and
    interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by
    $0.1 million and the health care component of the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
    $1.3 million.

Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the

    or a registered investment company that are valued using
    significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset
    value (“NAV”) provided by the fund administrator. The
    NAV is based on value of the underlying assets owned by the fund
    minus its liabilities. Fixed income securities that are valued
    using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices
    obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized
    vendors.

Investment
    Policies and Strategies

The investment objectives of the Company’s plan assets are
    to earn the highest possible rate of return consistent with the
    tolerance for risk as determined periodically by the Company in
    its role as a fiduciary. The general guidelines of asset
    allocation of fund assets are that “equities” will
    represent from 55% to 75% of the market value of total fund
    assets with a target of 66%, and “fixed income”
    obligations, including cash, will represent from 25% to 45% with
    a target of 34%. The term “equities” includes common
    stock, convertible bonds and convertible stock. The term
    “fixed income” includes preferred stock

and/or

contractual payments with a specific maturity date. The Company
    strives to maintain asset allocations within the designated
    ranges by conducting periodic reviews of fund allocations and
    plan liquidity needs, and rebalancing the portfolio accordingly.
    The total fund performance is monitored and results measured
    using a 3- to

5-year

moving average against long-term absolute and relative return
    objectives to meet actuarially determined forecasted benefit
    obligations. No restrictions are placed on the selection of
    individual investments by the qualified investment fund
    managers. The performance of the investment fund

managers is reviewed on a regular basis, using appointed
    professional independent advisors. As of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, there were no shares of the Company’s stock held
    in plan assets.

Cash
    Flows

The Company expects to contribute approximately
    $7.9 million to its defined benefit plans and
    $1.0 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in
    2011. The Company also expects to contribute approximately
    $12.3 million to its defined contribution plans in 2011.

Estimated
    Future Benefit Payments

The future estimated benefit payments for the next five years
    and the five years thereafter are as follows: 2011 —

    allocated to goodwill and intangibles assets for both
    acquisitions.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of IDEX Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
    position of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2011,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of IDEX Corporation

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. As described in Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its
    assessment the internal control over financial reporting at
    Precision Polymer Engineering Limited (“PPE”), which
    was acquired on April 15, 2010, OBL, S.r.l.
    (“OBL”), which was acquired on July 21, 2010,
    Periflo, which was acquired on September 17, 2010, and
    Fitzpatrick, Inc. (“Fitzpatrick”), which was acquired
    on November 1, 2010. These exclusions constitute 7.6% and
    5.6% of net and total assets, respectively, 2.7% of net sales,
    and 2.8% of net income of the consolidated financial statement
    amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over
    financial reporting at PPE, OBL, Periflo, and Fitzpatrick. The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“generally accepted accounting principles”).
    A company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, of
    the Company and our report dated February 24, 2011,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process
    designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board
    of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America, and includes
    those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of
    the Company are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of management and directors of the
    Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the
    framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2010.

The Company completed the acquisitions of PPE in April 2010, OBL
    in July 2010, Periflo in September 2010 and Fitzpatrick in
    November 2010. Due to the timing of the acquisitions, management
    has excluded these acquisitions from our evaluation of
    effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.
    This exclusion represented 2.7% of total sales and 2.8% of net
    income as well as 7.6% of net assets and 5.6% of total assets
    for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, has been
    audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

Controls
    and Procedures.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
    are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
    in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b),

the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of the Company’s management,
    including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the
    Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
    the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
    this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
    as of December 31, 2010.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing on page 61 of this report is
    incorporated into this Item 9A by reference.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent
    fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
    likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

    Committees,” in the Company’s 2011 Proxy Statement is
    incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding

    Item 1. of this report under the caption “Executive

The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

    outstanding options, warrants and rights.

(2)

All Deferred Compensation Units (“DCUs”) issued under
    the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Non-officer Presidents are to be issued
    under the Company’s Incentive Award Plan and any DCUs
    remaining in these plans were eliminated by shareholder approval
    on April 8, 2008. DCUs issued under the Deferred
    Compensation Plan for Officers continue to be issued under the
    Incentive Award Plan.

The number of DCUs is determined by dividing the amount deferred
    by the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock the day
    before the date of deferral. The DCUs are entitled to receive
    dividend equivalents which are reinvested in DCUs based on the
    same formula for investment of a participant’s deferral.
    Since deferred compensation is payable upon separation of
    service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal
    Revenue Code, no benefits are payable prior to the date that is
    six months after the date of separation of service, or the date
    of death of the employee, if earlier.

Item 13.

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
    Independence.

No certain relationships exist. Information under the heading
    “Information Regarding the Board of Directors and
