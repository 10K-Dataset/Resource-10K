Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

For an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors present risks to the Company and could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of our operations and the financial results of our operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant of these factors are included below. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks.  These risks are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.

Changes in U.S. or International Economic Conditions Could Materially Adversely Affect the Sales and Profitability of Our Businesses.

In


,

50%

of the Company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while

50%

were derived from international operations. The Company’s largest end markets include industrial, semiconductor, automotive, life sciences and medical technologies, fire and rescue, oil and gas, paint and coatings, chemical processing, agriculture, water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy and, in particular, any of these specific end markets could materially reduce the Company’s sales and profitability.

Change to Geopolitical and Economic Conditions in the U.S. and Foreign Countries in Which We Operate Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

In


, approximately

50%

of our total sales were to customers outside the U.S. We expect our international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Our sales from international operations and our sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks include the following:

•

possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;

•

risks of economic instability;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;

•

potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;

•

disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;

•

withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the United States and other countries;

•

risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;

•

effects of the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union and related potential disruption to trade;

•

changes in tariff and trade barriers, including the recent impact of the first phase of the trade agreement between the United States and China; and

•

geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war.

Any of these events could have a materially adverse impact on our business and operations.

Our Inability to Continue to Develop New Products Could Limit Our Sales Growth.

Our ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to our ability to continue to develop new products. A failure to continue to develop and deliver new, innovative and competitive products to the market could limit our sales growth and negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Our Growth Strategy Includes Acquisitions and We May Not be Able to Make Acquisitions of Suitable Candidates or Integrate Acquisitions Successfully.

Our historical growth has included, and our future growth is likely to continue to include, acquisitions. We intend to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to us.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s



attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted in, and future acquisitions could result in, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses.

The Markets We Serve are Highly Competitive and this Competition Could Reduce our Sales and Operating Margins.

Most of our products are sold in competitive markets. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require us to adjust the prices of our products to stay competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to continue competing successfully could reduce our sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.

We are Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and Components Used in Our Products.

While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, including due to geopolitical unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Significant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm Our Financial Results.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi and Swedish Krona. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. Dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Fluctuations in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Position.

Our profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. We maintain a revolving credit facility, which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio. A significant increase in LIBOR would significantly increase our cost of borrowings. We are also exposed to risks if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate, which may reduce the availability and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."

An Unfavorable Outcome of Any of Our Pending Contingencies or Litigation Could Adversely Affect Us.

We are currently involved in pending and threatened legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may also involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions, the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 10 in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”



Our Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill, are a Significant Portion of Our Total Assets and a Write-off of Our Intangible Assets or Goodwill Would Adversely Impact Our Operating Results and Significantly Reduce Our Net Worth.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At

December 31, 2019

, goodwill and intangible assets totaled

$1,779.7 million

and

$388.0 million

, respectively. These assets primarily result from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets we have acquired. Annually, or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation, we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels, we could be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact our results of operations and net worth. See Note 5 in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.

A Significant or Sustained Decline in Commodity Prices, Including Oil, Could Negatively Impact the Levels of Expenditures by Certain of Our Customers.

Demand for our products depends, in part, on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of our customers. The level of expenditures by our customers is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries. Reduced demand for our products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Success Depends on Our Executive Management and Other Key Personnel.

Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust. However, we provide long-term equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a long-term commitment to our Company. Our future success will also depend on our ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and implementation of our strategic plan.

Challenges with Respect to Labor Availability Could Negatively Impact our Ability to Operate or Grow our Business.

Our success depends in part on the ability of our businesses to proactively attract, motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market. A failure to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business.  Additionally, any labor stoppages or labor disruptions, including due to geopolitical unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business.

Our Business Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Information Systems Interruptions or Intrusion.

We depend on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. If these systems (or the systems of our customers or third-party hosting services) are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, given the



unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-security attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period.

Failure To Comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or Other Applicable Anti-bribery Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments.

Item 2.

Properties

.

The Company’s principal plants and offices have an aggregate floor space area of approximately 4.7 million square feet, of which 3.1 million square feet (66%) is located in the U.S. and approximately 1.6 million square feet (34%) is located outside the U.S., primarily in Germany (10%), U.K. (6%), Italy (5%), India (3%), China (2%), Sweden (2%), Canada (2%) and The Netherlands (2%). Management considers these facilities suitable and adequate for the Company’s operations. Management believes the Company can meet demand increases over the near term with its existing facilities, especially given its operational improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity. The Company’s executive office occupies 36,588 square feet of leased space in Lake Forest, Illinois and 16,268 square feet of leased space in Chicago, Illinois.

Approximately 2.9 million square feet (61%) of the principal plant and office floor area is owned by the Company and the balance is held under lease. Approximately 1.9 million square feet (39%) of the principal plant and office floor area is held by business units in the Fluid & Metering Technologies segment; 1.4 million square feet (30%) is held by business units in the Health & Science Technologies segment; and 1.2 million square feet (26%) is held by business units in the Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment. The remaining 0.2 million square feet (5%) include the executive office as well as shared services locations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to legal proceedings as described in Note 10 in Part II, Item 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” and such disclosure is incorporated by reference into this Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” In addition, the Company and six of its subsidiaries are presently named as defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various asbestos-related personal injuries, allegedly as a result of exposure to products manufactured with components that contained asbestos. These components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by the Company or any of the defendant subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company’s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance, subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover these settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance of the claims have been settled for various insignificant amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the Company’s business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe the asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(3)

Operating working capital is defined as inventory plus accounts receivable minus accounts payable.

(4)

Return on average assets is calculated as: Net income / (Current year Total assets + Prior year Total assets) / 2; Borrowings as a percent of capitalization is calculated as: (Long-term borrowings + Short-term borrowings) / (Long-term borrowings + Short-term borrowings + Total shareholders’ equity); Return on average shareholders’ equity is calculated as Net Income / (Current year Total shareholders’ equity + Prior year Total shareholders’ equity) / 2.

(5)

Set forth below are reconciliations of Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable measures of net income and operating income, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). We have reconciled Adjusted gross profit to Gross profit, Adjusted operating income to Operating income; Adjusted net income to Net income; Adjusted EPS to EPS; consolidated EBITDA, segment EBITDA, adjusted consolidated EBITDA and adjusted segment EBITDA to net income. The reconciliation of segment EBITDA to net income was performed on a consolidated basis due to the fact that we do not allocate consolidated interest expense or the consolidated provision for income taxes to our segments.

Management uses Adjusted gross profit, Adjusted operating income, Adjusted net income and Adjusted EPS as metrics by which to measure performance of the Company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as gains/losses on the sale of businesses, restructuring expenses, a fair value inventory step-up charge and pension settlements. Management also supplements its U.S. GAAP financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

EBITDA means earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Given the acquisitive nature of the Company, which results in a higher level of amortization expense from recently acquired businesses, management uses EBITDA as an internal operating metric to provide another representation of the businesses’ performance across our three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes. EBITDA is also used to calculate certain financial covenants, as discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” In addition, EBITDA has been adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as gains/losses on the sale of businesses, restructuring expenses, a fair value inventory step-up charge and pension settlements to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a performance indicator of ongoing operations. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to some investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and its segments’ ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may differ from that used by other companies.

Also set forth below is a reconciliation of the change in organic net sales to the comparable measure of net sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which represents the year-over-year consistency in net sales after excluding the impact from acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation. Refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of organic net sales.

The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis for definition and further discussion on organic sales.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this annual report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this annual report.

Results of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31,


compared to the year ended December 31,


, refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended

December 31, 2018

, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019. For purposes of this Item, reference is made to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses. Management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income and operating margin.

In the following discussion, and throughout this report, references to organic sales, a non-GAAP measure, refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to U.S. GAAP but excludes (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult due to the varying nature, size and number of transactions from period to period and between the Company and its peers.

. The increase in gross profit and margin is primarily a due to price capture and productivity initiatives, partially offset by a fair value inventory step-up charge, inflation and higher engineering costs.

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses

decreased

to

$525.0 million

in


from

$536.7 million

In


and


, the Company incurred pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling

$21.0 million

and

$12.1 million

, respectively, to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, primarily consisting of employee reductions, facility



rationalization and impairment charges.  The restructuring expenses included severance benefits of $9.8 million, exit costs of $1.1 million and impairment charges of $10.1 million. In the second quarter of 2019, the Company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the HST segment. Prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business, the business was informed in the third quarter of 2019 of the loss of its largest customer. As a result,the Company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time, requiring a $9.7 million impairment charge.  In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the consolidation of one of its facilities into the Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York, which resulted in a $0.4 million impairment charge.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities

increased

$48.7 million

, or

, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled

$632.6 million

, of which

$350.9 million

was held outside of the United States.

Investing Activities

Cash flows

used in

investing activities increased

$55.6 million

to

$137.0 million

in


, primarily due to $87.2 million spent on the acquisition of Velcora in 2019 compared to $20.2 million spent on the acquisition of FLI in 2018, partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2019 and $4.0 million spent on the purchase of intellectual property assets from Phantom in 2018.

Cash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of

$50.9 million

and

$56.1 million

in


and


, respectively. Capital expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that supported growth, improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities. Management believes that the Company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term.



Financing Activities

Cash flows

used in

financing activities decreased

$62.4 million

to

$227.6 million

in


, primarily as a result of lower share repurchases in 2019, partially offset by higher debt repayments due to the repayment of debt assumed in the Velcora acquisition and higher dividends paid in 2019.

On June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of a

$100 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.20%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 and a

$100 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.37%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (collectively, the “Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, dated June 13, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Each series of Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13

th

and December 13

th

. The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the Notes; provided that such portion is greater than

5%

of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the Notes by making an offer to all holders of the Notes, subject to certain conditions.

On May 31, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) along with certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, with other agents party thereto. The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which is an $800.0 million unsecured, multi-currency bank credit facility expiring on May 30, 2024. The Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s prior five-year, $700 million credit agreement, dated as of June 23, 2015, which was due to expire in June 2020. At December 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $8.5 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility of $791.5 million.

Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at either an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the better of the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR loans, on the last day of the applicable interest period selected, or every three months from the effective date of such interest period for interest periods exceeding three months. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed $400 million.

The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign

subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement.

On December 9, 2011, the Company completed a public offering of $350.0 million 4.2% senior notes due December 15, 2021 (“4.2% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering of $346.2 million, after deducting a $0.9 million issuance discount, a $2.3 million underwriting commission and $0.6 million of offering expenses, were used to repay $306.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. The 4.2% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.2% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The Company may redeem all or part of the 4.2% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Note Indenture governing the 4.2% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and 4.2% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.2% Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the 4.2% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

On December 6, 2010, the Company completed a public offering of $300.0 million 4.5% senior notes due December 15, 2020 (“4.5% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering of $295.7 million, after deducting a $1.6 million issuance discount, a $1.9 million underwriting commission and $0.8 million of offering expenses, were used to repay $250.0 million of outstanding bank indebtedness, with the balance used for general corporate purposes. The 4.5% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.5% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 15 and December 15. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the 4.5% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Note Indenture governing the 4.5% Senior Notes. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the Indenture. The Indenture and 4.5% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The terms of the 4.5% Senior Notes also require the Company to make



an offer to repurchase the 4.5% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the Notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of

3.0

to


and a maximum leverage ratio of

3.50

to


. In the case of the leverage ratio, there is an option to increase the ratio to 4.00 for 12 months in connection with certain acquisitions. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company’s interest coverage ratio was

16.04

to 1 and the leverage ratio was

1.23

to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 4.5% Senior Notes or 4.2% Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions.

On

December 1, 2015

the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase of

$300.0 million

in the authorized level for repurchases of common stock. This followed the prior Board of Directors approved repurchase authorization of $400.0 million that was announced by the Company on November 6, 2014. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility. During


, the Company repurchased a total of

389 thousand

shares at a cost of

$54.7 million

compared to

1.3 million

shares repurchased in


at a cost of

$173.9 million

. As of

December 31, 2019

, the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining is

$322.3 million

.

The Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock for the next twelve months. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings. As of

December 31, 2019

, there was

no

balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and

$8.5 million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

December 31, 2019

of approximately

$791.5 million

.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations include pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary course of business. There are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of our credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at

December 31, 2019

and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings. Additional detail regarding these obligations is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(1)

Includes interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates for variable debt.

(2)

Consists primarily of inventory commitments.

(3)

Comprises liabilities recorded on the balance sheet of $1,034.9 million and obligations not recorded on the balance sheet of $297.7 million.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Revenue recognition

— Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products or providing those services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the asset, which is in line with shipping terms. Certain units recognize revenue over time because control transfers continuously to our customers. Revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (i.e. the cost-to-cost method) or is recognized ratably over the contract term.  As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our estimates regularly. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs will be revised. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. The impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties (primarily assurance-type) and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets

— The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes. An impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through future operations. An impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset or goodwill exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. Assessments of possible impairments of long-lived or indefinite-lived intangible assets or goodwill are made if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, testing for possible impairments of recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset balances and goodwill is performed annually. On October 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. The amount and

timing of impairment charges for these assets require the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the related assets. In the second quarter of


, the Company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the HST segment. Prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business, the business was informed in the third quarter of


of the loss of its largest customer. As a result, the Company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time. This event required an interim impairment test be performed on the long-lived tangible assets of the business, which resulted in an impairment charge of

$9.7 million

, consisting of

$6.1 million

related to a customer relationships intangible asset,

$1.0 million

related to an unpatented technology intangible asset,

$2.0 million

related to property, plant and equipment and

$0.6 million

related to a building right-of-use asset. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the consolidation of one of its facilities into the Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York, which resulted in an impairment charge of

$0.4 million

related to a building right-of-use asset.  These charges were recorded as Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In


, there were no events that occurred or circumstances that changed that would have required a review other than as of our annual test date and the Company concluded that there were no long-lived assets with a fair value that was less than the carrying value.

The Company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in ASC 350,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

, to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. To determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the Company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations.



The key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine fair value. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted EBITDA and terminal growth rates. The


and


ranges for these three assumptions utilized by the Company are as follows:

In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month EBITDA and the forward looking 2020 EBITDA (50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. The market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted EBITDA and selected market multiples. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.

The Banjo trade name and the Akron Brass trade name are indefinite-lived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of these trade names. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

Defined benefit retirement plans —

The plan obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement plans are presented in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Level 1 assets are valued using unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. Level 2 assets are valued using quoted prices or other observable inputs for similar assets. Level 3 assets are valued using unobservable inputs, but reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets. Plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined after consulting with actuaries on a number of key assumptions and on information provided by the Company. Key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate, the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets. To the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts, results could be adversely affected.

The Society of Actuaries releases annual updates to mortality tables, which update life expectancy assumptions. IDEX adopts these annual updates and, in consideration of these tables, we modified the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2019

, which will have a related impact on our annual benefit expense in future years. New mortality tables may result in additional funding requirements dependent upon the funded status of our plans. These expectations presume all other assumptions remain constant and there are no changes to applicable funding regulations.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the (gain) loss amortization and interest cost components of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”), which in turn, may impact the Company’s funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. Each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate will cause a corresponding decrease in the PBO of approximately $25 million based upon the

December 31, 2019

data. Each 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate will cause a corresponding increase in the PBO of approximately $31 million based upon the

December 31, 2019

data.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Under the policy, the Company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes,



and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any derivative instruments outstanding.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

The Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the Euro, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi and Swedish Krona. The Company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of products. The foreign currency transaction losses (gains) for the periods ending

December 31, 2019

,


and


were

$3.3 million

,

$(2.4) million

and

$20.5 million

, respectively, and are reported within Other (income) expense - net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the

$20.5 million

reported as foreign currency transaction losses for the period ending December 31, 2017,

$20.2 million

was due to intercompany loans established in conjunction with the SFC Koenig acquisition. See Note 7 in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” for further discussion.

Interest Rate Fluctuations

The Company does not have significant interest rate exposure due to substantially all of the

$850,622

of debt outstanding as of

December 31, 2019

being fixed rate debt.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.

Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2019

.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, of the Company and our report dated

February 21, 2020

, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of IDEX Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December 31, 2019

and


, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated

February 21, 2020

, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue - Disaggregation of Revenue - Refer to Note 4 to the Financial Statements

The Company is a highly diversified business with a wide range of products and services that are offered in various markets throughout the world. The Company’s business activities are carried out by numerous individual business units, which offer a unique set of products and include niche markets within specific geographic areas.

We identified revenue as a critical audit matter given the disaggregated nature of the Company’s operations and business units generating revenue. This required extensive audit effort due to the volume of the underlying transactions and distinctiveness of each individual business unit.  High levels of auditor judgment were necessary to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures and the level of disaggregation within the Company at which to perform such procedures, especially given limited market data for certain products or geographic areas.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue transactions included the following, among others:

•

We tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including controls over revenue recognition and controls over the review of significant revenue transactions and operating results.

•

For a sample of revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to



source documents and determined that revenue was recorded appropriately.

•

For the revenue populations subject to detail testing, we tested the completeness of revenue by making selections from reciprocal populations (e.g., shipping logs) and determined whether the transaction was recorded as a sale in the general ledger.

•

For revenue transactions not subject to detail transaction testing, we aggregated the revenue transactions at the reporting unit level and performed substantive analytical procedures. We developed independent expectations of revenue based on data derived from published industry indices, market and customer trends, and the results of our detail revenue testing for similar business units and markets and compared these expectations to the revenue recorded by management.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1987.

Significant Accounting Policies

Business

IDEX is an applied solutions company specializing in the manufacture of fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers’ specifications. IDEX’s products are sold in niche markets across a wide range of industries throughout the world. The Company’s products include industrial pumps, compressors, flow meters, injectors, valves and related controls for use in a wide variety of process applications; precision fluidics solutions, including pumps, valves, degassing equipment, corrective tubing, fittings and complex manifolds, optical filters and specialty medical equipment and devices for use in life science applications; precision-engineered equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing paints; and engineered products for industrial and commercial markets, including fire and rescue, transportation equipment, oil and gas, electronics and communications. These activities are grouped into

three

reportable segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, product warranties, contingencies and litigation, insurance-related items, defined benefit retirement plans and purchase accounting related to acquisitions.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products or providing those services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the asset, which is in line with shipping terms. Certain units recognize revenue over time because control transfers continuously to our customers. Revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (i.e. the cost-to-cost method) or ratably over the contract term.  As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our estimates regularly. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs will be revised. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. The impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties (primarily assurance-type) and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.



Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of sales and are recognized as a period expense during the period in which they are incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs of

$

15.7

million

,

$

17.0

million

and

$

15.8

million

for


,


and


, respectively, are expensed as incurred within Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of

3 months or less

to be cash and cash equivalents.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable are recorded at face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers’ inability to make required payments. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes material, labor and factory overhead, is determined on a FIFO basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, for estimated excess, obsolete or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering changes.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

A long-lived asset is reviewed for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a long-lived asset below its carrying amount, as measured by comparing its net book value to the projected undiscounted future cash flows generated by its use. A long-lived asset impairment exists when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The amount and

timing of the impairment charge for this asset requires the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset. An impaired asset is recorded at its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In the second quarter of


, the Company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the Health & Science Technologies (“HST”) segment. Prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business, the business was informed in the third quarter of


of the loss of its largest customer. As a result, the Company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time. This event required an interim impairment test be performed on the long-lived tangible assets of the business, which resulted in an impairment charge of

$

9.7

million

, consisting of

$

6.1

million

related to a customer relationships intangible asset,

$

1.0

million

related to an unpatented technology intangible asset,

$

2.0

million

related to property, plant and equipment and

$

0.6

million

related to a building right-of-use asset. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the consolidation of one of its facilities in the HST segment into the Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York, which also resulted in an impairment charge of

$

0.4

million

related to a building right-of-use asset. These charges were recorded as Restructuring expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In


and


, the Company concluded that there were

no

long-lived assets with a fair value that was less than the carrying value.

See Note 14 for further discussion on restructuring activities.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 31, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these assets based on the estimated fair value of each of the


reporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 5 for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.



Borrowing Expenses

Expenses incurred in securing and issuing debt are capitalized and included as a reduction of Long-term borrowings. These amounts are amortized over the life of the related borrowing and the related amortization is included in Interest expense.

Earnings per Common Share

Earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents outstanding (diluted) during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options, which have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, restricted stock and performance share units.

ASC 260,

Earnings per Share

, concludes that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. If awards are considered participating securities, the Company is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its outstanding shares of restricted stock are participating securities. Accordingly, EPS was computed using the two-class method prescribed by ASC 260.

Basic weighted average shares outstanding reconciles to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows:

Options to purchase approximately

0.3

million

,

0.3

million

and

zero

shares of common stock in


,


and


, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718,

Compensation-Stock Compensation

. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based compensation plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See Note 15 for further discussion on share-based compensation.

Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Certain identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives used in the computation of amortization of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:



Research and Development Expenditures

Costs associated with engineering activities, including research and development, are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Cost of sales.

Total engineering expenses, which include research and development as well as application and support engineering, were

$

92.4

million

,

$

84.9

million

and

$

76.4

million

in


,


and


, respectively. Research and development expenses, which include costs associated with developing new products and major improvements to existing products, were

$

56.4

million

,

$

48.0

million

and

$

42.4

million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction

The functional currency of substantially all operations outside the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly, those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average monthly exchange rates for the year. Translation adjustments from year to year have been reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The foreign currency transaction losses (gains) for the periods ending

December 31, 2019

,


and


were

$

3.3

million

,

$(

2.4

) million

and

$

20.5

million

, respectively, and are reported within Other (income) expense - net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the

$

20.5

million

reported as foreign currency transaction losses for the period ending December 31, 2017,

$

20.2

million

was due to intercompany loans established in conjunction with the SFC Koenig acquisition. See Note 7 for further discussion.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.

Refer to Note 12 for further discussion on income taxes.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is not dependent on a single customer as its largest customer accounted for less than


%

of net sales for all years presented.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-02,

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

, which allows an entity to reclassify the stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings in the statement of shareholders’ equity.  The Company early adopted this standard on a retrospective basis on January 1, 2018. The adoption resulted in an increase of

$

6.4

million

to Retained earnings and a corresponding change of

$

6.4

million

to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at January 1, 2018.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01,

Clarifying the Definition of a Business

, which clarifies the definition of a business and assists entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. Under this guidance, when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or a group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not represent a business. In addition, in order to be considered a business, an acquisition would have to include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. The amended guidance also narrows the definition of outputs by more closely aligning it with how outputs are described in the FASB guidance for revenue recognition. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 and accounted for the purchase of the intellectual property assets from Phantom Controls utilizing this guidance. See Note 5 for further information.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16,

Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

, which amends Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740,

Income Taxes

. This ASU requires that the income tax consequences of an intra-



entity asset transfer other than inventory are recognized at the time of the transfer. An entity will continue to recognize the income tax consequences of an intercompany transfer of inventory when the inventory is sold to a third party. The Company adopted this standard on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2018. The adoption resulted in a decrease of

$

7.3

million

to Other current assets, a decrease of

$

6.7

million

to Deferred income taxes and a decrease of

$

0.6

million

to Retained earnings at January 1, 2018.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

(a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). This standard introduced a new lessee model that requires most leases to be recorded on the balance sheet and eliminates the required use of bright line tests for determining lease classification from U.S. GAAP. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10,

Codification Improvements to Topic 842

,

Leases

and ASU 2018-11,

Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,

which clarified ASU 2016-02 and had the same effective date as the original standard. ASU 2018-11 included an option to use the effective date of ASU 2016-02 as the date of initial application of transition as well as an option not to restate comparative periods in transition. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01,

Leases (Topic 842):

Codification Improvements,

which also clarified ASU 2016-02 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years.

The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2019 using the optional transition method provided by the FASB in ASU 2018-11. As we did not restate comparative periods, the adoption had no impact on our previously reported results. We elected to use the practical expedient that allowed us not to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases and the practical expedient that allows us to treat the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes. We also elected to account for short-term leases (i.e. leases with a term of one year or less) in accordance with ASC 842-20-25-2 (i.e. expensed over the term and not recorded on the balance sheet). The adoption of this standard impacted our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities. Upon adoption, we recognized right of use assets and lease liabilities of approximately

$


million

that reflected the present value of future lease payments. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows. See Note 9 for further information.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

which replaces numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a new five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.  Under ASU 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The FASB has also issued the following standards which clarify ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard: ASU 2016-08,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

; ASU 2016-10,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing

; ASU 2016-12

,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients

; and ASU 2016-20

, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

In 2016, we established an implementation team and analyzed the impact of the standard by surveying business units and performing extensive contract reviews to identify potential differences that may result from applying the requirements of the new standard. The contract reviews generally supported the recognition of revenue at a point in time, which was consistent with the revenue recognition model used by most of our business units. As a result, revenue recognition was unchanged under the new standard. For our business units that previously recognized revenue under a percentage of completion model, revenue recognition was also unchanged as the contract reviews supported the recognition of revenue over time. The Company implemented the appropriate changes to its processes, systems and controls to comply with the new guidance. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018.



The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements, except to provide additional disclosures. The Company elected the following practical expedients: significant financing component, sales tax presentation, contract costs, shipping and handling activities and disclosures. See Note 4 for further details on revenue.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

Financial Instruments - Credit losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

and in November 2018 issued a subsequent amendment, ASU 2018-19,

Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.

ASU 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. ASU 2016-13 will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost. ASU 2018-19 will affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope of this amendment that represent the contractual right to receive cash. ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2018-19 should be applied on either a prospective transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

2.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

All of the Company’s acquisitions of businesses have been accounted for under ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after adjustments to reflect the fair values assigned to assets and liabilities, have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the Company’s consolidated results since the date of each acquisition. Supplemental pro forma information has not been provided as the acquisitions did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate.

2019 Acquisition

On July 18, 2019, the Company acquired the stock of Velcora Holding AB (“Velcora”) and its operating subsidiaries, Roplan and Steridose. Roplan is a global manufacturer of custom mechanical and shaft seals for a variety of end markets including food and beverage, marine, chemical, wastewater and water treatment. Steridose develops engineered hygienic mixers and valves for the global biopharmaceutical industry. Both companies are headquartered in Sweden, with operations in China, the United Kingdom and the United States and operate in our Health & Science Technologies segment. Velcora was acquired for cash consideration of

$

87.2

million and the assumption of

$

51.1

million of debt. The entire purchase price was funded with cash on hand. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized as part of this transaction were

$

85.9

million

and

$

48.2

million

, respectively. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The Company made an initial allocation of the purchase price for the Velcora acquisition as of the acquisition date based on its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. As the Company continues to obtain additional information about these assets and liabilities, including intangible asset appraisals, and continues to learn more about the newly acquired businesses, we will refine the estimates of fair value and more accurately allocate the purchase price. Only items identified as of the acquisition date are considered for subsequent adjustment. The Company will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period, as required.



The preliminary allocation of the acquisition costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, is as follows:

Acquired intangible assets consist of trade names, customer relationships and unpatented technology. The goodwill recorded for the acquisitions reflects the strategic fit, revenue and earnings growth potential of these businesses.

The acquired intangible assets and weighted average amortization periods are as follows:

On September 3, 2019, the Company settled the debt assumed in the Velcora acquisition and incurred a loss on early retirement of

$

0.7

million

which was recorded in Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

The Company incurred

$

1.7

million

of acquisition-related transaction costs in


. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and were related to completed transactions, pending transactions and potential transactions, including transactions that ultimately were not completed.  The Company also incurred a

$

3.3

million

fair value inventory step-up charge associated with the completed 2019 acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2019.  This charge was recorded in Cost of sales.

2018 Acquisition

On July 23, 2018, the Company acquired Finger Lakes Instrumentation (“FLI”), a technology leader in the design, development and production of low-noise cooled CCD and high speed, high-sensitivity Scientific CMOS cameras for the astronomy and life science markets. Headquartered in Lima, NY, FLI operates in our Health & Science Technologies segment. FLI was acquired  for an aggregate purchase price of

$

23.6

million, consisting of

$

20.2

million in cash and contingent consideration valued at

$

3.4

million as of the opening balance sheet date. The contingent consideration is based on the achievement of financial objectives during the


-month period following the close of the transaction. The entire purchase price was funded with cash on hand. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized as part of this transaction were

$

12.4

million and

$

7.9

million, respectively. Acquired intangible assets consist of trade names, customer relationships and unpatented technology. The goodwill recorded for the acquisition reflects the strategic fit, revenue and earnings growth potential of this business. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

In the third quarter of 2019, the Company finalized its allocation of the purchase price for the FLI acquisition based on its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.



The Company incurred

$

3.0

million

of acquisition-related transaction costs in


.

These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and were related to completed transactions, pending transactions and potential transactions, including transactions that ultimately were not completed.

2017 Acquisition

On December 8, 2017, the Company acquired the stock of thinXXS, a leader in the design, manufacture, and sale of microfluidic components serving the point of care, veterinary, and life science markets. The business was acquired to complement our existing CiDRA Precision Services business and expand on our microfluidic and nanofluidic capabilities. Headquartered in Zweibrücken, Germany, thinXXS operates in our Health & Science Technologies segment. thinXXS was acquired for cash consideration of

$

38.2

million and the assumption of

million of debt. The purchase price was funded with cash on hand. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized as part of the transaction were

$

25.2

million and

$

10.6

million, respectively. Acquired intangible assets consist of trade names, customer relationships and unpatented technology. The goodwill recorded for the acquisition reflects the strategic fit, revenue and earnings growth potential of this business. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company finalized its allocation of the purchase price for the thinXXS acquisition based on its understanding of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value measurements were classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The Company incurred

$

1.3

million of acquisition-related transaction costs in


. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses and were related to completed transactions, pending transactions and potential transactions, including transactions that ultimately were not completed.

Divestitures

The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its strategic objectives and focuses on core business and customers. Any resulting gain or loss recognized due to divestitures is recorded within Loss (gain) on sale of businesses - net.  There were no divestitures that took place during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.  The Company concluded that the divestiture that took place during the year ended December 31,


did not meet the criteria for reporting discontinued operations.

On October 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Faure Herman subsidiary for

Revenue

IDEX is an applied solutions company specializing in the manufacture of fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers’ specifications. The Company’s products include industrial pumps, compressors, flow meters, injectors, valves and related controls for use in a wide variety of process applications; precision fluidics solutions, including pumps, valves, degassing equipment, corrective tubing, fittings and complex manifolds, optical filters and specialty medical equipment and devices for use in life science applications; precision-engineered equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing paints; and engineered products for industrial and commercial markets, including fire and rescue, transportation equipment, oil and gas, electronics and communications.

Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those products or providing those services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. We determine the appropriate revenue recognition for our contracts with customers by analyzing the type, terms and conditions of each contract or arrangement with a customer.

Disaggregation of Revenue

We have a comprehensive offering of products, including technologies, built to customers’ specifications that are sold in niche markets throughout the world. We disaggregate our revenue from contracts with customers by reporting unit and geographical region for each of our segments as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue was attributed to geographical region based on location of the customer. The following tables present our revenue disaggregated by reporting unit and geographical region.

Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in customer receivables, advance payments or billings in excess of revenue recognized. Customer receivables include both amounts billed and currently due from customers as well as unbilled amounts (contract assets) and are included in Receivables - net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts are billed in accordance with contractual terms or as work progresses. Unbilled amounts arise when the timing of billing differs from the timing of revenue recognized, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Unbilled amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer as there is not yet a right to invoice in accordance with contractual terms. Unbilled amounts are recorded as a contract asset when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Customer receivables are recorded at face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of customers’ inability to make required payments. Management evaluates the aging of the customer receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of customer receivables that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

The composition of Customer receivables was as follows:

Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are included in Deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the revenue. The current portion is included in Accrued expenses and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Advance payments represent contract liabilities and are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying



performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations satisfied over time. We generally receive advance payments from customers related to maintenance services which we recognize ratably over the service term. Billings in excess of revenue recognized represent contract liabilities and primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and revenue cannot yet be recognized as the Company has not completed the corresponding performance obligation. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied.

The composition of Deferred revenue was as follows:

Performance Obligations

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.  For our contracts that require complex design, manufacturing and installation activities, certain promises may not be separately identifiable from other promises in the contract and, therefore, not distinct. As a result, the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. For our contracts that include distinct products or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct products or services. Certain of our contracts have multiple performance obligations for which we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct product or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer generally represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price. In certain cases, we may be required to estimate standalone selling price using the expected cost plus margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct product or service.

Our performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers that provide a framework for the nature of the distinct products or services or bundle of products and services. We define service revenue as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development or manufacture of a product or the delivery of a software license.

Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time approximated


%

of total revenues in both the years ended

December 31, 2019

and 2018. Revenue recognized at a point in time relates to the majority of our product sales. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with our customer are satisfied. Generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the asset, which is in line with shipping terms.

Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time approximated


%

of total revenues in both the years ended

December 31, 2019

and 2018. Revenue earned by certain business units within the Water, Energy, Material Processing Technologies (“MPT”) and Dispensing reporting units is recognized over time because control transfers continuously to our customers. When accounting for over-time contracts, we use an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For certain business units within the Water, Energy and MPT reporting units, revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (i.e. the cost-to-cost method). We believe this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material and overhead. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. For certain business units within the Energy and Dispensing reporting units, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.

As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our estimates regularly. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs,



including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. The impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties (primarily assurance-type) and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for


and


, by reportable business segment, were as follows:

ASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. In


and


, there were no events or circumstances that would have required an interim impairment test. Goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives were tested for impairment as of October 31,


, the Company’s annual impairment test date. In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing twelve month EBITDA and the forward looking


EBITDA (50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. The market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted EBITDA and selected market multiples. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and the income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units.



The following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset at

December 31, 2019

and


:

On June 22, 2018, the Company acquired the intellectual property assets of Phantom Controls (“Phantom”) for cash consideration of

$

4.0

million

. The operational capabilities and innovative pump operation of Phantom’s technology complements our existing water-flow expertise of Hale, Akron Brass and Class 1 to improve fire ground safety and reduce operational complexity during mission critical response. This acquisition of intellectual property assets did not meet the definition of a business under ASU 2017-01 and thus the Company recorded the entire purchase price to the Unpatented technology class of intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Banjo trade name and the Akron Brass trade name are indefinite-lived intangible assets which are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of these trade names. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates.

In the second quarter of 2019, the Company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the HST segment. Prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business, the business was informed in the third quarter of 2019 of the loss of its largest customer. As a result, the Company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time. This event required an interim impairment test be performed on certain of its definite-lived intangible assets, which resulted in an impairment charge of

$

7.1

million

, consisting of

$

6.1

million

related to customer relationships and

$

1.0

related to unpatented technology. This charge was recorded as Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 14 for further discussion.

and


consisted of the following:

On June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of a

$


million

aggregate principal amount of

3.20

%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 and a

$


million

aggregate principal amount of

3.37

%

Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (collectively, the “Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement dated June 13, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Each series of Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13

th

and December 13

th

. The Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the Notes, provided that such portion is greater than


%

of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the Notes by making an offer to all holders of the Notes, subject to certain conditions.

The Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, incur indebtedness, create liens, transact with affiliates and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or other change of control transactions. In addition, the Company must comply with a leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, as further described below, and the Purchase Agreement also limits the outstanding principal amount of priority debt that may be incurred by the Company to


%

of consolidated assets. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment event of default, any holder of the Notes affected thereby may declare all of the Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the Notes may declare all of the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

On May 31, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) along with certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, with other agents party thereto.  The Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s prior

five

-year

$


million

credit agreement, dated as of June 23, 2015, which was due to expire in June 2020.

Terms and fees of the 2019 Credit Agreement are essentially the same as the 2015 credit agreement except for certain fees and interest rate pricing that are more favorable to the Company.

The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of

$


million

, with a final maturity date of

May 30, 2024

. The maturity date may be extended under certain conditions for an additional

one

-year term. Up to

$


million

of the Revolving Facility under the Credit Agreement is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to

$


million

of the Revolving Facility is available to the Company for swing line loans, available on a same-day basis.

Proceeds of the Revolving Facility are available for use by the Borrowers for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may request increases in the



lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed

$


million

. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the better of the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR rate loans, on the last day of the applicable interest period selected, or every three months from the effective date of such interest period for interest periods exceeding three months.

The Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon (a) the amount of the lenders’ commitments under the credit facility from time to time, (b) the applicable corporate credit ratings of the Company or (c) the applicable leverage ratio of the Company. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants usual and customary for such senior unsecured credit agreements, including an interest coverage ratio test and a leverage ratio test, in each case tested quarterly and, in the case of the leverage ratio, with an option to increase the ratio for 12 months in connection with certain acquisitions. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company on granting liens, entering into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company), making certain subsidiary dividends or distributions, engaging in materially different lines of businesses and allowing subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt.

The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate).

At

December 31, 2019

, there was

no

balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and

$

8.5

million

of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at

As of December 31, 2019, the

$

300.0

million

4.5

%

Senior Notes are due in December 2020 but have not been classified as short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company has the ability and intent to either refinance or repay the Notes using the available borrowing capacity of the Revolving Facility.  As a result, the

4.5

%

Senior Notes remain classified as long-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2019

There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the Notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of

3.0

to


and a maximum leverage ratio of

3.50

to


, which is the ratio of the Company’s consolidated total debt to its consolidated EBITDA. In the case of the leverage ratio, there is an option to increase the ratio to

4.00

for 12 months in connection with certain acquisitions. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants. There are no financial covenants relating to the

Derivative Instruments

The Company enters into cash flow hedges from time to time to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include foreign currency exchange contracts designed to minimize the earnings impact on certain intercompany loans as well as interest rate exchange agreements designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.

The effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate exchange agreements is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is recognized in net income during the period of change. See Note 16 for the amount of loss reclassified into income for interest rate contracts for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


. As of

December 31, 2019

, the Company did not have any interest rate contracts outstanding.

On April 15, 2010, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate contract with a notional amount of

$

300.0

million

and a settlement date in December 2010. This contract was entered into in anticipation of the issuance of the

4.5

%

Senior Notes and was designed to lock in the market interest rate as of April 15, 2010. In December 2010, the Company settled and paid this interest rate contract for

$

31.0

million

. The

$

31.0

of the pre-tax amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity at

December 31, 2019

will be recognized in net income over the next 12 months as the underlying hedged transactions are realized.

At March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts with a combined notional value of

€


million

that were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and, as a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts and the corresponding foreign currency gain or loss on the revaluation of the intercompany loans were both recorded through earnings within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations each period as incurred.

In April 2018, the Company settled its outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts in conjunction with its repayment of the underlying intercompany loans and did not extend these foreign currency exchange contracts. Along with the repayment of the intercompany loans, the Company was required to make a capital contribution to one of its subsidiaries, which resulted in a

$

2.2

million

stamp duty in Switzerland which was recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As a result of the foreign currency exchange contracts being settled in April 2018, the Company received

$

6.6

million

of proceeds. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded gains of

$

0.9

million

and

$

19.8

million

, respectively, within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to these foreign currency exchange contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of

$

0.9

million

and

$

20.2

million

, respectively, within Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to these intercompany loans.

Fair values relating to derivative financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to sell or buy the contracts based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts at each balance sheet date.

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,

defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:

•

Level 1:    Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2:    Inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

The Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of FLI as of the acquisition date. The

$

3.4

million

represents management’s best estimate of the liability, based on a range of outcomes of FLI’s two-year operating results, from August 1, 2018 to July 31, 2020, and is expected to be paid during the third quarter of 2020. As of

December 31, 2019

, the

$

3.4

million

of contingent consideration is included in Accrued Expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments. At

Leases

The Company leases certain office facilities, warehouses, manufacturing plants, equipment (which includes both office and plant equipment) and vehicles under operating leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Certain leases include

one

or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. There are currently no renewal periods included in any of the leases’ respective lease terms as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not have any material purchase options.

Certain of our lease agreements have rental payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or that are based on usage. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of

December 31, 2019

was as follows:

In the second quarter of 2019, the Company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the HST segment. Prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business, the business was informed in the



third quarter of 2019 of the loss of its largest customer. As a result, the Company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time. This event required an interim impairment test be performed on its long-lived assets, which resulted in an impairment charge of

$

0.6

million

related to its building right-of-use asset. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed the consolidation of one of its facilities in the HST segment into the Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York, which also resulted in an impairment charge of

$

0.4

million

related to its building right-of-use asset.  These charges were recorded as Restructuring expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 14 for further discussion.

As part of the adoption of the new lease standard, the Company derecognized its liability for the construction of a new leased facility that was recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded it as a right of use asset in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding lease liability in Accrued expenses and Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Commitments and Contingencies

Warranty costs are provided for at the time of sale. The warranty provision is based on historical costs and adjusted for specific known claims.

A rollforward of the warranty reserve is as follows:

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in pending and threatened legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may also involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Although the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income. The computed amount and the differences for


,


and


are as follows:

On

December 22, 2017

, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to the Company, including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from

35%

to

21%

effective

January 1, 2018

. The Tax Act also included a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income of foreign subsidiaries, a special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income and a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure that may tax certain payments between a U.S. corporation and its subsidiaries. These additional provisions of the Tax Act were effective beginning

January 1, 2018

.

The Company has

$

26.5

million

and

$

18.2

million

of permanently reinvested earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. No deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on the

$

26.5

million

of permanently reinvested earnings, as these earnings are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time. It should also be noted that the aforementioned earnings will not incur U.S. taxes when ultimately repatriated other than potentially U.S. state and local taxes and/or U.S. federal income taxes on foreign exchange gains or losses crystalized on the distribution of such earnings. Such distributions could also be subject to additional foreign withholding and foreign income taxes. The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on currently permanently reinvested earnings is estimated to be

$

5.4

million

and

$

3.7

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

During the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, the Company repatriated

$

99.0

million

,

$

135.0

million

and

$

3.3

million

of foreign earnings, respectively. These actual distributions resulted in

no

incremental income tax expense for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, and

$

6.4

million

of incremental income tax benefit for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. These repatriations represent distributions of previously taxed income as well as distributions from liquidating subsidiaries.

Because the changes included in the Tax Act were broad and complex, on December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB 118”), which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company was required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete. To the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act was incomplete but it was able to determine a reasonable estimate, it was required to record a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company, as required under SAB 118, completed the



accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company’s completed accounting of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act is as follows:

Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax:

The Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (“Transition Tax”) is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company had to determine, in addition to other factors, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of the relevant subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings. The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and recorded a provisional Transition Tax obligation of

$

30.3

million

for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the IRS released Revenue Procedure 2018-17 and Notice 2018-26, the effects of which increased the provisional Transition Tax by

$

0.1

million

. The Company updated its Transaction Tax obligation in the fourth quarter of 2018 recording a

$

3.9

million

tax benefit which, together with the first quarter adjustment, resulted in an updated Transition Tax obligation of

$

26.5

million

.  The Company finalized its Transition Tax obligation in the fourth quarter of 2019 for an adjustment and foreign tax credit carrybacks which resulted in a final Transition Tax obligation of

$

20.6

million

.

Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate

: The Tax Act reduces the corporate tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.  The Company recorded a decrease in its deferred tax liability of

$

40.6

million

, with a corresponding adjustment to deferred income tax benefit of

$

40.6

million

for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company finalized the impact of the rate change on its deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter of 2018 recording an additional

$

1.1

million

tax benefit. The total reduction to the deferred tax liability related to the rate change was

$

41.7

million

.

Removal of Permanent Reinvestment Representation on certain undistributed foreign earnings

: As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company had decided to remove the Permanent Reinvestment Representation with respect to certain of its subsidiaries in Canada, Italy and Germany as of December 31, 2017. Under the mandatory repatriation provisions of the Tax Act, post-1986 undistributed earnings were taxed in the U.S. as if they were distributed before December 31, 2017. However, with the removal of the Permanent Reinvestment Representation with respect to select subsidiaries in Canada, Italy and Germany, the non-creditable withholding taxes and any local country taxes associated with future dividends from these subsidiaries were required to be recorded as deferred tax liabilities as of the end of 2017. The Company recorded a provisional increase in its deferred tax liability of

$

9.2

million

, with a corresponding adjustment to deferred income tax expense of

$

9.2

million

for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the second quarter of 2018, the deferred tax liability was reduced by

$

1.4

million

to

$

7.8

million

.

No

adjustments were made to the deferred tax liability during the third quarter of 2018. The Company removed the Permanent Reinvestment Representation during the fourth quarter of 2018 for all remaining non-U.S. subsidiaries except for its entity in India. This change resulted in an additional

$

9.1

million

increase to its deferred tax liability with a corresponding adjustment to deferred tax expense.

Global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”)

: The Tax Act creates a new requirement that certain income (i.e. GILTI) earned by controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”) must be included currently in the gross income of the CFC’s U.S. shareholder. GILTI is the excess of the U.S. shareholder’s “net CFC tested income” over the net deemed intangible income return, which is currently defined as the excess of (1)


%

of the aggregate of the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net CFC-tested income. In January 2018, FASB released guidance on the accounting for the GILTI tax. The guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred taxes related to GILTI tax inclusions or treating the GILTI tax as a period cost are both acceptable methods subject to an accounting policy election. The Company treats the GILTI tax as a period cost.



Although the SAB 118 measurement period has closed, further technical guidance related to the Tax Act, including final regulations on a broad range of topics, is expected to be issued.  In accordance with ASC 740, the Company will recognize any effects of the guidance in the period that such guidance is issued.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for


,


and


is as follows:

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of

December 31, 2019

,


and


, we had approximately

$

0.2

million

,

$

0.1

million

and

$

0.1

million

, respectively, of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. The Company had

no

accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions during these years.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized is

$

3.0

million

,

$

3.0

million

and

$

0.9

million

as of

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively. The tax years 2013-2018 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next 12 months by a range of

zero

to

$

0.9

million

.

The Company had net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards related to prior acquisitions for U.S. federal purposes at

Share-Based Compensation

The Company maintains

two

share-based compensation plans for executives, non-employee directors and certain key employees that authorize the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance share units and other types of awards consistent with the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s plans as of

December 31, 2019



totaled

15.6

million

, of which

3.4

million

shares were available for future issuance. The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, assuming forfeitures, over the requisite service period for the entire award.

The Company typically grants equity awards annually at its regularly scheduled first quarter meeting of the Board of Directors based on their recommendation from the Compensation Committee.

Stock Options

Stock options granted under the Company’s plans are generally non-qualified and are granted

with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Binomial lattice option pricing model. The majority of the options issued to employees vest ratably over

four years

, with vesting beginning one year from the date of grant, and generally expire


years

from the date of grant.

Weighted average option fair values and assumptions for the periods specified are as follows:

The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the contractual term of the option.

•

The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life of the option. The expected life assumption for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


is an output of the Binomial lattice option pricing model, which incorporates vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option to define expected employee behavior.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option. For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, we present the range of risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice option pricing model.

•

The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the option.

Performance Share Units

Beginning in 2013, the Company granted performance share units to selected key employees that may be earned based on IDEX total shareholder return over the three-year period following the date of grant. Performance share units are expected to be made annually and are paid out at the end of a

three

-year period based on the Company’s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of IDEX common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of the S&P Midcap 400 Industrial Group (for awards granted prior to 2016) or the Russell Midcap Index (for awards granted in 2016 - 2019) for the three-year period following the date of grant. The payment of awards following the three-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from


percent to


percent of the initial grant. A target payout of


percent is earned if total shareholder return is equal to the 50

th

percentile of the peer group. Performance share units earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of performance share units that are earned. Payments made at the end of the award period will be in the form of stock for performance share units and will be in cash for dividend equivalents. The Company’s performance share units are considered market condition awards, have been assessed at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and are expensed ratably over the three-year term of the awards. The Company granted approximately

0.1

million

of performance share units in each of


,


and


.

Weighted average performance share unit fair values and assumptions for the period specified are as follows:



The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the remaining performance period as of the grant date.

•

The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses an expected life commensurate with the performance period. As a result, the expected life of the performance share units was assumed to be the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term commensurate with the remaining performance period.

•

Total Shareholder Return is determined assuming that dividends are reinvested in the issuing entity over the performance period, which is mathematically equivalent to utilizing a


%

dividend yield.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of Other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:



Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to net income are summarized as follows:

The Company recognizes the service cost component in both Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the functional area of the underlying employees included in the plans.

Retirement Benefits

The Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement plans for its employees. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans. The Company employs the measurement date provisions of ASC 715,

Compensation-Retirement Benefits

, which require the measurement date of plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor’s year end.

Effective September 30, 2019, the IDEX Corporation Retirement Plan (“Plan”), a U.S. defined benefit plan, was amended to freeze the accrual of retirement benefits for all participants. This action impacted fewer than


participants, as the Plan had been closed to new entrants as of December 31, 2004 and frozen as of December 31, 2005 for all but certain older, longer service participants. The overall financial impact of the freeze was to reduce the Plan liabilities by approximately

$

1.2

million

.  In addition, the Company recorded a settlement charge of

$

0.7

million

which was recorded in Other (income) expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.  Subsequent to the freeze, termination of the Plan was approved in November 2019. Participants were notified in February 2020 and the Plan will be terminated in May 2020.  As a result, the disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2019 were prepared on a liquidation basis of accounting.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets over the two-year period ended

December 31, 2019

and a statement of the funded status at December 31 for both years.



The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for all defined benefit pension plans was

$

193.3

million

and

$

169.5

million

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligation at

The components of, and the weighted average assumptions used to determine, the net periodic benefit cost for the plans in


,


and


are as follows:



* A discount rate of

4.11

%

was used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the period January 1, 2019 through August 31, 2019 and a discount rate of

2.99

%

was used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the period September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 as a result of the remeasurement that occurred in conjunction with the decision to freeze the Plan.

The pretax change recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in


is as follows:

The discount rates for our plans are derived by matching the plan’s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same present value of cash flows.

In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the plan’s target asset allocation and current market conditions.

Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of


%

of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.

Costs of defined contribution plans were

$

12.4

million

,

$

12.2

million

and

$

10.2

million

for


,


and


, respectively.

The Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in certain multi-employer pension plans covering approximately


participants under U.S. collective bargaining agreements. None of these plans are considered individually significant to the Company as contributions to these plans totaled

For measurement purposes, a

5.84

%

weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for


. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually each year to a rate of

4.45

%

for


, and remain at that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A

1%

increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by

$

0.1

million

and the health care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by

$

1.9

million

.



A

Plan Assets

The Company’s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at

December 31, 2019

and


, by asset category, were as follows:

The basis used to measure the defined benefit plans’ assets at fair value at

Other commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments in non-U.S. plans.



(1)

Other commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments in non-U.S. plans.

Equities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors.

Investment Policies and Strategies

The investment objective of the U.S. plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn the highest possible total rate of return consistent with the plan’s tolerance for risk. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that “equities” will constitute


%

and “fixed income” obligations, including cash, will constitute from


%

of the market value of total fund assets. The investment objective of the UK plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn a target return of UK Gilts plus

2.5

%

per year. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that “equities” will constitute from


%

to


%

of the market value of total fund assets with a target of


%

, and “fixed income” obligations, including cash, will constitute from


%

to


%

with a target of


%

. The term “equities” includes common stock, while the term “fixed income” includes obligations with contractual payments and a specific maturity date. The Company, through the use of a professional independent advisor, will monitor the asset allocation daily and maintain an asset allocation that closely replicates the designated targets. Diversification of assets is employed to ensure that adverse performance of one security or security class does not have an undue detrimental impact on the portfolio as a whole. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by type, characteristic and number of investments as well as by investment style of designated investment fund managers. No restrictions are placed on the selection of individual investments by the investment fund managers. The total fund performance and the performance of the investment fund managers is reviewed on a regular basis using an appointed professional independent advisor. As of December 31, 2019, there were

no

shares of the Company’s stock held in plan assets.

Cash Flows

The Company expects to contribute approximately

$

3.0
