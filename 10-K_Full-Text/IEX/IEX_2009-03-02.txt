Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors.

For an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide
    range of factors could materially affect future developments and
    performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific
    business operations identified in connection with the
    description of these operations and the financial results of
    these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant
    factors affecting our operations include the following:

THE
    RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS AND CURRENT UNCERTAINTY IN GLOBAL
    ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH
    FLOWS.

The recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and
    financial markets and the current uncertainty in global economic
    conditions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets,
    a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme
    volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. There
    could be a number of follow-on effects from these economic
    developments on our business, including insolvency of key
    suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to
    obtain credit to finance purchases of our products

and/or

customer insolvencies; decreased customer confidence; and
    decreased customer demand, including order delays or
    cancellations.

CHANGES
    IN U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD
    ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR
    BUSINESSES.

In 2008, 53% of the Company’s revenue was derived from
    domestic operations while 47% was international. The
    Company’s largest markets include life sciences &
    medical technologies, fire and rescue, petroleum LPG, paint and
    coatings, chemical processing and water & wastewater
    treatment. A slowdown in the economy and in particular any of
    these specific end markets could directly affect the
    Company’s revenue stream and profitability.

POLITICAL
    CONDITIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD
    ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

In 2008, approximately 47% of our total sales were to customers
    outside the U.S. We expect international operations and
    export sales to continue to contribute to earnings for the
    foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations
    and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks
    inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks
    include the following:

• possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising
    from host country laws or regulations;

• risks of economic instability;

• currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions
    on currency repatriation;

• potential negative consequences from changes to
    taxation policies;

• the disruption of operations from labor and
    political disturbances;

• changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or
    export licensing requirements; and,

• insurrection or war.

We cannot predict the impact such future, largely unforeseeable
    events might have on the Company’s operations.



AN
    INABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS CAN LIMIT THE
    COMPANY’S REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.

The Company’s organic growth was flat in 2008 and 6% in
    2007. Approximately 14% of our revenue was derived from new
    products developed over the past three years. Our ability to
    continue to grow organically is tied to our ability to continue
    to develop new products.

OUR
    GROWTH STRATEGY INCLUDES ACQUISITIONS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
    MAKE ACQUISITIONS OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES OR INTEGRATE
    ACQUISITIONS SUCCESSFULLY.

Our historical growth has included, and our future growth is
    likely to continue to include, in large part our acquisition
    strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses
    into our existing operations.

We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition
    opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our
    position in existing markets throughout the world. We cannot be
    assured, however, that we will be able to successfully identify
    suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms,
    obtain financing which may be needed to consummate such
    acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully
    integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or
    expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure you that
    any acquisition, once successfully integrated, will perform as
    planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to
    our operations and cash flow.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in
    the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and
    products of the acquired companies and the diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns. In
    addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
    acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial
    additional indebtedness and other expenses. Once integrated,
    acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues,
    profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by
    our existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected.

THE
    MARKETS WE SERVE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THIS COMPETITION COULD
    LIMIT THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL AND REDUCE OUR
    OPERATING MARGINS.

Most of our products are sold in competitive markets. We believe
    that the principal points of competition in our markets are
    product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities,
    product development, conformity to customer specifications,
    quality of post-sale support, timeliness of delivery, and
    effectiveness of our distribution channels. Maintaining and
    improving our competitive position will require continued
    investment by us in manufacturing, engineering, quality
    standards, marketing, customer service and support, and our
    distribution networks. We cannot be assured that we will be
    successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our
    competitors may develop products that are superior to our
    products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and
    effectively providing products and services or may adapt more
    quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer
    requirements. Pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust
    the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We
    cannot be assured that we will be able to compete successfully
    with our existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure
    to continue competing successfully could adversely affect our
    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flow.

WE ARE
    DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PARTS AND
    COMPONENTS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS.

While we manufacture many of the parts and components used in
    our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials
    and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The
    availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components
    may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other
    things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers,
    interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange
    rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of,
    or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could
    materially affect our business, financial condition, results of
    operations and cash flow.



SIGNIFICANT
    MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MAY HARM OUR
    FINANCIAL RESULTS.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar,
    British Pound and Chinese Renminbi. Any significant change in
    the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do
    business against the U.S. Dollar could affect our ability
    to sell products competitively and control our cost structure,
    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. For
    additional detail related to this risk, see Part II.
    Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About
    Market Risk.

AN
    UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME WITH REGARDS TO ANY OF OUR PENDING
    CONTINGENCIES OR LITIGATION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,
    FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH
    FLOW.

We currently are involved in certain legal and regulatory
    proceedings. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue
    estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these
    matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with
    outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential
    results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement
    strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating
    results for any particular quarter or annual period could be
    materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the
    effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.
    For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3.
    Legal Proceedings.

WE
    COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RAPID CHANGES IN INTEREST
    RATES.

Our profitability may be adversely affected during any period of
    an unexpected or rapid increase in interest rates. The
    Company’s interest rate exposure was primarily related to
    the $554.0 million of total debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2008. The majority of the debt is priced at
    interest rates that float with the market. In order to mitigate
    this interest exposure, the Company entered into interest rate
    exchange agreements that effectively converted
    $350.0 million of our floating-rate debt to a fixed rate. A
    50 basis point movement in the interest rate on the
    remaining $204.0 million floating-rate debt would result in
    an approximate $1.0 million annualized increase or decrease
    in interest expense and cash flow. For additional detail related
    to this risk, see Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

OUR
    INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS
    AND A WRITE-OFF OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD CAUSE A MAJOR
    IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S NET WORTH.

Our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets,
    primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At
    December 31, 2008, goodwill and intangible assets totaled
    $1,167.1 million and $303.2 million, respectively.
    These intangible assets and goodwill result from our
    acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair
    value of the tangible assets we have acquired. Annually, or when
    certain events occur that require a more current valuation, we
    assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our
    intangible assets or goodwill. If future operating performance
    at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly
    below forecast levels, we could reflect, under current
    applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating
    earnings for an impairment. Any determination requiring the
    write-off of a significant portion of the intangible assets or
    goodwill could have a material negative effect on our results of
    operations and total capitalization. In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)
    No. 142, the Company concluded that events had occurred and
    circumstances had changed in 2008 which required the Company to
    record a goodwill impairment of $30.1 million at Fluid
    Management Americas, a reporting unit within the Company’s
    Dispensing Equipment segment. See Note 4 in Part II.
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
    further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.



Item 1B.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments.

The Company has received no written comments regarding its
    periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more
    preceding the end of its 2008 calendar year and that remain
    unresolved.

Item 2.

Properties.

The Company’s principal plants and offices have an
    aggregate floor space area of approximately 4.0 million
    square feet, of which 2.5 million square feet (62%) is
    located in the U.S. and approximately 1.5 million
    square feet (38%) is located outside the U.S., primarily in
    Italy (9%), Germany (8%), the U.K. (4%) and The Netherlands
    (3%). These facilities are considered to be suitable and
    adequate for their operations. Management believes we can meet
    the expected demand increase over the near term with our
    existing facilities, especially given our operational
    improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity. The
    Company’s executive office occupies approximately
    26,000 square feet of leased space in Northbrook, Illinois.

Approximately 3.0 million square feet (75%) of the
    principal plant and office floor area is owned by the Company,
    and the balance is held under lease. Approximately
    1.8 million square feet (45%) of the principal plant and
    office floor area is held by business units in the
    Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment;
    0.8 million square feet (19%) is held by business units in
    the Health & Science Technologies Segment;
    0.6 million square feet (15%) is held by business units in
    the Dispensing Equipment Segment; and 0.7 million square
    feet (18%) is held by business units in the Fire &
    Safety/Diversified Products Segment.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings.

The Company and five of its subsidiaries have been named as
    defendants in a number of lawsuits claiming various
    asbestos-related personal injuries, allegedly as a result of
    exposure to products manufactured with components that contained
    asbestos. Such components were acquired from third party
    suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of the subsidiaries.
    To date, the majority of the Company’s settlements and
    legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration,
    insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have
    been covered in full by insurance subject to applicable
    deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to
    what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover
    such settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to
    claims that are tendered to them.

Claims have been filed in Alabama, Arizona, California,
    Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,
    Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
    Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
    New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
    Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington,
    West Virginia and Wyoming. Most of the claims resolved to date
    have been dismissed without payment. The balance have been
    settled for various insignificant amounts. Only one case has
    been tried, resulting in a verdict for the Company’s
    business unit.

No provision has been made in the financial statements of the
    Company, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary
    course, and the Company does not currently believe the
    asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s business, financial position, results of
    operations or cash flow.

The Company is also party to various other legal proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which is
    expected to have a material adverse effect on its business,
    financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

On April 21, 2008, IDEX’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $125.0 million of its
    outstanding common shares either in the open market or through
    private transactions.



The following table compares total shareholder returns over the
    last five years to the Standard & Poor’s (the
    “S&P”) 500 Index, the S&P 600 Small Cap
    Industrial Machinery Index and the Russell 2000 Index assuming
    the value of the investment in IDEX Common Stock and each index

Results
    of Operations

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial
    position and results of operations for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2008. For purposes of this
    discussion and analysis section, reference is made to the table
    on page 17 and the Consolidated Statements of Operations in
    Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data on page 27.

In 2006, the Company sold Lubriquip, its lubricant dispensing
    business that operated as part of the Company’s Dispensing
    Equipment Segment. In 2007, the Company sold Halox, its chemical
    and electrochemical systems



product line operating as part of Pulsafeeder in the
    Company’s Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment.
    Financial information for 2006 and 2007 has been restated to
    present the operating results of Lubriquip and Halox as
    discontinued operations.

Performance
    in 2008 Compared with 2007

Sales in 2008 of $1,489.5 million were 10% higher than the
    $1,358.6 million recorded a year ago. Seven acquisitions
    (Quadro — June 2007, Isolation
    Technologies — October 2007, ADS — January
    2008, Richter — October 2008, iPEK — October
    2008, IETG — October 2008 and Semrock —
    October 2008) made since 2007 accounted for an improvement
    of 9%, foreign currency translation accounted for 1%, while
    organic sales were flat. Organic sales increased in the
    Fluid & Metering Technologies and Fire &
    Safety/Diversified Products segments, but were down in the
    Health & Science Technologies and Dispensing Equipment
    segments. Domestic organic sales were down 3% versus the prior
    year, while international organic sales were up 4% over the
    prior year. Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented
    47% of total sales in 2008 and 46% in 2007.

In 2008, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 47%
    of sales and 51% of operating income; Health & Science
    Technologies accounted for 22% of sales and 24% of operating
    income; Dispensing Equipment accounted for 11% of sales and (4)%
    of operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified
    Products represented 20% of sales and 29% of operating income.

Fluid & Metering Technologies sales of
    $697.7 million in 2008 rose $127.4 million, or 22%,
    compared with 2007. The acquisition of Quadro, ADS, Richter,
    iPEK and IETG accounted for 18% of the increase, while organic
    growth increased 4%. In 2008, organic sales grew approximately
    2% domestically and 6% internationally. Sales to customers
    outside the U.S. were approximately 41% of total segment
    sales in 2008 and 42% in 2007.

Health & Science Technologies sales of
    $331.6 million increased $4.4 million, or 1%, in 2008
    compared with last year. The acquisition of Isolation
    Technologies and Semrock accounted for 4% of the increase
    partially offset by a 3% decrease in organic volume. In 2008,
    organic sales decreased 2% domestically and 5% internationally.
    Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 39%
    of total segment sales in 2008 and 2007.

Dispensing Equipment sales of $163.9 million decreased
    $14.1 million, or 8%, in 2008 compared with the prior year.
    Organic sales decreased 13%, while foreign currency translation
    accounted for an increase of 5%. Organic domestic sales
    decreased 35% compared with 2007, while organic international
    sales were essentially flat. Sales to customers outside the
    U.S. were 74% of total segment sales in 2008, up from 63%
    in 2007.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products sales of
    $300.5 million increased $12.0 million, or 4%, in 2008
    compared with 2007. Organic sales activity increased 3%, while
    foreign currency translation accounted for 1%. In 2008, organic
    sales decreased 4% domestically, while organic international
    sales increased 11%. Sales to customers outside the
    U.S. were 54% of total segment sales in 2008 and 49% in
    2007.

Gross profit of $603.9 million in 2008 was
    $35.5 million, or 6%, higher than 2007. As a percent of
    sales, gross profit was 40.5% in 2008, which represented a 130
    basis-point decrease from 41.8% in 2007. The decrease in gross
    margin primarily reflects product mix, higher material costs and
    the effect from recent acquisitions.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses
    increased to $343.4 million in 2008 from
    $313.4 million in 2007. This increase primarily relates to
    our recent acquisitions. As a percent of net sales, SG&A
    expenses were 23.0% for both 2008 and 2007.

In 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses
    totaling $18.0 million. These restructuring expenses were
    related to the Company’s restructuring program to support
    the implementation of key strategic initiatives designed to
    achieve long-term sustainable growth, which includes the
    previously announced cessation of manufacturing operations in
    its Dispensing Equipment segment’s Milan, Italy facility.
    The plant closure is expected to improve operating productivity
    and enhance capacity utilization. The Company has substantially
    completed company-wide plans which include management and
    administrative workforce reductions as well as an additional
    facility consolidation. Employees separated or to be separated
    from the Company as a result of these initiatives were offered
    severance packages, as appropriate. The expenses recorded in
    2008 included costs related to involuntary terminations and
    other direct costs associated with implementing these
    initiatives.



In 2008, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company
    concluded that events had occurred and circumstances had changed
    which required the Company to perform an interim period goodwill
    impairment test at Fluid Management Americas, a reporting unit
    within the Company’s Dispensing Equipment Segment. Fluid
    Management Americas has experienced a downturn in capital
    spending by its customer base and the loss of market share. As a
    result, the Company performed an impairment test and compared
    the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. It
    was determined that the fair value of Fluid Management Americas
    was less than the carrying value of the net assets. The excess
    of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts
    assigned to its assets and liabilities was the implied fair
    value of goodwill. The Company’s analysis resulted in an
    implied fair value of goodwill of $21.2 million, and as a
    result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of
    $30.1 million in 2008.

Since October 31, 2008, the date of our annual impairment
    test, the Company has updated certain forecasts to reflect,
    among other things, the global economic downturn and other
    considerations. Because of these changes in circumstances, as of
    December 31, 2008 the Company has reassessed the likelihood
    of any further impairment of our reporting units. No goodwill
    impairments were identified. However, further changes in our
    forecasts or changes in key assumptions could cause book values
    of certain reporting units to exceed their fair values which
    would potentially result in goodwill impairment charges in
    future periods. Except for two of our reporting units within the
    Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, a 10% decrease
    in the fair value of our reporting units would not result in
    goodwill impairment based on carrying values at
    December 31, 2008. The two reporting units which could
    potentially result in a goodwill impairment if a 10% decrease in
    fair value were realized have a total goodwill balance of
    $204.2 million.

Operating income decreased $42.7 million, or 17%, to
    $212.4 million in 2008 from the $255.1 million in
    2007. This decrease was primarily due to the $18.0 million
    of restructuring-related charges and $30.1 million for the
    goodwill impairment charge, offset by a net amount of $5.4
    million related to  the favorable effect of 2008 acquisitions
    and other inflationary increases in costs. Operating margins in
    2008 were 14.3% of sales compared with 18.8% in 2007. The
    decrease in operating margins was primarily due to the impact of
    the previously announced restructuring-related and goodwill
    impairment charges, as well as expenses associated with recent
    acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in volume.

In the Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment,
    operating income of $129.4 million in 2008 was up from the
    $121.4 million recorded in 2007 principally due to
    increased volume, partially offset by the restructuring-related
    charges. Operating margins for Fluid & Metering
    Technologies of 18.5% in 2008 were down from 21.3% in 2007,
    primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and the
    restructuring-related charges. In the Health & Science
    Technologies Segment, operating income of $59.7 million and
    operating margins of 18.0% in 2008 were down from the
    $60.9 million and 18.6% recorded in 2007, principally due
    to recent acquisitions and the restructuring-related charges. In
    the Dispensing Equipment Segment, an operating loss of
    $10.6 million and operating margins of (6.5)% in 2008 were
    down from the $39.4 million and 22.1% recorded in 2007, due
    to lower volume as a result of continued deterioration in
    capital spending for both North American and European markets,
    the restructuring-related and goodwill impairment charges and
    selective material cost increases. Operating income and
    operating margins in the Fire & Safety/Diversified
    Products Segment of $73.7 million and 24.5%, respectively,
    were higher than the $66.5 million and 23.1% recorded in
    2007, due primarily to favorable product mix, partially offset
    by restructuring-related charges.

Other income of $5.1 million in 2008 was $1.7 million
    higher than the $3.4 million in 2007, due to favorable
    foreign currency translation and higher interest income.

Interest expense decreased to $18.9 million in 2008 from
    $23.4 million in 2007. The decrease was due to a lower
    interest rate environment, the refinancing of the
    $150.0 million senior notes to a lower interest rate and
    the conversion of floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt.

The provision for income taxes decreased to $67.3 million
    in 2008 from $79.3 million in 2007. The effective tax rate
    increased to 33.9% in 2008 from 33.7% in 2007, due to changes in
    the mix of global pre-tax income among taxing jurisdictions.

Income from continuing operations in 2008 was
    $131.4 million, 16% lower than the $155.9 million
    earned in 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations in 2008 of $1.60 decreased $0.30, or 16%, compared
    with the same period of 2007.

Loss from discontinued operations in 2007 was $0.7 million
    or $0.01 per share, which resulted from operations for Halox.
    The 2007 loss includes $0.7 million loss from operations
    and a $0.1 million loss from the sale of Halox, offset by a
    $0.1 million income adjustment from the sale of Lubriquip.

Net income for 2008 was $131.4 million, 15% lower than the
    $155.1 million earned in the same period of 2007. Diluted
    earnings per share in 2008 of $1.60 decreased $0.29, or 15%,
    compared with the same period last year.

Performance
    in 2007 Compared with 2006

In 2006, the Company sold Lubriquip, its lubricant dispensing
    business that operated as part of the Company’s Dispensing
    Equipment Segment. In 2007, the Company sold Halox, its chemical
    and electrochemical systems product line operating as part of
    Pulsafeeder in the Company’s Fluid & Metering
    Technologies Segment. Financial information for all periods
    presented has been restated to present the operating results of
    both Lubriquip and Halox as a discontinued operation.

Sales in 2007 of $1,358.6 million were 18% higher than the
    $1,154.9 million recorded a year ago. Organic sales rose
    6%, seven acquisitions (JUN-AIR — February 2006;
    Eastern Plastics — May 2006; Banjo — October
    2006; Toptech — December 2006; Faure
    Herman — February 2007; Quadro — June 2007
    and Isolation Technologies — October 2007) made
    since the beginning of 2006 accounted for an improvement of 9%,
    while foreign currency translation accounted for 3%. Organic
    sales increased in all four of the Company’s reporting
    segments. Both domestic and international organic sales were up
    over 6% versus the prior year. Sales to customers outside the
    U.S. represented 46% of total sales in 2007 and 45% in 2006.

In 2007, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 42%
    of sales and operating income; Health & Science
    Technologies accounted for 24% of sales and 21% of operating
    income; Dispensing Equipment accounted for 13% of sales and 14%
    of operating income; and Fire & Safety/Diversified
    Products represented 21% of sales and 23% of operating income.

Fluid & Metering Technologies sales of
    $570.3 million in 2007 rose $134.8 million, or 31%,
    compared with 2006. The acquisition of Quadro, Faure Herman,
    Toptech and Banjo accounted for 20% of the increase, organic
    growth increased 9%, while foreign currency translation
    accounted for 2%. In 2007, organic sales grew approximately 7%
    domestically and 13% internationally. Sales to customers outside
    the U.S. were approximately 42% of total segment sales in
    2007 and 41% in 2006.

Health & Science Technologies sales of
    $327.2 million increased $22.3 million, or 7%, in 2007
    compared with last year. The acquisition of Isolation
    Technologies, EPI and JUN-AIR accounted for 6% of the increase
    while organic volume contributed 1%. In 2007, organic sales
    increased 3% domestically and decreased 1% internationally.
    Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 39%
    of total segment sales in 2007 and 2006.



Dispensing Equipment sales of $177.9 million increased
    $18.2 million, or 11%, in 2007 compared with the prior
    year. Organic sales increased 6%, while foreign currency
    translation accounted for 5%. Organic domestic sales increased
    17% compared with 2006, while organic international sales were
    essentially flat. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were
    63% of total segment sales in 2007, down from 65% in 2006.

Fire & Safety/Diversified Products sales of
    $288.4 million increased $28.3 million, or 11%, in
    2007 compared with 2006. Organic sales activity increased 7%,
    while foreign currency translation accounted for 4%. In 2007,
    organic sales increased 4% domestically, while organic
    international sales increased 10%. Sales to customers outside
    the U.S. were 49% of total segment sales in 2007 and 46% in
    2006.

Gross profit of $568.4 million in 2007 was
    $91.0 million, or 19%, higher than 2006. As a percent of
    sales, gross profit was 41.8% in 2007, which represented a 50
    basis-point increase from 41.3% in 2006. The improved gross
    profit margin is primarily attributable to strategic sourcing
    and other operational excellence initiatives.

SG&A expenses increased to $313.4 million in 2007 from
    $260.2 million in 2006. This increase reflects
    $33.1 million for acquisitions, $16.1 million of
    volume-related expenses, and a $1.7 million increase from
    severance-related and field service expenses as well as a
    $2.3 million increase from bad debt expense associated with
    the bankruptcy of a fire suppression customer. As a percent of
    net sales, SG&A expenses were 23.0%, an increase of
    50 basis points compared with the 22.5% achieved in 2006.

Operating income increased $37.9 million, or 17%, to
    $255.1 million in 2007 from $217.2 million in 2006,
    primarily due to higher 2007 gross profit, offset by
    increased SG&A expenses. Operating margins in 2007 were
    18.8% of sales, flat with the prior year. Operating margin
    improvement was offset by the impact of acquisitions, foreign
    currency translation and severance-related and field service
    expenses as well as bad debt expense associated with the
    bankruptcy of a fire suppression customer.

In the Fluid & Metering Technologies Segment,
    operating income of $121.4 million and operating margins of
    21.3% in 2007 were up from the $89.9 million and 20.6%
    recorded in 2006 principally due to the impact of acquisitions,
    foreign currency translation and increased volume. Operating
    income for the Health & Science Technologies Segment
    of $60.9 million was up from the $58.2 million
    recorded in 2006 principally due to volume. Operating margins
    for Health & Science Technologies of 18.6% in 2007
    were down from 19.1% in 2006, primarily due to product mix and
    severance-related expenses. Operating income for the Dispensing
    Equipment Segment of $39.4 million was up slightly from the
    $38.0 million recorded in 2006, principally due to improved
    market conditions in Europe and the impact of our operational
    excellence initiatives. Operating margins for Dispensing
    Equipment of 22.1% in 2007 were down from 23.8% in 2006,
    primarily due to foreign currency translation and
    severance-related and field service expenses. Operating income
    in the Fire & Safety/Diversified Products Segment of
    $66.5 million was higher than the $62.7 million
    recorded in 2006, primarily due to increased volume. Operating
    margins within Fire & Safety/Diversified Products of
    23.1% in 2007 was down from 24.1% in 2006, primarily due to
    severance-related and bad debt expenses.

Other income of $3.4 million in 2007 was $2.4 million
    higher than the $1.0 million in 2006, due to favorable
    foreign currency translation and higher interest income.

Interest expense increased to $23.4 million in 2007 from
    $16.4 million in 2006. The increase was principally due to
    higher debt levels as a result of acquisitions.

The provision for income taxes increased to $79.3 million
    in 2007 from $68.2 million in 2006. The effective tax rate
    decreased to 33.7% in 2007 from 33.8% in 2006, due to changes in
    the mix of global pre-tax income among taxing jurisdictions.

Income from continuing operations in 2007 was
    $155.9 million, 17% higher than the $133.7 million
    earned in 2006. Diluted earnings per share from continuing
    operations in 2007 of $1.90 increased $0.25, or 15%, compared
    with the same period of 2006.

Loss from discontinued operations in 2007 was $0.7 million,
    or $0.01 per share, compared to income from discontinued
    operations of $12.9 million, or $0.16 per share, in the
    comparable period of 2006. The 2007 loss includes
    $0.7 million loss from operations and a $0.1 million
    loss from the sale of Halox, offset by a $0.1 million
    income adjustment from the sale of Lubriquip. The 2006 income
    from discontinued operations includes an after tax



gain of $16.7 million from the sale of Lubriquip and
    $0.3 million of income from operations, partially offset by
    a $4.1 million loss from the write-down of the carrying
    value of Halox to its estimated fair market value.

Net income in 2007 was $155.1 million, 6% higher than the
    $146.7 million earned in the same period of 2006. Diluted
    earnings per share in 2007 of $1.89, increased $0.08, or 4%,
    compared with the same period last year.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

At December 31, 2008, working capital was
    $286.0 million and the Company’s current ratio was 2.3
    to 1. Cash flows from operating activities of continuing
    operations increased $26.0 million, or 13%, to
    $224.1 million in 2008.

Cash flows from continuing operations were more than adequate to
    fund capital expenditures of $27.8 million and
    $24.5 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital
    expenditures were generally for machinery and equipment that
    improved productivity and tooling to support the global sourcing
    initiatives, although a portion was for business system
    technology and replacement of equipment and facilities.
    Management believes that the Company has ample capacity in its
    plants and equipment to meet expected needs for future growth in
    the intermediate term.

The Company acquired ADS in January 2008 for cash consideration
    of $156.4 million, Richter in October 2008 for cash
    consideration of $93.4 million and the assumption of
    approximately $8.6 million in debt related items and
    $0.1 million in debt, iPEK in October 2008 for cash
    consideration of $43.3 million and the assumption of
    approximately $1.4 million in debt related items, IETG in
    October 2008 for cash consideration of $35.5 million and
    the assumption of approximately $1.9 million in debt
    related items, Semrock in October 2008 for cash consideration of
    $60.9 million and the assumption of approximately
    $0.2 million in debt related items and Innovadyne
    Technologies, Inc (“Innovadyne”) for cash
    consideration of $3.7 million. Approximately
    $155.0 million of the cash payment for ADS was financed by
    borrowings under the Company’s credit Facility, of which
    $140.0 million was reflected as restricted cash at
    December 31, 2007. Approximately $63.7 million,
    $33.2 million, $20.5 million, $60.0 million and
    $3.3 million of the cash payments for the acquisitions of
    Richter, iPEK, IETG, Semrock and Innovadyne, respectively, were
    financed by borrowings under the Company’s credit facility.

The Company acquired Faure Herman in February 2007 for cash
    consideration of $24.3 million and the assumption of
    approximately $1.6 million in debt, Quadro in June 2007 for
    cash consideration of $32.0 million and Isolation
    Technologies in October 2007 for cash consideration of
    $30.2 million. Approximately $12.9 million,
    $11.3 million and $29.9 million of the cash payments
    for the acquisitions of Faure Herman, Quadro and Isolation
    Technologies, respectively, were financed by borrowings under
    the Company’s credit facility.

The Company maintains a $600.0 million unsecured domestic,
    multi-currency bank revolving credit facility (“Credit
    Facility”), which expires on December 21, 2011. In
    2008, the Credit Facility was amended to allow the Company to
    designate certain foreign subsidiaries as designated borrowers.
    Upon approval from the lenders, the designated borrowers will be
    allowed to receive loans under the Credit Facility. A designated
    borrower sublimit was established as the lesser of the aggregate
    commitments or $100.0 million. As of the amendment date,
    Fluid Management Europe B.V., (FME) was approved by the lenders
    as a designated borrower. FME’s borrowings under the Credit
    Facility at year end were approximately $82.0 million (Euro
    58 million). As the FME borrowings under the Credit
    Facility are Euro denominated and the cash flows that will be
    used to make payments of principal and interest are
    predominately denominated in Euros, the Company does not
    anticipate any significant foreign exchange gains or losses in
    servicing this debt.

At December 31, 2008 there was $448.8 million
    outstanding under the Credit Facility and outstanding letters of
    credit totaled approximately $6.3 million. The net
    available borrowing under the Credit Facility as of
    December 31, 2008, was approximately $144.9 million.
    Interest is payable quarterly on the outstanding borrowings at
    the bank agent’s reference rate. Interest on borrowings
    based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin is payable on the
    maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective
    date for borrowings exceeding three months. The applicable
    margin is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured,
    long-term debt rating and can range from 24 basis points to
    50 basis points. Based on the Company’s BBB rating at
    December 31, 2008, the applicable margin was 40 basis
    points. An annual Credit Facility fee, also based on the
    Company’s credit rating, is currently 10 basis points
    and is payable quarterly. In 2008 the Company entered into two
    interest rate exchange agreements. One interest rate exchange
    agreement, expiring in January 2011, effectively converted
    $250.0 million of floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt
    at



an interest rate of 3.25%. The second interest rate exchange
    agreement, expiring December 21, 2011, effectively
    converted an additional $100.0 million of floating-rate
    debt into fixed-rate debt at an interest rate of 4.00%.

There are two financial covenants that the Company is required
    to maintain. As defined in the agreement, the minimum interest
    coverage ratio (operating cash flow to interest) is 3.0 to 1 and
    the maximum leverage ratio (outstanding debt to operating cash
    flow) is 3.25 to 1. At December 31, 2008, the Company was
    in compliance with both of these financial covenants.

On February 15, 2008, the Company retired its
    $150.0 million senior notes using proceeds available under
    the Company’s Credit Facility.

On April 18, 2008, the Company completed a
    $100.0 million senior bank term loan agreement (“Term
    Loan”) with covenants consistent with the existing Credit
    Facility and a maturity on December 21, 2011. At
    December 31, 2008, there was $100.0 million
    outstanding under the Term Loan with $5.0 million included
    within short-term borrowings. Interest under the Term Loan is
    based on the bank agent’s reference rate or LIBOR plus an
    applicable margin and is payable at the end of the selected
    interest period, but at least quarterly. The applicable margin
    is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt
    rating and can range from 45 to 100 basis points. Based on
    the Company’s current debt rating, the applicable margin is
    80 basis points. The Term Loan requires repayments of
    $5.0 million, $5.0 million and $7.5 million in
    April of 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively, with the remaining
    balance due on December 21, 2011. The Company used the
    proceeds from the Term Loan to pay down existing debt
    outstanding under the Credit Facility.

On April 21, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $125.0 million of its
    outstanding common shares. Repurchases under the new program
    will be funded with cash flow generation, and made from time to
    time in either the open market or through private transactions.
    The timing, volume, and nature of share repurchases will be at
    the discretion of management, dependent on market conditions,
    other priorities for cash investment, applicable securities
    laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at
    any time. As of December 31, 2008, 2.3 million shares
    were purchased at a cost of $50.0 million.

Despite the current downturn in global financial markets, the
    Company has not experienced any liquidity issues and we continue
    to expect that our current liquidity, notwithstanding these
    adverse market conditions, will be sufficient to meet our
    operating requirements, interest on all borrowings, required
    debt repayments, any authorized share repurchases, planned
    capital expenditures, and annual dividend payments to holders of
    common stock during the next twelve months. In the event that
    suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon terms
    acceptable to the Board of Directors, we may obtain all or a
    portion of the financing for the acquisitions through the
    incurrence of additional long-term borrowings. However, in light
    of recent adverse events in global financial and economic
    conditions, we cannot be certain that additional financing will
    be available on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Contractual
    Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include
    rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital
    leases, and other long-term obligations arising in the ordinary
    course of business. There are no identifiable events or
    uncertainties, including the lowering of our credit rating that
    would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments
    or obligations. The Company also has obligations with respect to
    its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, which are
    not included in the table below. See Note 16 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II.
    Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
    additional detail related to pension and postretirement medical
    benefit plans.

The following table summarizes our significant contractual
    obligations and commercial commitments at December 31,
    2008, and the future periods in which such obligations are
    expected to be settled in cash. In addition, the table reflects
    the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding
    borrowings. Additional detail



regarding these obligations is provided in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

We believe that the application of the following accounting
    policies, which are important to our financial position and
    results of operations, requires significant judgments and
    estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of our
    accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed
    below, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data.

Revenue recognition

— The Company
    recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or
    determinable, and collectibility of the sales price is
    reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur
    until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been
    transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized
    when the services are provided or ratably over the contract
    term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple
    deliverables, including the combination of products and
    services. In such cases the Company has identified these as
    separate elements in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” and
    recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate
    element based on the fair value of each accounting unit.
    Revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the
    percentage-of-completion method. Percentage-of-completion is
    measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date
    for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract
    at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
    long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses
    are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation
    process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs,
    including those arising from contract penalty provisions and
    final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term.
    Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period
    in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns
    and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of
    revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on
    historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers
    product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for
    warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the
    warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related
    information known to the Company.

Share-Based Compensation

— The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 123(R), “Share Based Payment”
    effective January 1, 2006, and applies the Binomial lattice
    option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options. The
    Binomial lattice option-pricing model incorporates certain
    assumptions, such as the expected volatility, risk-free interest
    rate, expected dividend yield and expected life of options, in
    order to arrive at a fair value estimate. As a result,
    share-based compensation expense, as calculated and recorded
    under SFAS No. 123(R), could have been



impacted if other assumptions were used. Furthermore, if the
    Company used different assumptions in future periods,
    share-based compensation expense could be impacted in future
    periods. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements
    and Supplementary Data for additional information.

Inventory

— The Company states inventory at the
    lower of cost or market. Cost includes material, labor and
    overhead and is determined by the

last-in,

first-out basis or

first-in,

first-out basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of
    inventory to its net realizable value, if required, at the
    business unit level for estimated excess, obsolescence or
    impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include
    changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering
    changes.

Goodwill, Long-Lived and Intangible assets

—
    The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent
    assets utilizing various estimation processes. An impairment of
    a long-lived asset exists when the asset’s carrying amount
    exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount
    is not recoverable through future operations. An intangible
    asset or goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of
    intangible assets and goodwill exceeds its fair value.
    Assessments of possible impairments of goodwill, long-lived or
    intangible assets are made when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may
    not be recoverable through future operations. Additionally,
    testing for possible impairment of recorded goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible asset balances is performed
    annually. The amount and timing of impairment charges for these
    assets require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair
    market value of the related assets.

Income taxes

— The Company accounts for income
    taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under
    SFAS No. 109, deferred income tax assets and
    liabilities are determined based on the estimated future tax
    effects of differences between the financial statement and tax
    bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax
    laws. The Company’s tax balances are based on
    management’s interpretation of the tax regulations and
    rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Future tax authority
    rulings and changes in tax laws and future tax planning
    strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax
    balances recorded by the Company.

Contingencies and litigation —

We are currently
    involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings and, as
    required and where it is reasonably possible to do so, we accrue
    estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these
    matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with
    outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential
    results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement
    strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating
    results for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
    materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the
    effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.

Defined benefit retirement plans

— The plan
    obligations and related assets of the defined benefit retirement
    plans are presented in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements in Part II. Item 8. Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data. Plan assets, which consist
    primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments, are valued
    using market quotations. Plan obligations and the annual pension
    expense are determined by consulting with actuaries using a
    number of assumptions provided by the Company. Key assumptions
    in the determination of the annual pension expense include the
    discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and the estimated
    future return on plan assets. To the extent actual amounts
    differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts, results
    could be adversely affected.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141(R) (revised
    2007), “Business Combinations,” which replaces
    SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes
    principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business
    combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements,
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
    any controlling interest; recognizes and measures the goodwill
    acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain
    purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable
    users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is to be applied prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
    December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt this statement
    for acquisitions consummated after its effective date.



In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for
    the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Minority interests will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. It also establishes a single method of
    accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in
    a subsidiary and requires expanded disclosures.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this
    standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

In February 2008, FASB issued a FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”) to allow a one-year deferral of adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and
    non-financial liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a
    nonrecurring basis. The Company will adopt the FSP on
    January 1, 2009 and we expect the adoption to have an
    immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 133.” SFAS No. 161 is intended to
    improve financial standards for derivative instruments and
    hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable
    investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
    Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about:
    (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related
    interpretations; and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2008, with early adoption
    encouraged. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 161 on its financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” FSP

No. 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.” FSP

No. 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The implementation of this standard will not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF

No. 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” Under
    EITF

No. 03-6-1,

unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to
    receive nonforfeitable dividends (whether paid or unpaid) are
    participating securities, and should be included in the
    two-class method of computing EPS. EITF

No. 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those years. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of EITF

No. 03-6-1

on its financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active.” FSP

No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which the
    Company adopted as of January 1, 2008, in cases where a
    market is not active. The Company has considered the guidance
    provided by FSP

No. 157-3

in its determination of estimated fair values as of
    December 31, 2008, and the impact was not material.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We may, from
    time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and
    interest rate exchange agreements on our debt when we believe
    there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk
    management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes
    the procedures and controls over derivative financial and
    commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward
    contracts and interest rate exchange agreements. Under the
    policy, we do not use derivative financial or commodity
    instruments for trading purposes, and the use of these
    instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers.
    Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to
    foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate exchange
    agreements on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt. The
    Company’s exposure related to derivative instruments is, in
    the aggregate, not material to its financial position, results
    of operations, or cash flows.



The Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is
    limited principally to the Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar
    and Chinese Renminbi. We manage our foreign exchange risk
    principally through invoicing our customers in the same currency
    as the source of our products. The effect of transaction gains
    and losses is reported within “Other

income-net”

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At
    December 31, 2008 the Company had foreign currency
    contracts with an aggregate notional amount of
    $13.4 million.

The Company’s interest rate exposure was primarily related
    to the $554.0 million of total debt outstanding at
    December 31, 2008. The majority of the debt was priced at
    interest rates that float with the market. In order to mitigate
    this interest exposure, the Company entered into interest rate
    exchange agreements that effectively converted
    $350.0 million of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate. A
    50-basis point movement in the interest rate on the remaining
    $204.0 million floating-rate debt would result in an
    approximate $1.0 million annualized increase or decrease in
    interest expense and cash flows.

IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Business

IDEX Corporation (“IDEX” or the “Company”)
    is an applied solutions company specializing in fluid and
    metering technologies, health and science technologies,
    dispensing equipment, and fire, safety and other diversified
    products built to its customers’ specifications. Its
    products are sold in niche markets to a wide range of industries
    throughout the world. Our products include industrial pumps,
    compressors, flow meters, injectors and valves, and related
    controls for use in a wide variety of process applications;
    precision fluidics solutions, including pumps, valves, degassing
    equipment, corrective tubing, fittings, and complex manifolds,
    as well as specialty medical equipment and devices used in life
    science applications; precision-engineered equipment for
    dispensing, metering and mixing paints, and personal care
    products; refinishing equipment; and engineered products for
    industrial and commercial markets, including fire and rescue,
    transportation equipment, oil and gas, electronics, and
    communications. These activities are grouped into four business
    segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies,
    Health & Science Technologies, Dispensing Equipment,
    and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the Company and
    its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts
    have been eliminated.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported
    amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal
    areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are
    sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts,
    inventory, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and
    intangible assets, income taxes, product warranties,
    derivatives, contingencies and litigation, share-based
    compensation and defined benefit retirement plans.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is
    fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the sales price is
    reasonably assured. For product sales, delivery does not occur
    until the products have been shipped and risk of loss has been
    transferred to the customer. Revenue from services is recognized
    when the services are provided or ratably over the contract
    term. Some arrangements with customers may include multiple
    deliverables, including the combination of products and
    services. In such cases the Company has identified these as
    separate elements in accordance with EITF

No. 00-21,

“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” and
    recognizes revenue consistent with the policy for each separate
    element based on the fair value of each accounting unit.
    Revenues from certain long-term contracts are recognized on the
    percentage-of-completion method. Percentage-of-completion is
    measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date
    for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract
    at completion. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted
    long-term contracts are made in the period in which such losses
    are determined. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation
    process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs,
    including those arising from contract penalty provisions and
    final contract settlements, will be revised in the near-term.
    Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period
    in which the revisions are determined.

The Company records allowances for discounts, product returns
    and customer incentives at the time of sale as a reduction of
    revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on
    historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers
    product warranties and accrues its estimated exposure for
    warranty claims at the time of



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty
    costs incurred and any other related information known to the
    Company.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
    purchased with an original maturity of three or fewer months to
    be cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted
    Cash

On December 31, 2007, the Company deposited cash in an
    escrow account in accordance with the planned acquisition of
    ADS, which took place on January 1, 2008 (see Note 13).

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost,
    which includes material, labor and factory overhead, is
    determined on the

first-in,

first-out basis or the

last-in,

first-out basis. A reserve for excess inventory is recorded for
    inventory on hand in excess of anticipated or historical usage.
    An obsolescence reserve is recorded for inventory made obsolete
    by marketplace, product or engineering changes.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the
    occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate
    that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, as
    measured by comparing their net book value to the projected
    undiscounted future cash flows generated by their use. Impaired
    assets are recorded at their estimated fair value using a
    discounted cash flow analysis.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets annually on
    October 31st, or upon the occurrence of events or changes
    in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the
    goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable, in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” The Company evaluates the
    recoverability of each of these assets based on the estimated
    fair value of each reporting unit and the estimated future cash
    flows from each of the reporting units. See Note 4 for a
    further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.

Borrowing
    Expenses

Expenses incurred in securing and issuing debt are amortized
    over the life of the related borrowing and are included in
    Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Earnings
    per Common Share

Earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by
    dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of
    common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents and unvested
    shares (diluted) outstanding during the year. Common stock
    equivalents consist of stock options and deferred compensation
    units (“DCUs”) and have been included in the
    calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the
    treasury stock method.

Options to purchase approximately 3.3 million,
    1.7 million and 1.8 million shares of common stock as
    of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were not
    included in the computation of diluted EPS because the exercise
    price was greater than the average market price of the
    Company’s common stock and, therefore, the effect of their
    inclusion would have been antidilutive.

Stock
    Options

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) using
    the modified prospective method, and thus did not restate any
    prior period amounts. Under this method, compensation cost in
    the twelve months ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
    includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all
    share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of
    December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in
    accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 and (2) all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant
    date fair value estimated using the Binomial lattice
    option-pricing model. The Company recognizes these compensation
    costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
    of the award, which is generally the option vesting period of
    four years. See Note 15 for a further discussion on
    share-based compensation.

Depreciation
    and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and
    amortization provided using the straight-line method over the
    following estimated useful lives:

Land improvements

Foreign
    Currency Translation

The functional currency of substantially all operations outside
    the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly,
    those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been
    translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance
    sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using
    the average exchange rate for the year. The gains and losses
    resulting from changes in exchange rates from year to year have
    been reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss)” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effect of
    transaction gains and losses is reported within “Other

on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial
    instruments, including cash, trade receivables, accounts
    payable, accrued expenses and borrowings approximate their fair
    values.

Concentration

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R)
    (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”, which
    replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R)
    establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a
    business combination recognizes and measures in its financial
    statements, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
    assumed, and any controlling interest; recognizes and measures
    the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from
    a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose
    to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the
    nature and financial effects of the business combination.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is to be applied prospectively to
    business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or
    after an entity’s fiscal year that begins after
    December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt this statement
    for acquisitions consummated after its effective date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51.”
    SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for
    the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Minority interests will be
    recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a
    component of equity. It also establishes a single method of
    accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in
    a subsidiary and requires expanded disclosures.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    on or after December 15, 2008. The implementation of this
    standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

In February 2008, FASB issued a FSP to allow a one-year deferral
    of adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets
    and non-financial liabilities that are recognized at fair value
    on a nonrecurring basis. The Company will adopt the FSP on
    January 1, 2009 and we expect the adoption to have an
    immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities — an amendment to FASB Statement
    No. 133.” SFAS No. 161 is intended to
    improve financial standards for derivative instruments and
    hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable
    investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s
    financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
    Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about:
    (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments;
    (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are
    accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related
    interpretations; and (c) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position,
    financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

after November 15, 2008, with early adoption encouraged.
    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
    SFAS No. 161 on its financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets.” FSP

No. 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.” FSP

No. 142-3

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The implementation of this standard will not have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF

No. 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” Under
    EITF

No. 03-6-1,

unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to
    receive nonforfeitable dividends (whether paid or unpaid) are
    participating securities, and should be included in the
    two-class method of computing EPS. EITF

No. 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008, and interim periods within those years. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of EITF

No. 03-6-1

on its financial statements.

In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active.” FSP

No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which the
    Company adopted as of January 1, 2008, in cases where a
    market is not active. The Company has considered the guidance
    provided by FSP

No. 157-3

in its determination of estimated fair values as of
    December 31, 2008, and the impact was not material.

2.

Restructuring

In 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses
    totaling $18.0 million following the accounting guidance of
    SFAS No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated
    with Exit or Disposal Activities.” These restructuring
    expenses, included in the line item “Restructuring
    expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations,
    were related to the Company’s restructuring program to
    support the implementation of key strategic initiatives designed
    to achieve long-term sustainable growth. The restructuring
    program includes the announced cessation of manufacturing
    operations in the Dispensing Equipment segment’s Milan,
    Italy facility. This plant closure is expected to improve
    operating productivity and enhance capacity utilization. In
    addition, the Company has initiated company-wide plans which
    include management and administrative workforce reductions as
    well as an additional facility consolidation. Employees
    separated or to be separated from the Company as a result of
    these initiatives were offered severance packages, as
    appropriate. The expenses recorded in 2008 included costs
    related to involuntary terminations and other direct costs
    associated with implementing these initiatives. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company has substantially completed
    the restructuring plans.

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets,” requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at
    the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual
    tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
    likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit
    below its carrying value. Goodwill represents the purchase price
    in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed.

In 2008 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company
    concluded that Fluid Management Americas, a reporting unit
    within the Company’s Dispensing Equipment segment
    experienced a downturn in capital spending by its customer base
    and the loss of market share which required the Company to
    perform an interim period goodwill impairment test.

The Company performed the first step of the two-step impairment
    test and compared the fair value of the reporting unit to its
    carrying value. Consistent with the Company’s approach in
    its annual impairment testing, in assessing the fair value of
    the Fluid Management Americas reporting unit, the Company
    considered both the market approach and income approach. Under
    the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is
    based on comparing the reporting unit to comparable publicly
    traded companies or comparable entities which have been recently
    acquired in arms-length transactions. Under the income approach,
    the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present
    value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is
    dependent on a number of significant management assumptions
    including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures,
    other operating costs and discount rates. Due to current
    conditions within the market and the specific reporting unit,
    weighting was equally attributed to both the market and income
    approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the
    reporting unit. The Company determined that the fair value of
    the Fluid Management Americas reporting unit was less than the
    carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, and thus
    the Company performed step two of the impairment test.

In step two of the impairment test, the Company determined the
    implied fair value of the goodwill and compared it to the
    carrying value of the goodwill. The Company allocated the
    current fair value of the Fluid Management Americas reporting
    unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting
    unit had presently been acquired in a business combination. The
    excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair
    value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied
    fair value of goodwill. The Company’s step two analysis
    resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of
    $21.2 million, and as a result, the Company recognized an
    impairment charge of $30.1 million in the third quarter of
    2008.

Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite
    lives were tested for impairment as of October 31, 2008.
    The Company concluded that the fair value of each of the
    reporting units was in excess of the carrying value as of
    October 31, 2008.

Since October 31, 2008, the date of our annual impairment
    test, the Company has updated certain forecasts to reflect,
    among other things, the global economic downturn and other
    considerations. Because of these changes in circumstances, as of
    December 31, 2008 the Company has reassessed the likelihood
    of any further impairment of our reporting units. No goodwill
    impairments were identified. However, further changes in our
    forecasts or changes in key assumptions could cause book values
    of certain reporting units to exceed their fair values which
    would potentially result in goodwill impairment charges in
    future periods. Except for two of our reporting units within the
    Fluid & Metering Technologies segment, a 10% decrease
    in the fair value of our reporting units would not result in
    goodwill impairment based on carrying values at
    December 31, 2008. The two reporting units which could
    potentially result in a goodwill impairment if a 10% decrease in
    fair value were realized have a total goodwill balance of
    $204.2 million.

    accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible

The Company maintains a $600.0 million unsecured domestic,
    multi-currency bank revolving credit facility (“Credit
    Facility”), which expires on December 21, 2011. In
    2008, the Credit Facility was amended to allow the Company to
    designate certain foreign subsidiaries as designated borrowers.
    Upon approval from the lenders, the designated borrowers will be
    allowed to receive loans under the Credit Facility. A designated
    borrower sublimit was established as the lesser of the aggregate
    commitments or $100.0 million. As of the amendment date,
    Fluid Management Europe B.V., (FME) was approved by the lenders
    as a designated borrower. FME’s borrowings under the Credit
    Facility at year end were approximately $82.0 million (Euro
    58 million). As the FME borrowings under the Credit
    Facility are Euro denominated and the cash flows that will be
    used to make payments of principal and interest are
    predominately denominated in Euros, the Company does not
    anticipate any significant foreign exchange gains or losses in
    servicing this debt.

At December 31, 2008 there was $448.8 million
    outstanding under the Credit Facility and outstanding letters of
    credit totaled approximately $6.3 million. The net
    available borrowing under the Credit Facility as of
    December 31, 2008, was approximately $144.9 million.
    Interest is payable quarterly on the outstanding borrowings at
    the bank agent’s reference rate. Interest on borrowings
    based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin is payable on the
    maturity date of the borrowing, or quarterly from the effective
    date for borrowings exceeding three months. The applicable
    margin is based on the Company’s senior, unsecured,
    long-term debt rating and can range from 24 basis points to
    50 basis points. Based on the Company’s BBB rating at
    December 31, 2008, the applicable margin was 40 basis
    points. An annual Credit Facility fee, also based on the
    Company’s credit rating, is currently 10 basis points
    and is payable quarterly. In 2008 the Company entered into two
    interest rate exchange agreements. One interest rate exchange
    agreement, expiring in January 2011, effectively converted
    $250.0 million of floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt
    at an interest rate of 3.25%. The second interest rate exchange
    agreement, expiring December 21, 2011, effectively
    converted an additional $100.0 million of floating-rate
    debt into fixed-rate debt at an interest rate of 4.00%.

On February 15, 2008, the Company retired its
    $150.0 million senior notes using proceeds available under
    the Company’s Credit Facility.

On April 18, 2008, the Company completed a $100.0 unsecured
    million senior bank term loan agreement (“Term Loan”)
    with covenants consistent with the existing Credit Facility and
    a maturity on December 21, 2011. At December 31, 2008,
    there was $100.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan
    with $5.0 million included within short-term borrowings.
    Interest under the Term Loan is based on the bank agent’s
    reference rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin and is payable
    at the end of the selected interest period, but at least
    quarterly. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s
    senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating and can range from 45
    to 100 basis points. Based on the Company’s current
    debt rating, the applicable margin is 80 basis points. The
    Term Loan requires repayments of $5.0 million,
    $5.0 million and $7.5 million in April of 2009, 2010,
    and 2011, respectively, with the remaining balance due on
    December 21, 2011. The Company used the proceeds from the
    Term Loan to pay down existing debt outstanding under the Credit
    Facility.

At December 31, 2008, other borrowings included capital
    leases as well as debt at international locations maintained for
    working capital purposes. Interest is payable on the outstanding
    debt balances at the international locations at rates ranging
    from 3.1% to 6.6% per annum.

There are two financial covenants that the Company is required
    to maintain in connection with the Credit Facility and Term
    Loan. As defined in the agreement, the minimum interest coverage
    ratio (operating cash flow to interest) is 3.0 to 1 and the
    maximum leverage ratio (outstanding debt to operating cash flow)
    is 3.25 to 1. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in
    compliance with both of these financial covenants.

Derivative
    Instruments

The Company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure
    to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The type
    of cash flow hedges the Company enters into includes foreign
    currency contracts and interest rate exchange agreements that
    effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to
    fixed-rate debt and are designed to reduce the impact of
    interest rate changes on future interest expense.

The effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate
    exchange agreements is reported in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity and
    reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in
    which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining
    gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present
    value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is
    recognized into net income during the period of change.

Fair values relating to derivative financial instruments reflect
    the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
    sell or buy the contracts based on quoted market prices of
    comparable contracts at each balance sheet date.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had two interest rate
    exchange agreements. The first interest rate exchange agreement,
    expiring in January 2011, effectively converted
    $250.0 million of floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt
    at an interest rate of 3.25%. The second interest rate exchange
    agreement, expiring in December 2011, effectively converted an
    additional $100.0 million of floating-rate debt into
    fixed-rate debt at an interest rate of 4.00%. The fair value of
    the two interest rate exchange agreements of $10.1 million
    was recorded as a non-current liability at December 31,
    2008.

The net gain recognized to net income for 2008 related to these
    cash flow hedges was immaterial. Based on interest rates at
    December 31, 2008, no significant portion of the amount
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2008 will be
    recognized to net income over the next 12 months as the
    underlying hedged transactions are realized.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had foreign currency
    exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of
    $13.4 million to manage its exposure to fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates. The change in fair market value
    of these contracts for 2008 was immaterial.

7.

Fair
    Value Measurements

The Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements,” on January 1, 2008, for our financial
    assets and financial liabilities. SFAS No. 157 defines
    fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and
    requires certain disclosures. SFAS No. 157 discusses
    valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
    market prices), the income approach (present value of future
    income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the
    service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The statement
    utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the



IDEX
    CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
    three broad levels. The following is a brief description of
    those three levels:

•

Level 1:

Observable inputs such as quoted
    prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities.

•

Level 2:

Inputs, other than quoted prices
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or
    liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or
    similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

•

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs that reflect
    the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

The following table summarizes the basis used to measure the
    Company’s financial assets at fair value on a recurring
    basis in the balance sheet:

In determining the fair value of the Company’s interest
    rate exchange agreement derivatives, the Company uses a present
    value of expected cash flows based on market observable interest
    rate yield curves commensurate with the term of each instrument
    and the credit default swap market to reflect the credit risk of
    either the Company or the counterparty.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

At December 31, 2008, total future minimum rental payments
    under noncancelable operating leases, primarily for office
    facilities, warehouses and data processing equipment, were
    $24.2 million. The future minimum rental commitments for
    each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:
    2009 — $9.3 million; 2010 —
    $6.3 million; 2011 — $4.2 million;
    2012 — $2.1 million; 2013 —
    $1.5 million; thereafter — $0.9 million.

Rental expense from continuing operations totaled
    $12.6 million, $11.6 million and $9.8 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings involving
    employment, contractual, product liability and other matters,
    none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on
    its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

9.

Common
    and Preferred Stock

All unvested shares carry dividend and voting rights, and the
    sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.

On April 21, 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $125.0 million of its
    outstanding common shares either in the open market or through
    private transactions. Since the inception of this program, the
    Company has purchased a total of 2.3 million shares at a
    cost of approximately $50.0 million.

On April 4, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized a three-for-two common stock split effected in the
    form of a 50% dividend payable on May 21, 2007, to
    shareholders of record on May 7, 2007. Par value of common
    stock remained at $.01 per share. All prior share and per share
    amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split.

The Company has not provided an estimate for any U.S. or
    additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign
    subsidiaries that might be payable if these earnings were
    repatriated since the Company considers these amounts to be
    permanently invested.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
    (“FIN 48”)” on January 1, 2007. In
    accordance with FIN No. 48, the Company recognized a
    cumulative-effect adjustment of $1.2 million, increasing
    its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and
    penalties and reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of
    retained earnings.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2008
    and December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    $0.9 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of
    accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. As of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had
    approximately $.2 million of accrued penalties related to
    uncertain tax positions.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect
    our effective tax rate if recognized is $3.1 million as of
    December 31, 2008 and $2.5 million as of
    December 31, 2007. The tax years

2004-2007

remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to
    the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign
    examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of
    limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s
    gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the
    next twelve months by a range of zero to $0.3 million.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had state net
    operating loss carry forwards of approximately
    $14.3 million and $19.6 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 the Company had foreign net
    operating loss carry forwards of approximately $9.7 million
    and $1.5 million, respectively. As of both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 the Company had a foreign
    capital loss carry forward of approximately $3.8 million.
    If unutilized, the state net operating loss will expire between
    2012 and 2027. Neither the foreign net operating loss nor the
    foreign capital loss has an expiration date. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded a
    valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset attributable
    to the state net operating loss of $0.4 million and
    $0.7 million, respectively. The Company has not recorded a
    valuation allowance against the foreign net operating loss at
    either December 31, 2008 or 2007. As of December 31,
    2008 the Company has a valuation allowance against the deferred
    tax asset attributable to the foreign capital loss of
    $1.1 million which remains unchanged from December 31,
    2007.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company maintains two share-based compensation plans for
    executives, non-employee directors, and certain key employees
    which authorize the granting of stock options, unvested shares,
    unvested share units, and other types of awards consistent with
    the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for
    issuance under the Company’s plans as of December 31,
    2008 totals 7.1 million, of which 2.6 million shares
    were available for future issuance. Stock options granted under
    these plans are generally non-qualified, and are granted with an
    exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s
    stock at the date of grant. Substantially all of the options
    issued to employees prior to 2005 become exercisable in five
    equal installments, while the majority of options issued to
    employees in 2005 and after become exercisable in four equal
    installments, beginning one year from the date of grant, and
    generally expire 10 years from the date of grant. Stock
    options granted to non-employee directors cliff vest after one
    or two years. Unvested share and unvested share unit awards
    generally cliff vest after three or four

years for employees, and three years for non-employee directors.
    The Company issued 583,000, 134,000 and 155,000 of unvested
    shares as compensation to key employees in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Of the shares granted in 2008, 242,800 of the
    shares vest 50% on April 8, 2011 and 50% on April 8,
    2013, but such vesting may be accelerated if the Company’s
    share price for any five consecutive trading days equals or
    exceeds $65.90 (twice the closing price of the shares on the
    date of grant). Also, 74,000 of the 2008 shares issued vest
    16.67% on April 8, 2009 and April 8, 2010,
    respectively, and the remaining 66.66% vest April 8, 2011.
    The remaining unvested shares granted in 2008 and the 2007 and
    2006 unvested shares contain a cliff vesting feature and vest
    either three or four years after the grant date for employees
    and three years for non-employee directors.

All unvested shares carry dividend and voting rights, and the
    sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) using
    the modified prospective method, and thus did not restate any
    prior period amounts. Under this method, compensation cost in
    the twelve months ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
    includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all
    share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of
    December 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in
    accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 and (2) all share-based payments
    granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant
    date fair value estimated using the Binomial lattice
    option-pricing model. Weighted average option fair values and
    assumptions for the period specified are disclosed in the
    following table:

The assumptions are as follows:

•

The Company estimated volatility using its historical share
    price performance over the contractual term of the option.

•

The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life
    of the option. The expected life assumption for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is an output of the
    Binomial lattice option-pricing model, which incorporates
    vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of
    post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option
    to define expected employee behavior.

•

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
    yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within
    the contractual life of the option. For the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we present the range of
    risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the
    U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice
    option-pricing model.

•

The expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s
    current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected
    dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the
    option.

The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
    entire award. Additionally, the Company’s general policy is
    to issue new shares of common stock to satisfy stock option
    exercises or grants of unvested shares.

Retirement
    Benefits

The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 effective
    December 31, 2006, which amends certain requirements of
    SFAS Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Under
    SFAS No. 158, companies are required to report the
    plan’s funded status on their balance sheets. The
    difference between the plan’s funded status and its current
    balance sheet position is recognized, net of tax, as a component
    of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension
    plans and other postretirement plans for its employees. The
    Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined
    benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans. In
    2008, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of
    SFAS. No. 158. Those provisions require the measurement
    date of plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the
    sponsor’s year end. Using the alternative approach for
    those defined benefit plans where the measurement date was not
    consistent with our year end, we recorded a decrease to Retained
    Earnings of $0.5 million, or $0.4 million after taxes,
    and an increase in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
    of $0.1 million.

The discount rates for our plans are derived by matching the
    plan’s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the
    equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The
    discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same
    present value of cash flows.

In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the
    Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on
    plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset
    return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the
    plan’s target asset allocation and current market
    conditions.

Prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the average remaining service period of active participants.
    Gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit
    obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the
    average remaining service period of active participants. Costs
    of bargaining unit-sponsored multi-employer plans and defined
    contribution plans were $9.8 million, $9.4 million and
    $7.8 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

For measurement purposes, an 8% weighted average annual rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
    was assumed for 2008. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually
    each year to a rate of 5.50% for 2014, and remain at that level
    thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care
    plans. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates
    would increase the service and interest cost components of the
    net periodic benefit cost by $0.2 million and the health
    care component of the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation by $1.9 million. A 1% decrease in the assumed



IDEX

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and
    interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost by
    $0.1 million and the health care component of the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
    $1.6 million.

Plan
    Assets

The Company’s pension plan weighted average asset
    allocations at December 31, 2008 and 2007, by asset
    category, were as follows:

Investment
    Policies and Strategies

The investment objectives of the Company’s plan assets are
    to earn the highest possible rate of return consistent with the
    tolerance for risk as determined periodically by the Company in
    its role as a fiduciary. The general guidelines of asset
    allocation of fund assets are that “equities” will
    represent from 55% to 75% of the market value of total fund
    assets with a target of 66%, and “fixed income”
    obligations, including cash, will represent from 25% to 45% with
    a target of 34%. The term “equities” includes common
    stock, convertible bonds and convertible stock. The term
    “fixed income” includes preferred stock

and/or

contractual payments with a specific maturity date. The Company
    strives to maintain asset allocations within the designated
    ranges by conducting periodic reviews of fund allocations and
    plan liquidity needs, and rebalancing the portfolio accordingly.
    The total fund performance is monitored and results measured
    using a 3- to

5-year

moving average against long-term absolute and relative return
    objectives to meet actuarially determined forecasted benefit
    obligations. No restrictions are placed on the selection of
    individual investments by the qualified investment fund
    managers. The performance of the investment fund managers is
    reviewed on a regular basis, using appointed professional
    independent advisors. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    there were no shares of the Company’s stock held in plan
    assets.

Cash
    Flows

The Company expects to contribute approximately
    $11.7 million to its defined benefit plans,
    $9.9 million to its defined contribution plans and
    $1.3 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in
    2009.

Estimated
    Future Benefit Payments

The future estimated benefit payments for the next five years
    and the five years thereafter are as follows: 2009 —
    $7.2 million; 2010 — $7.7 million;
    2011 — $8.1 million; 2012 —
    $8.6 million; 2013-$8.8 million; 2014 to
    2018 — $50.9 million.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of IDEX Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based
    compensation as a result of adopting Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123(R),

Share Based
    Payment

. As discussed in Note 16, effective
    December 31, 2006, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits as a
    result of adopting FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2009,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of IDEX Corporation

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
    of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. As described in Management’s Report on Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its
    assessment the internal control over financial reporting at
    Richter Chemie-Technik GmbH, iPEK

Spezial-TV

GmbH, Integrated Environmental Group Ltd, and Semrock, Inc.
    which were acquired in October 2008 and Innovadyne Technologies,
    Inc. which was acquired in November 2008. This exclusion
    represented approximately 1.7 percent of total sales and
    1.2 percent of net income as well as 14.3 percent of
    net assets and 13.9 percent of total assets for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Accordingly, our audit did not
    include the internal control over financial reporting at Richter
    Chemie-Technik GmbH, iPEK

Spezial-TV

GmbH, Integrated Environmental Group Ltd, Semrock, Inc, and
    Innovadyne Technologies, Inc. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. A company’s internal control over financial
    reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
    reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
    transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
    (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
    recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.



In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of
    the Company and our report dated February 26, 2009
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
    and financial statement schedule.

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process
    designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board
    of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America, and includes
    those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
    necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of
    the Company are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of management and directors of the
    Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
    detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide
    absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
    because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence
    and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
    breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over
    financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or
    improper management override. Because of such limitations, there
    is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
    detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
    reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known
    features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is
    possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though
    not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the
    framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2008.

The Company completed the acquisitions of Richter, iPEK, IETG
    and Semrock in October 2008 and Innovadyne in November 2008. Due
    to the timing of the acquisitions, management has excluded these
    acquisitions from our evaluation of effectiveness of internal
    controls over financial reporting. This exclusion represented
    approximately 1.7 percent of total sales and
    1.2 percent of net income as well as 14.3 percent of
    net assets and 13.9 percent of total assets for the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been
    audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent
    registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
    which appears herein.

Item 9.

Changes
    in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and
    Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
    are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
    in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such
    information is accumulated and communicated to the
    Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b),

the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of the Company’s management,
    including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the
    Company’s Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
    the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
    this report. Based on the foregoing, the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

The information set forth under the captions “Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and
    “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting” on pages 66 — 69 of
    Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and
    Supplementary Data is incorporated herein by reference.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal controls
    over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent
    fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
    likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company implemented a new ERP system at one of our business
    units. The Company believes that effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained during and after this
    conversion.

Item 9B.

Other
    Information.

None.

PART III

Item 10.

Directors,
    Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.

Information under the headings “Election of Directors”
    and “Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
    Compliance,” and the information under the subheading
    “Information Regarding the Board of Directors and
    Committees,” in the Company’s 2009 Proxy Statement is
    incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding
    executive officers of the Company is located in Part I.
    Item 1. of this report under the caption “Executive
    Officers of the Registrant.”

The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
    applicable to the Company’s directors, officers (including
    the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
    financial & accounting officer) and employees. The
    Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, along with the Audit
    Committee Charter, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
    Charter, Compensation Committee Charter and Corporate Governance
    Guidelines are available on the Company’s website at

www.idexcorp.com

.

In the event that we amend or waive any of the provisions of the
    Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our principal
    executive officer or principal financial & accounting
    officer, we intend to disclose the same on the Company’s
    website.

(2)

All Deferred Compensation Units (DCUs) issued under the
    Directors Deferred Compensation Plan and Deferred Compensation
    Plan for Non-officer Presidents are to be issued under the
    Incentive Award Plan and any DCUs remaining in these plans were
    eliminated by Shareholder approval on April 8, 2008.
    DCU’s issued under the Deferred Compensation Plan for
    Officers continue to be issued under the Incentive Award Plan.

The number of DCUs is determined by dividing the amount deferred
    by the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock the day
    before the date of deferral. The DCUs are entitled to receive
    dividend equivalents which are reinvested in DCUs based on the
    same formula for investment of a participant’s deferral.
    Since Deferred Compensation is payable upon separation of
    service within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code
    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, no benefits are
    payable prior to the date that is six months after the date of
    separation of service, or the date of death of the employee, if
    earlier.

Item 13.

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
    Independence.

No certain relationships exist. Information under the heading
    “Information Regarding the Board of Directors and
