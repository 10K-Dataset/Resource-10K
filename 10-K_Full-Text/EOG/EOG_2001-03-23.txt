					PART I

ITEM 1.  Business

General

      EOG  Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized  in  1985
("EOG"),  together  with  its subsidiaries,  explores  for,  develops,
produces  and  markets natural gas and crude oil  primarily  in  major
producing  basins  in  the United States, as well  as  in  Canada  and
Trinidad and, to a lesser extent, selected other international  areas.
EOG's   principal   producing  areas  are  further   described   under
"Exploration  and  Production" below.  At  December  31,  2000,  EOG's
estimated  net  proved natural gas reserves were 3,381  billion  cubic
feet  ("Bcf")  and  estimated net proved  crude  oil,  condensate  and
natural  gas  liquids reserves were 73 million barrels ("MMBbl")  (see
"Supplemental  Information to Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  on
page 43 of EOG's 2000 Annual Report to Shareholders ("Annual Report to
Shareholders")). At such date, approximately 56% of EOG's reserves (on
a  natural gas equivalent basis) was located in the United States, 15%
in  Canada and 29% in Trinidad. As of December 31, 2000, EOG  employed
approximately 850 persons, including foreign national employees.

      EOG's  business strategy is to maximize the rate  of  return  on
investment of capital by controlling all operating and capital  costs.
This  strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow  and
earnings  from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis.  EOG
focuses  its  drilling activity toward natural gas  deliverability  in
addition  to  natural gas reserve replacement and to a  lesser  extent
crude  oil exploitation. EOG focuses on the cost-effective utilization
of  advances  in technology associated with the gathering,  processing
and  interpretation  of  three-dimensional  seismic  data,  developing
reservoir simulation models and drilling operations through the use of
new  and/or improved drill bits, mud motors, mud additives,  formation
logging  techniques and reservoir fracturing methods.  These  advanced
technologies  are used, as appropriate, throughout EOG to  reduce  the
risks  associated with all aspects of oil and gas reserve exploration,
exploitation  and  development.   EOG  implements  its   strategy   by
emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to
find  and develop low cost reserves.  EOG also makes selected tactical
acquisitions  that result in additional economies  of  scale  or  land
positions  with  significant  additional  prospects.   Achieving   and
maintaining  the  lowest  possible operating cost  structure  that  is
consistent  with prudent and safe operations are also important  goals
in the implementation of EOG's strategy.

     With respect to information on EOG's working interest in wells or
acreage,  "net"  oil  and  gas  wells or  acreage  are  determined  by
multiplying  "gross"  oil and gas wells or acreage  by  EOG's  working
interest  in  the  wells  or acreage.  Unless otherwise  defined,  all
references to wells are gross.


Business Segments

      EOG's  operations are all natural gas and crude oil  exploration
and production related.


Exploration and Production

  North America Operations

      EOG's North American operations are organized into eight largely
autonomous business units or divisions, each focusing on one  or  more
basins,   utilizing  personnel  who  have  developed  experience   and
expertise  unique  to  the geology of the region,  thereby  leveraging
EOG's  knowledge and cost structure into enhanced returns on  invested
capital.

     At December 31, 2000, 85% of EOG's proved United States reserves
(on a natural gas equivalent basis) was natural gas and 15% was crude
oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. A substantial portion of
EOG's United States natural gas reserves is in long-lived fields with
well-established production histories. EOG believes that opportunities
exist to increase production in many of these fields through continued
infill and other development drilling. The following is a summary of
significant developments during 2000 and certain drilling plans for
2001 for EOG's North American operating divisions.

      Midland,  Texas  Division. The division's  operations  primarily
focus on the Southeastern New Mexico area, Val Verde Basin and Midland
Basin  of  West  Texas.  During 2000, the Midland  Division  increased
average  daily  production 31% from 111 million cubic feet  equivalent
("MMcfe") per day in 1999 to 145 MMcfe per day in 2000.  The  division
drilled 67 gross wells in 2000.  In early 2000, the division completed
a  property  trade with Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company,  which
added  approximately  170,000  acres  in  the  Permian  Basin  to  the
division's net acreage. During 2000, three new exploration  trends  in
the Permian Basin were defined and over 200,000 acres of new leasehold
and seismic options were added in these areas.  Plans for 2001 include
drilling  over  90  wells  in  the Permian  Basin  and  acquiring  new
leasehold and new three-dimensional seismic in high potential trends.




      Denver,  Colorado Division. Key producing areas for  the  Denver
Division   are   the   Big  Piney  -  LaBarge   Platform;   Vernal   -
Chapita/Natural  Buttes;  California - North  Shafter;  and  Southwest
Wyoming  -  Cepo/Cedar Chest. Net production in the division  averaged
133   million  cubic  feet  ("MMcf")  per  day  of  natural  gas   and
5.7  thousand  barrels ("MBbl") per day of crude oil, condensate,  and
natural  gas  liquids  in  2000. At December  31,  2000,  natural  gas
deliverability net to EOG was approximately 140 MMcf per  day.  During
2000,  the division drilled twelve successful wells in North  Shafter.
For  2001,  the  division plans to drill more wells in  this  area  to
continue  to gather information and ultimately determine the size  and
potential of the oil field.  During 2000, the division also integrated
and  merged  520  square  miles  of  three-dimensional  seismic  data,
covering  the  LaBarge Platform in Big Piney, Wyoming to identify  and
develop  both  shallow and deep exploratory prospects.   The  division
plans to drill more than 200 wells during 2001.

      Oklahoma City/Mid-Continent Division.    The   Mid-Continent
division's  activities  are concentrated in  the  Oklahoma  and  Texas
panhandles  and  in  the deeper Anadarko Basin.  Production  from  the
division  is  primarily from the Morrow, Toronto,  and  Council  Grove
formations.     During  2000, the division  drilled  105  gross  wells
replacing reserves by over 150%. During 2000, net production  for  the
division  averaged approximately 70 MMcf per day of  natural  gas  and
0.7  MBbl per day of crude oil and condensate.  The division assembled
an  additional 400,000 acres in the panhandle areas during  2000,  and
plans  to drill over 150 wells during 2001. EOG anticipates an  active
Mid-Continent drilling program for several years.

      Tyler,  Texas  Division.  The Tyler Division  increased  average
daily  production by 35% from 110 MMcfe per day in 1999 to  149  MMcfe
per  day  in 2000.  Key areas of production for the division  are  the
Sabine  Uplift Region, Upper Texas Coast and Mississippi  Salt  Basin.
During 2000, the division assimilated and exploited properties in  the
Sabine  Uplift Region which were acquired through a December 31,  1999
property trade. Net production for the division averaged approximately
113  MMcf  per day of natural gas and 5.9 MBbl per day of  crude  oil,
condensate  and  natural  gas liquids in 2000.   Plans  are  to  drill
another  50  wells in the Sabine Uplift areas, 20 wells in  the  Upper
Texas  and  Louisiana Coastal areas, and 30 wells in  the  Mississippi
Salt Basin during 2001.  The division also plans to enter several  new
exploratory areas, including the Bossier play in Louisiana.

      Corpus  Christi, Texas Division.  The Corpus Christi  Division's
activities  are focused in the Lobo/Roleta, Frio and Wilcox  producing
horizons  in South Texas. The principal areas of activity are  in  the
Frio  trend in Matagorda County and the Lobo/Roleta trend which occurs
primarily  in  Webb and Zapata Counties. Early in 2000,  the  division
made a discovery of over 100 billion cubic feet equivalent ("Bcfe") in
the  Roleta trend.  Two to three rigs drilled in the Roleta throughout
the year, drilling 39 gross wells with a success rate of approximately
90%.   The division exceeded 100% reserve replacement while increasing
average  daily production 21% from 152 MMcfe per day in  1999  to  184
MMcfe per day in 2000.  The growth came from significant acreage  that
was  added in three trends: the Lobo and Wilcox in South Texas and the
Geopressured  Frio  along  the Texas Gulf  Coast.   During  2000,  the
division identified seven fields with upside potential: Zwebb  -  Webb
and  Zapata Counties; El Huerfano - Zapata County; Pok-A-Dot -  Zapata
County;  Tiffany  -  Webb County; Rosita - Duval County;  Bucks  Bayou
North - Matagorda County; and Bay City Area - Matagorda County.

      Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Division.  This newest EOG division was
added  in  late  2000  following the purchase of Somerset  Oil  &  Gas
Company,  Inc., a small independent oil and gas operator in Appalachia
with   assets   located  primarily  in  Western   Pennsylvania.    The
acquisition  added approximately 150 Bcf of reserves and 400  Devonian
drilling  locations to EOG's portfolio.  For 2001, the division  plans
to  assemble  a  substantial acreage position for  exploration  plays,
shoot  additional  two-dimensional seismic and  drill  at  least  four
exploratory wells.  In addition, the division will focus on completing
its   staffing   to  become  a  fully  operational  exploitation   and
exploration unit.

      Houston, Texas/Offshore Division. The Offshore Division  focuses
on the Gulf of Mexico Shelf in Texas and Louisiana. Two fields, Eugene
Island 135 and Matagorda Island 623, account for a significant portion
of  the  division's production.  During 2000, total  daily  production
averaged  91 MMcfe per day compared to 133 MMcfe per day in  1999  due
primarily  to approximately 28 MMcf per day of natural gas  production
that  was traded on December 31, 1999.  By year-end 2000, the division
had  replaced, through successful drilling, the reduction  in  volumes
related  to  the property trade. During 2000, the division drilled  or
participated in five wells that resulted in an increase in production,
including  one  exploratory discovery at Matagorda  Island  704  which
added 5 MMcf per day.

      Calgary, Canada Division. The Calgary Division is engaged in the
exploration  for  and  the development, production  and  marketing  of
natural  gas,  natural gas liquids and crude oil  in  Western  Canada,
principally  in the provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and  Manitoba.
The  division  conducts operations from offices in  Calgary,  Alberta.
During  2000, the division was again successful with its  strategy  of
drilling a large number of shallow gas wells in Western Canada, adding
both  production and reserves.  The division increased production from
134  MMcfe  per  day in 1999 to 146 MMcfe per day in 2000  and  set  a
division record by drilling 434 wells, most of which were shallow gas.
Key  producing  areas  were Sandhills, Blackfoot  and  Grande  Prairie
(Wapiti).   Also  in  2000,  the division acquired  a  small  Canadian
producer,  Q  Energy  Limited,  which  had  assets  adjacent  to   the
division's existing Sandhills operation.  For 2001, the division plans
to drill at least 375 shallow gas wells in the Sandhills and




Blackfoot areas  and carry out further seismic and aeromagnetic surveys
on  the Northwest Territories acreage where drilling is planned for
early 2002.

  Outside North America Operations

      EOG has producing operations offshore Trinidad and is evaluating
exploration,  exploitation and development opportunities  in  selected
other international areas.

      Trinidad.   In  November 1992, EOG was  awarded  a  95%  working
interest concession in the South East Coast Consortium ("SECC")  Block
offshore  Trinidad, encompassing three undeveloped  fields  previously
held by three government-owned energy companies. The Kiskadee and Ibis
fields have since been developed, and the Oilbird field is anticipated
to  be  developed  within  the next several  years.  Existing  surplus
processing and transportation capacity at the Pelican field facilities
owned  and  operated by Trinidad and Tobago government-owned companies
is  being used to process and transport the production. Natural gas is
being  sold  into the local market under a take-or-pay agreement  with
the  National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2000,  deliveries
net  to EOG averaged 125 MMcf per day of natural gas and 2.6 MBbl  per
day of crude oil and condensate.

      In  1996,  EOG  signed a production sharing  contract  with  the
Government  of Trinidad and Tobago for the Modified U(a)  Block  where
EOG  holds a 100% working interest. The contract committed EOG to  the
acquisition  of  three-dimensional seismic data and  the  drilling  of
three  wells.  The first well, Osprey, was drilled  in  1998  and  was
successful, encountering over 400 feet of net pay. This is the largest
exploration discovery in EOG's history. During the fourth  quarter  of
1999, EOG drilled an unsuccessful exploration well, the Motmot, and in
the  first  quarter  of 2000, the Tanager well was  determined  to  be
unsuccessful.  These wells fulfilled the drilling obligations  on  the
block.  In 2000, EOG drilled the successful appraisal development  OA2
well, which resulted in an increase of booked reserves by 71 Bcfe to a
field total of 746 Bcfe.  At December 31, 2000, EOG held approximately
71,000 net undeveloped acres in Trinidad.

     In January 2000, EOG signed a 15-year natural gas supply contract
for  approximately 60 MMcf per day with the National  Gas  Company  of
Trinidad  and Tobago. This natural gas will supply a 1,850 metric  ton
per day anhydrous ammonia plant that is to be constructed by Caribbean
Nitrogen Company Limited, a Trinidadian company in which EOG has a 16%
interest.

      Other  International.  EOG continues to evaluate other  selected
conventional  natural  gas and crude oil opportunities  outside  North
America  primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries
where  indigenous  natural  gas  and  crude  oil  reserves  have  been
identified.


Marketing

    Wellhead  Marketing.   EOG's North America  wellhead  natural  gas
production  is  currently  being sold on the  spot  market  and  under
long-term natural gas contracts at market responsive prices.  In  many
instances,  the  long-term  contract prices  closely  approximate  the
prices  received  for  natural gas being  sold  on  the  spot  market.
Wellhead natural gas volumes from Trinidad are sold at prices that are
based on a fixed price schedule with annual escalations. Prior to  the
Share  Exchange (as described in "Relationship Between EOG  and  Enron
Corp." on page 7) and under terms of the production sharing contracts,
natural  gas volumes in India were sold to a nominee of the Government
of  India  at  a  price linked to a basket of world  market  fuel  oil
quotations with floor and ceiling limits.

    Substantially  all of EOG's wellhead crude oil and  condensate  is
sold under various terms and arrangements at market responsive prices.

    Other Marketing.  EOG Resources Marketing, Inc. ("EOGM"), a wholly
owned  subsidiary of EOG, is a marketing company engaging  in  various
marketing  activities. Both EOG and EOGM contract  to  provide,  under
short and long-term agreements, natural gas to various purchasers  and
then  aggregate  the necessary supplies for the sales  with  purchases
from   various  sources  including  third-party  producers,  marketing
companies, pipelines or from EOG's own production and arrange for  any
necessary transportation to the points of delivery. In addition,  EOGM
has  purchased and constructed several small gas gathering systems  in
order  to  facilitate its entry into the gas gathering business  on  a
limited  basis.  Both EOG and EOGM utilize other short  and  long-term
hedging and trading mechanisms including sales and purchases utilizing
NYMEX-related commodity market transactions from time to  time.  These
marketing activities have provided an effective balance in managing  a
portion  of  EOG's exposure to commodity price risks for both  natural
gas and crude oil and condensate wellhead prices. (See "Other Matters-
Risk Management").




Wellhead Volumes and Prices, and Lease and Well Expenses

      The  following  table  sets forth certain information  regarding
EOG's  wellhead  volumes of and average prices  for  natural  gas  per
thousand cubic feet ("Mcf"), crude oil and condensate, and natural gas
liquids  per  barrel ("Bbl"), and average lease and well expenses  per
thousand  cubic  feet equivalent ("Mcfe"-natural gas  equivalents  are
determined  using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of natural gas to  1.0  Bbl  of
crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids) delivered during each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. As a result  of
the  consensus of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-10,  "Accounting
for  Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs," EOG reclassified all prior
periods  to reflect certain transportation expenses incurred as  lease
and  well  expenses, instead of deductions from revenues as previously
reported.





Competition

        EOG   actively   competes   for   reserve   acquisitions   and
exploration/exploitation leases, licenses and concessions,  frequently
against  companies  with  substantially  larger  financial  and  other
resources. To the extent EOG's exploration budget is lower  than  that
of certain of its competitors, EOG may be disadvantaged in effectively
competing  for  certain  reserves, leases, licenses  and  concessions.
Competitive  factors  include price, contract terms,  and  quality  of
service,   including  pipeline  connection  times   and   distribution
efficiencies. In addition, EOG faces competition from other  producers
and  suppliers,  including competition from other  world  wide  energy
supplies, such as natural gas from Canada.

Regulation

     United States Regulation of Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production.
Natural gas and crude oil production operations are subject to various
types  of  regulation, including regulation in the  United  States  by
state and federal agencies.

      United States legislation affecting the oil and gas industry  is
under  constant  review  for  amendment or expansion.  Also,  numerous
departments  and agencies, both federal and state, are  authorized  by
statute  to  issue and have issued rules and regulations which,  among
other things, require permits for the drilling of wells, regulate  the
spacing  of  wells,  prevent  the waste  of  natural  gas  and  liquid
hydrocarbon  resources through proration and restrictions on  flaring,
require  drilling bonds and regulate environmental and safety matters.
The  regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its  cost
of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability.

      A  substantial portion of EOG's oil and gas leases  in  the  Big
Piney  area and in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as some in other areas,
are  granted by the federal government and administered by the  Bureau
of  Land  Management  (the "BLM") and the Minerals Management  Service
(the  "MMS"), both federal agencies. Operations conducted  by  EOG  on
federal  oil  and gas leases must comply with numerous  statutory  and
regulatory  restrictions  concerning  the  above  and  other  matters.
Certain  operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate  permits
issued by the BLM and the MMS.

       BLM  and  MMS  leases  contain  relatively  standardized  terms
requiring  compliance with detailed regulations and, in  the  case  of
offshore leases, orders pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf  Lands
Act (which are subject to change by the MMS). Such offshore operations
are  subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including  the  need
for  prior  MMS approval for exploration, development, and  production
plans,   stringent   engineering   and   construction   specifications
applicable  to offshore production facilities, regulations restricting
the  flaring  or venting of production, and regulations governing  the
plugging  and  abandonment of offshore wells and the  removal  of  all
production  facilities.  Under  certain  circumstances,  the  MMS  may
require  operations on federal leases to be suspended  or  terminated.
Any  such  suspension  or  termination could  adversely  affect  EOG's
interests.

      The  MMS  amended the regulations governing the  calculation  of
royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases,
effective  June  1,  2000.   The  new  rules  modified  the  valuation
procedures  for  both  arm's-length  and  non-arm's-length  crude  oil
transactions  to decrease reliance on oil posted prices and  assign  a
value  to  crude oil that, in the opinion of MMS, better reflects  its
market  value.   Two industry trade associations have sought  judicial
review of the new rules in federal district court.  EOG cannot predict
what  effect the outcome of the litigation will be or what effect,  if
any, it will have on EOG's operations.

      In  March 2000, a federal district court vacated MMS regulations
which  sought  to  clarify  the types of  costs  that  are  deductible
transportation costs for purposes of royalty valuation  of  production
sold  off the lease.  In particular, MMS disallowed deduction of costs
associated  with marketer fees, cash out and other pipeline  imbalance
penalties, or long-term storage fees.  The United States has  appealed
the district court ruling.  EOG cannot predict what the outcome of the
appeal  will  be  or  what  effect, if any,  it  will  have  on  EOG's
operations.

     Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids by EOG are
made at unregulated market prices.

      The  transportation  and  sale for  resale  of  natural  gas  in
interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas  Act  of
1938  (the "NGA") and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the "NGPA").
These  statutes  are  administered by the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission  (the "FERC"). Effective January 1, 1993, the  Natural  Gas
Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for  all
"first  sales" of natural gas, which includes all sales by EOG of  its
own  production. All other sales of natural gas by EOG, such as  those
of  natural  gas  purchased from third parties, remain  jurisdictional
sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the NGA, which  has
flexible  terms  and conditions. Consequently, all of EOG's  sales  of
natural  gas  currently  may  be made at  market  prices,  subject  to
applicable  contract provisions. EOG's jurisdictional sales,  however,
are  subject  to the future possibility of greater federal  oversight,
including  the  possibility the FERC might prospectively  impose  more
restrictive conditions on such sales.


      Since  1985,  the FERC has endeavored to enhance competition  in
natural  gas  markets  by  making  natural  gas  transportation   more
accessible  to  natural  gas  buyers  and  sellers  on  an  open   and
nondiscriminatory basis. These efforts culminated in Order No. 636 and
various   rehearing  orders  ("Order  No.  636"),  which   mandate   a
fundamental restructuring of interstate natural gas pipeline sales and
transportation  services,  including the  "unbundling"  by  interstate
natural gas pipelines of the sales, transportation, storage, and other
components  of  their service, and to separately state the  rates  for
each unbundled service. Order No. 636 does not directly regulate EOG's
activities,  but  has an indirect effect because of its  broad  scope.
Order  No.  636  has ended interstate pipelines' traditional  role  as
wholesalers of natural gas, and substantially increased competition in
natural  gas markets. In spite of this uncertainty, Order No. 636  may
enhance  EOG's  ability  to  market  and  transport  its  natural  gas
production,  although  it  may also subject EOG  to  more  restrictive
pipeline  imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation  of
such tolerances.

      EOG  owns, directly or indirectly, certain natural gas pipelines
that  it  believes  meet the traditional tests the FERC  has  used  to
establish  a  pipeline's  status as a gatherer  not  subject  to  FERC
jurisdiction  under the NGA. State regulation of gathering  facilities
generally  includes  various  safety,  environmental,  and   in   some
circumstances,  nondiscriminatory  take  requirements,  but  does  not
generally  entail rate regulation. Natural gas gathering  may  receive
greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels as  a
result of pipeline restructuring under Order No. 636. For example, the
Texas  Railroad  Commission has approved changes  to  its  regulations
governing   transportation  and  gathering   services   performed   by
intrastate pipelines and gatherers, which prohibit such entities  from
unduly  discriminating in favor of their affiliates.  EOG's  gathering
operations could be adversely affected should they be subject  in  the
future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates  and
services.

      EOG's  natural gas gathering operations also may  be  or  become
subject  to safety and operational regulations relating to the design,
installation,  testing,  construction,  operation,  replacement,   and
management  of facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining
to  these  matters are considered or adopted from time  to  time.  EOG
cannot predict what effect, if any, such legislation might have on its
operations,  but  the industry could be required to  incur  additional
capital   expenditures  and  increased  costs  depending   on   future
legislative and regulatory changes.

      The  FERC  recently  began a broad review of its  transportation
regulations,  including  how they operate in  conjunction  with  state
proposals for retail gas marketing restructuring, whether to eliminate
cost-of-service  rates  for  short-term  transportation,  whether   to
allocate all short-term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions,
and  whether changes to its long-term transportation policies may also
be appropriate to alleviate a market bias toward short-term contracts.
This  review  culminated  in part with the FERC's  issuance  of  Order
No. 637 on February 9, 2000.

     Order No. 637 revises the FERC's current regulatory framework for
purposes  of  improving  the efficiency of the  market  and  providing
captive  pipeline customers with the opportunity to reduce their  cost
of  holding  long-term pipeline capacity while continuing  to  protect
against  the  exercise  of market power. Order No.  637  revises  FERC
pricing  policy  by  waiving price ceilings  for  short-term  released
capacity  for a two year period and permitting pipelines to  file  for
peak/off-peak and term differentiated rate structures. Order  No.  637
does  not, however, require the allocation of all short-term  capacity
on  the  basis  of competitive auctions--as had been proposed  by  the
FERC.  Order  No.  637  adopts  changes  in  regulations  relating  to
scheduling procedures, capacity segmentation and pipeline penalties to
improve  the competitiveness and efficiency of the interstate pipeline
grid.  It  also narrows pipeline customers' right of first refusal  to
remove  economic  biases in the current rule, while  still  protecting
captive  customers'  ability  to resubscribe  to  long-term  capacity.
Finally, it improves the FERC's reporting requirements to provide more
transparent  pricing information and permit more effective  monitoring
of  the  market.  Appeals of Order No. 637 are pending  court  review.
EOG  cannot  predict what the outcome of that review will be  or  what
effect it will have on EOG's operations.

      While  Order No. 637, and any subsequent FERC action will affect
EOG  only indirectly, the Order and related inquiries are intended  to
further  enhance competition in natural gas markets, while maintaining
adequate consumer protections.

      EOG  cannot  predict the effect that any of  the  aforementioned
orders or the challenges to such orders will ultimately have on  EOG's
operations. Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the
natural gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the
FERC  and  the  courts. EOG cannot predict when or  whether  any  such
proposals or proceedings may become effective. It should also be noted
that  the  natural  gas industry historically has  been  very  heavily
regulated;  therefore, there is no assurance that the  less  regulated
approach   currently   being  pursued  by  the  FERC   will   continue
indefinitely.

      Environmental Regulation.  Various federal, state and local laws
and   regulations  covering  the  discharge  of  materials  into   the
environment,   or  otherwise  relating  to  the  protection   of   the
environment,  affect EOG's operations and costs as a result  of  their
effect  on  natural  gas  and crude oil exploration,  development  and
production  operations  and could cause EOG to  incur  remediation  or
other  corrective  action  costs  in  connection  with  a  release  of
regulated  substances, including crude oil, into the  environment.  In
addition,  EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from  third
parties  whose actions with respect to the management and disposal  or
release  of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control.
Under  environmental laws and regulations, EOG could  be  required  to
remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners  or
operators.





Compliance with such laws and regulations increases  EOG's
overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on
EOG's  operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based
on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near
future  to  expend amounts that are material in relation to its  total
exploration  and  development expenditure program in order  to  comply
with  each environmental law and regulation, but inasmuch as such laws
and  regulations are frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict  the
ultimate cost of compliance.

      Canadian  Regulation.   In  Canada, the  petroleum  industry  is
subject  to  extensive controls and operates under various  provincial
and   federal  legislation  and  regulations  governing  land  tenure,
royalties,    taxes,   production   rates,   operational    standards,
environmental  protection,  health  and  safety,  exports  and   other
matters.  EOG operates within this regulatory framework and  continues
to  monitor  and  evaluate the impact of the  regulatory  regime  when
determining  parameters  for engaging in oil and  gas  activities  and
investments  in  Canada. The price of natural gas  and  crude  oil  in
Canada has been deregulated and is determined by market conditions and
negotiations  between  buyers and sellers in a North  American  market
place.  The North American Free Trade Agreement supports the  on-going
cross-border commercial transactions of the natural gas and crude  oil
business.

      Various  matters relating to the transportation  and  export  of
natural  gas  continue  to  be  subject to  regulation  by  provincial
agencies  and  federally, by the National Energy Board;  however,  the
North  American  Free  Trade Agreement may have reduced  the  risk  of
altering  existing  cross-border commercial transactions  through  the
assurance  of  fair  implementation  of  regulatory  changes,  minimal
disruption   of  contractual  arrangements  and  the  prohibition   of
discriminatory order restrictions and export taxes.

      Canadian governmental regulations may have a material effect  on
the  economic  parameters for engaging in oil and  gas  activities  in
Canada  and  may  have  a  material  effect  on  the  advisability  of
investments  in  Canadian  oil  and gas drilling  activities.  EOG  is
monitoring political, regulatory and economic developments in Canada.

     Other International Regulation.  EOG's exploration and production
operations  outside  North America are subject  to  various  types  of
regulations imposed by the respective governments of the countries  in
which  EOG's operations are conducted, and may affect EOG's operations
and  costs within that country. EOG currently has operations  offshore
Trinidad.

Relationship Between EOG and Enron Corp.

     On August 16, 1999, EOG and Enron Corp. closed the Share Exchange
Agreement  in  which EOG acquired 62,270,000 shares  of  EOG's  common
stock  out  of  82,270,000 shares then owned by Enron  Corp.,  and  in
return  Enron Corp. received all of the stock of EOGI-India,  Inc.,  a
subsidiary of EOG ("Share Exchange"). EOGI-India, Inc. owned,  through
subsidiaries, all of EOG's assets and operations in India  and  China,
and  had  received  from  EOG an indirect $600  million  cash  capital
contribution,  plus  certain intercompany receivables,  prior  to  the
Share  Exchange.  EOG recognized a $575 million tax-free gain  on  the
Share Exchange based on the fair value of the shares received, net  of
transaction  fees  of  $14  million.  On  the  closing  of  the  Share
Exchange, all of Enron Corp.'s officers and directors then serving  as
Company directors resigned from EOG's board.  Following the closing of
the Share Exchange, Enron Corp. sold 8,500,000 shares of Company stock
pursuant to a public offering in which EOG also sold 27,000,000 shares
of  its  common stock. Subsequent to the closing of the Share Exchange
and  the  common stock offering, Enron Corp. sold securities that  are
mandatorily  exchangeable at maturity into a minimum of 9,746,250  EOG
shares  and  a maximum of 11,500,000 EOG shares, the latter  being  an
amount  equal  to all of Enron Corp.'s remaining shares  in  EOG.  The
maturity date for these securities is July 31, 2002.

      EOG  and  Enron  Corp.  have in the past entered  into  material
transactions  and agreements incident to their respective  businesses.
Such  transactions and agreements have related to, among other things,
the  purchase  and  sale  of natural gas and crude  oil,  hedging  and
trading  activities  and the provision of certain corporate  services.
Many  of these agreements are still in place, and EOG and Enron  Corp.
may  enter  into similar types of transactions and agreements  in  the
future.  EOG  intends  that the terms of any future  transactions  and
agreements with Enron Corp. will be at least as favorable  to  EOG  as
could be obtained from other third parties.

Other Matters

      Energy Prices.  Since EOG is primarily a natural gas company, it
is  more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices  than
in  the  prices  for  crude oil, condensate or  natural  gas  liquids.
Average North America wellhead natural gas prices have fluctuated,  at
times   rather  dramatically,  during  the  last  three  years.  These
fluctuations  resulted  in  a 15% decrease  in  the  average  wellhead
natural gas price for North America received by EOG from 1997 to 1998,
an increase of 11% from 1998 to 1999, and an increase of 80% from 1999
to 2000. Wellhead natural gas volumes from Trinidad are sold at prices
that are based on a fixed schedule with annual escalations. Due to the
many  uncertainties  associated with the world political  environment,
the  availabilities  of  other  world wide  energy  supplies  and  the
relative  competitive relationships of the various energy  sources  in
the  view of the consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes  may
occur in natural gas prices in the future.


      Substantially all of EOG's wellhead crude oil and condensate  is
sold under various terms and arrangements at market responsive prices.
Crude  oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated during the  last
three  years. Due to the many uncertainties associated with the  world
political  environment, the availabilities of other world wide  energy
supplies  and  the relative competitive relationships of  the  various
energy  sources in the view of the consumers, EOG is unable to predict
what  changes  may  occur in crude oil and condensate  prices  in  the
future.

     Risk Management.  EOG engages in price risk management activities
from time to time primarily for non-trading and to a lesser extent for
trading  purposes. Derivative financial instruments  (primarily  price
swaps  and costless collars) are utilized for non-trading purposes  to
hedge  the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude  oil
market prices on net income and cash flow.

     At December 31, 2000, EOG had outstanding swap contracts covering
notional  volumes  of approximately 0.7 million barrels  ("MMBbl")  of
crude oil and condensate for 2001.  EOG elected not to designate these
crude  oil swap contracts as a hedge of its 2001 crude oil production,
and accordingly, is accounting for these swap contracts under mark-to-
market accounting.  At December 31, 2000, the fair value of these swap
contracts was $0.4 million.

     In February 2001, EOG entered into price swap agreements covering
notional  volumes  of 0.6 MMBbl of oil for the period  March  2001  to
December  2001  at  an average price of $28.09 per  Bbl  and  notional
volumes  of 100,000 million British thermal units of natural  gas  per
day (MMBtu/d) for the months of April and May 2001 at an average price
of  $5.16 per MMBtu.  EOG will account for these swap contracts  under
mark-to-market accounting.

     In  February  2001, a Canadian subsidiary of EOG  priced  certain
natural  gas physical agreements for approximately 47,000 MMBtu/d  for
the  months of April and May 2001 at an average NYMEX price of US$5.16
per MMBtu less applicable basis (location) adjustments.

     At December 31, 2000, based on EOG's tax position and the portion
of  EOG's  anticipated natural gas volumes for 2001 for  which  prices
have  not, in effect, been hedged using NYMEX-related commodity market
transactions   and   long-term  marketing   contracts,   EOG's   price
sensitivity  for each $.10 per Mcf change in average wellhead  natural
gas  prices is $19 million (or $0.16 per share) for net income and $19
million  for  current operating cash flow.  EOG  is  not  impacted  as
significantly  by  changing crude oil prices  for  those  volumes  not
otherwise  hedged.  EOG's price sensitivity for each $1.00 per  barrel
change  in  average wellhead crude oil prices is $6 million (or  $0.05
per  share)  for net income and $6 million for current operating  cash
flow.

    Tight Gas Sand Tax Credits(Section 29) and Severance Tax Exemption.
United States federal tax law provides a tax  credit  for production of
certain  fuels produced from  nonconventional  sources (including
natural gas produced from tight formations), subject  to  a number of
limitations.  Fuels qualifying  for  the  credit  must  be produced
from  a well drilled or a facility placed in  service  after
November  5, 1990 and before January 1, 1993, and must be sold before
January 1, 2003.

      The  credit, which is currently approximately $.52  per  million
British thermal units of natural gas, is computed by reference to  the
price  of  crude  oil, and is phased out as the  price  of  crude  oil
exceeds  $23.50 in 1980 dollars (adjusted for inflation) with complete
phaseout  if  such  price  exceeds $29.50 in 1980  dollars  (similarly
adjusted). Under this formula, the commencement of phaseout  would  be
triggered  if the average price for crude oil rose above approximately
$47  per barrel in current dollars. Significant benefits from the  tax
credit have accrued and continue to accrue to EOG since a portion (and
in  some  cases a substantial portion) of EOG's natural gas production
from  new wells drilled after November 5, 1990, and before January  1,
1993,  on EOG's leases in several of EOG's significant producing areas
qualify  for  this  tax  credit. In 1999 and 2000,  EOG  entered  into
arrangements  with  a third party whereby certain Section  29  credits
were  sold  by  EOG to the third party, and payments for such  credits
will be received on an as-generated basis.

      Natural gas production from wells spudded or completed after May
24,  1989  and before September 1, 1996 in tight formations  in  Texas
qualifies  for a ten-year exemption from severance taxes,  subject  to
certain limitations, during the period beginning September 1, 1991 and
ending  August  31,  2001.  In addition, natural gas  production  from
qualifying wells spudded or completed after August 31, 1996 and before
September 1, 2010 is entitled to use of a reduced severance tax  rate.
However,  the cumulative value of the tax reduction cannot  exceed  50
percent  of the drilling and completion costs incurred on  a  well  by
well basis.

      Other.   All  of EOG's natural gas and crude oil activities  are
subject  to  the  risks normally incident to the exploration  for  and
development  and  production of natural gas and crude  oil,  including
blowouts, cratering and fires, each of which could result in damage to
life  and  property. Offshore operations are subject to  usual  marine
perils,  including  hurricanes and other adverse  weather  conditions.
EOG's activities are also subject to governmental regulations as  well
as  interruption or termination by governmental authorities  based  on
environmental  and other considerations. In accordance with  customary
industry  practices,




insurance is maintained by EOG against some,  but not all, of the risks.
Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues
and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance.

      EOG's operations outside of North America are subject to certain
risks, including expropriation of assets, risks of increases in  taxes
and  government  royalties, renegotiation of  contracts  with  foreign
governments,   political  instability,  payment  delays,   limits   on
allowable  levels of production and currency exchange and repatriation
losses, as well as changes in laws, regulations and policies governing
operations of foreign companies generally.

      There are no family relationships among the officers listed, and
there  are no arrangements or understandings pursuant to which any  of
them  were  elected  as officers.  Officers are appointed  or  elected
annually by the Board of Directors at its first meeting following  the
Annual  Meeting  of  Shareholders,  each  to  hold  office  until  the
corresponding  meeting  of  the Board in the  next  year  or  until  a
successor shall have been elected, appointed or shall have qualified.


ITEM 2.  Properties

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Properties and Reserves

      Reserve  Information.  For estimates of  EOG's  net  proved  and
proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids, including  crude
oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, see "Supplemental Information
to   Consolidated  Financial  Statements"  in  the  Annual  Report  to
Shareholders.

       There   are   numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating
quantities  of  proved  reserves and in  projecting  future  rates  of
production  and  timing  of development expenditures,  including  many
factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set forth
in  Supplemental  Information  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements
represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective  process
of  estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  and  liquids,
including  crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, that  cannot
be  measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve  estimate
is  a  function  of the amount and quality of available  data  and  of
engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As  a  result,
estimates  of different engineers normally vary. In addition,  results
of  drilling,  testing and production subsequent to  the  date  of  an
estimate  may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly,  reserve
estimates   are   often  different  from  the  quantities   ultimately
recovered.  The  meaningfulness of such estimates is highly  dependent
upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based.

      In general, the volume of production from oil and gas properties
owned  by EOG declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the  extent
EOG  acquires  additional  properties containing  proved  reserves  or
conducts   successful   exploration,  exploitation   and   development
activities,  the proved reserves of EOG will decline as  reserves  are
produced.  Volumes  generated  from  future  activities  of  EOG   are
therefore  highly dependent upon the level of success  in  finding  or
acquiring  additional  reserves and the costs incurred  in  so  doing.
EOG's  estimates of reserves filed with other federal  agencies  agree
with  the  information  set  forth  in  Supplemental  Information   to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


      Acreage.   The  following table summarizes EOG's  developed  and
undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2000. Excluded is acreage in which
EOG's  interest  is limited to owned royalty, overriding  royalty  and
other similar interests.


      Producing  Well  Summary.  The following  table  reflects  EOG's
ownership  in gas and oil wells located in Texas, the Gulf of  Mexico,
Oklahoma,  New Mexico, Utah, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and various  other
states,  Canada and Trinidad at December 31, 2000. Gross gas  and  oil
wells include 233 with multiple completions.

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

       This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  includes  forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act  of
1933  and  Section  21E of the Securities Exchange Act  of  1934.  All
statements other than statements of historical facts, including, among
others, statements regarding EOG's future financial position, business
strategy,   budgets,   reserve  information,   projected   levels   of
production, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for
future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically  uses
words   such   as  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "estimate,"   "strategy,"
"intend,"  "plan,"  "target" and "believe" or the  negative  of  those
terms  or  other  variations of them or by comparable  terminology  to
identify  its  forward-looking statements. In particular,  statements,
express  or  implied,  concerning  future  operating  results  or  the
ability  to increase reserves or to generate income or cash flows  are
forward-looking   statements.  Forward-looking  statements   are   not
guarantees  of  performance. Although EOG  believes  its  expectations
reflected  in  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  reasonable
assumptions, no assurance can be given that these expectations will be
achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to  differ
materially  from  the  expectations reflected in  the  forward-looking
statements  include,  among others: timing and extent  of  changes  in
commodity  prices for crude oil, natural gas and related products  and
interest  rates;  extent of EOG's success in discovering,  developing,
marketing  and  producing  reserves  and  in  acquiring  oil  and  gas
properties;  political developments around the  world;  and  financial
market conditions.

      In  light  of  these risks, uncertainties and  assumptions,  the
events  anticipated  by  EOG's forward-looking  statements  might  not
occur.  EOG  undertakes  no  obligations  to  update  or  revise   its
forward-looking  statements, whether as a result of  new  information,
future events or otherwise.


ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

      EOG's exposure to interest rate risk and commodity price risk is
discussed  respectively in the Financing and Outlook sections  of  the
"Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and
Results  of Operations -- Capital Resources and Liquidity,"  which  is
incorporated by reference from pages page 22 of the Annual  Report  to
Shareholders. EOG's exposure to foreign currency exchange  rate  risks
and other market risks is insignificant.
