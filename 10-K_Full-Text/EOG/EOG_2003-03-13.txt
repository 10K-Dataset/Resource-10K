                             PART I

ITEM 1.  Business

General

     EOG Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in
1985 ("EOG"), together with its subsidiaries, explores for,
develops, produces and markets natural gas and crude oil
primarily in major producing basins in the United States, as well
as in Canada and Trinidad and, to a lesser extent, selected other
international areas. EOG's principal producing areas are further
described under "Exploration and Production" below.  EOG's
website address is http://www.eogresources.com.  EOG's Annual
Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current
Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are made
available, free of charge, through its website as soon as
reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     At December 31, 2002, EOG's estimated net proved natural gas
reserves were 4,091 billion cubic feet ("Bcf") and estimated net
proved crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids reserves
were 85 million barrels ("MMBbl") (see "Supplemental Information
to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 37 of EOG's Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 20, 2003, which included financial
statements of EOG for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002
(the "Form 8-K filed on February 20, 2003")).  At such date,
approximately 49% of EOG's reserves (on a natural gas equivalent
basis) was located in the United States, 19% in Canada and 32%
in Trinidad.  As of December 31, 2002, EOG employed approximately
1,000 persons, including foreign national employees.

     EOG's business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on
investment of capital by controlling all operating and capital
costs.  This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of
cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-
effective basis.  EOG focuses its drilling activity toward
natural gas deliverability in addition to natural gas reserve
replacement and to a lesser extent crude oil exploitation and
exploration.  EOG focuses on the cost-effective utilization of
advances in technology associated with the gathering, processing
and interpretation of three-dimensional seismic data, the
development of reservoir simulation models, the use of new and/or
improved drill bits, mud motors and mud additives, and formation
logging techniques and reservoir fracturing methods. These
advanced technologies are used, as appropriate, throughout EOG to
reduce the risks associated with all aspects of oil and gas
reserve exploration, exploitation and development.  EOG
implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally
generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost
reserves.  EOG also makes selected tactical acquisitions that
result in additional economies of scale or land positions with
significant additional prospects.  Achieving and maintaining the
lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with
prudent and safe operations are also important goals in the
implementation of EOG's strategy.

     With respect to information on EOG's working interest in
wells or acreage, "net" oil and gas wells or acreage are
determined by multiplying "gross" oil and gas wells or acreage by
EOG's working interest in the wells or acreage.  Unless otherwise
defined, all references to wells are gross.

Business Segments

     EOG's operations are all natural gas and crude oil
exploration and production related.

Exploration and Production

  North American Operations

     EOG's North American operations are organized into eight
operating divisions, each focusing on several basins, utilizing
personnel who have developed experience and expertise unique to
the geology of the region, thereby leveraging EOG's knowledge and
cost structure into enhanced returns on invested capital.

     At December 31, 2002, 84% of EOG's proved United States
reserves (on a natural gas equivalent basis) was natural gas and
16% was crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.  A
substantial portion of EOG's United States natural gas reserves
are in long-lived fields with well-established production
histories. EOG believes that opportunities exist to increase
production in many of these fields through continued development
and application of new technology.  EOG will also continue an
active exploration program, designed to extend existing fields
and add new trends to our broad portfolio of North American
plays.  The following is a summary of significant developments
during 2002 and certain drilling plans for 2003 for EOG's North
American operating divisions.

     Midland, Texas Division.  The Division operations are
primarily focused in the Delaware, Val Verde and Midland Basin
areas of West Texas, and Southeast New Mexico.  During 2002, the
Division continued to focus on improving drilling and exploration
techniques in the Devonian Horizontal Trend with the successful
implementation of dual lateral completion technology, which has
lowered finding costs and improved rates of return for the play.
The Division also introduced water-fracturing technology to the
Devonian play with encouraging results.  During 2002, the
Division drilled 65 wells and net average daily production was 94
million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day of natural gas and 6.5
thousand barrels ("MBbl") per day of crude oil, condensate and
natural gas liquids. The Midland Division plans an aggressive
drilling program focused in the Devonian and Permo-Penn Carbonate
Trends of West Texas, the Atoka/Morrow Trends in Southeast New
Mexico, and in the Barnett Shale Trend of the Ft. Worth Basin.
The Division will also continue to develop secondary recovery
projects to increase production from existing fields.  EOG has
developed a wide range of new growth opportunities in the Permian
Basin to ensure continued growth.

     Denver, Colorado Division.  Key producing and exploration
areas continue to be in the traditional core areas of Big Piney -
LaBarge Platform; Vernal - Uintah Basin / Chapita / Natural
Buttes; and Southwest Wyoming - Washakie Basin.  During 2002, the
Division continued development of these core areas and further
expanded the 2001 Uintah Basin exploration successes, drilling
seven delineation wells.  The Division drilled or participated in
76 development wells and eight wildcats during 2002.  The
activity level of 2002 was moderated from 2001, primarily due to
fiscal restraint brought on by lower natural gas prices
throughout the Rockies.  Net production for the Division in 2002
averaged 121 MMcf per day of natural gas and 6.6 MBbl per day of
crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.  EOG expects that
drilling will increase in Big Piney, Wyoming and Vernal, Utah
during 2003.

     Oklahoma City/Mid-Continent Division. The Mid-Continent
Division had average net production during 2002 of approximately
71 MMcf per day of natural gas and 2.1 MBbl of crude oil and
condensate.  In the fourth quarter 2002, net average production
of natural gas increased 19% to 81 MMcf per day in 2002 from 68
MMcf per day in 2001, in addition to an increase of crude oil and
condensate production to 1.9 MBbl in the fourth quarter 2002
compared to 1.1 MBbl in the same period for 2001.  The Division's
production activities span 48 counties in four states with the
volume increase resulting largely from the continued success in
the Hugoton-Deep Trend drilling in Texas County, Oklahoma. The
2002 division drilling program included 128 wells in three states
which resulted in 189% reserve replacement.  Most notable for
2002, were seven wells drilled in the Hugoton-Deep, Marmaton play
that produced 3 billion cubic feet equivalent ("Bcfe") in the
last six months of 2002.  In addition, the Division's Texas
County War Party Waterflood produced 670 MBbl of crude oil from
the Cherokee formation and the project paid out in less than ten
months.  The Division had numerous stratigraphic discoveries in
other plays throughout the basin and expects to drill a slightly
expanded program in 2003.

    Tyler, Texas Division.  Key areas of production for the
Division are the Sabine Uplift Region, Upper Texas Coast and
Mississippi Salt Basin.  During 2002, the Division drilled or
participated in 55 wells.  Net production for the Division
averaged approximately 106 MMcf per day of natural gas and 3.9
MBbl per day of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids in
2002.   The Division had continued success in the Mississippi
Salt Basin, drilling for the shallow Eutaw and Selma Chalk and
the deep Hosston and Sligo Formations.  EOG expects drilling in
these areas to continue through 2003 and expects to have an
active program in the East Texas Sabine Uplift Region.

     Corpus Christi, Texas Division.  The Corpus Christi Division
had an active 2002, drilling 56 wells.  During 2002, net
production for the Division averaged 160 MMcf per day of natural
gas, an increase of approximately 7% over 2001.  The Division had
reserve replacement through drilling of 135% and for the fifth
year in a row the reserves per well drilled have increased. The
principal areas of activity are in the Frio Trend in Matagorda,
Nueces and San Patricio Counties, the Wilcox Trend in Duval
County, and the Lobo/Roleta Trend in Webb and Zapata Counties.
EOG expects that drilling will continue to be strong through 2003
in Nueces, San Patricio, Duval, Webb and Zapata Counties.

      Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania Division.  In 2002, the  Division
drilled 200 shallow wells.  Net average production increased from
13  MMcf  per day of natural gas in 2001 to 20 MMcf  per  day  of
natural  gas in 2002.  The Division expanded its acreage position
by  over  60,000  net  acres in key exploratory  and  development
plays, and plans to drill in excess of 200 wells in 2003.   While
most  of  the  division drilling will concentrate on  development
wells,  several  higher  impact  exploratory  and  unconventional
reservoir wells will be drilled in 2003.

     Houston, Texas/Offshore Division.  The Offshore Division
focuses on the Gulf of Mexico in Texas and Louisiana.  Two
fields, Eugene Island 135 and Matagorda Island 623, account for
over half of the Division's production.  During 2002, total net
production averaged approximately 63 MMcf per day of natural gas.
Throughout 2002, the Division drilled or participated in eight
wells, including a significant exploration discovery at South
Timbalier 156.  EOG operates and has a 50% working interest in
this estimated 50 Bcfe discovery which is expected to commence
sales in the third quarter of 2003.  Another discovery on High
Island 206 came on line in February 2003.  Two successful
development wells were drilled on the Matagorda Island 623 block.
Deep water activity included the assignment, with regulatory
permitting contingencies, of one half the working interest held
in the Tuscany prospect, acquired in the 2001 Eastern Gulf Lease
Sale, to an industry partner in consideration for their agreement
to bear 100% of EOG's cost for drilling the initial exploratory
well expected to be drilled in 2003.  EOG retains a 37.5% working
interest in the prospect.

     Calgary, Canada Division.  The Division conducts operations
through EOG's Canadian subsidiary, EOG Resources Canada Inc.,
from offices in Calgary, Alberta.  During 2002, the Division was
again successful with its strategy of drilling a large number of
shallow gas wells in Western Canada, which contributed to a
record 1,089 wells drilled in 2002, and increased its reserve
base and production potential.  Strategic property and small
corporate acquisitions were also utilized to expand the shallow
gas platform area in Southwest Saskatchewan and Southeast
Alberta.  Division net production during 2002 averaged
approximately 154 MMcf per day of natural gas, as compared to 126
MMcf per day of natural gas during 2001.  New wells coming on
stream late in the year increased December 2002 net average
deliverability to 185 MMcfe per day. Key producing areas in the
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin were Sandhills, Blackfoot, SE
Alberta Shallow and Grande Prairie - Wapiti.

  Outside North America Operations

     EOG has producing operations offshore Trinidad and is
evaluating exploration, exploitation and development
opportunities in selected other international areas.  The
Trinidad operations are conducted through its Trinidadian
subsidiary, EOG Resources Trinidad Limited ("EOGRT"), from
its Port of Spain, Trinidad, office.

     Trinidad.  In November 1992, EOG, through its
subsidiary, EOGRT, was awarded a 95% working interest
concession in the South East Coast Consortium ("SECC") Block
offshore Trinidad, encompassing three undeveloped fields -
the Kiskadee, Ibis and Oilbird fields, previously held by
three government-owned energy companies.  The Kiskadee and
Ibis fields have since been developed.  The Oilbird field
was successfully appraised by the drilling of two wells in
the fourth quarter of 2001 and will be developed over the
next few years.  The Oilbird 2 well encountered 380 feet of
net pay and the Oilbird 3 well encountered 290 feet of net
pay.  A discovery was made with the Parula #1 wildcat well
in 2002 which encountered 370 feet of net pay.  This field
is scheduled to be developed and brought on stream during
2004.  Existing surplus processing and transportation
capacity at the Pelican field facilities owned and operated
by Trinidad and Tobago government-owned companies is being
used to process and transport existing production.  Natural
gas is being sold into the local market under a take-or-pay
agreement with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and
Tobago.  In 2002, deliveries net to EOG averaged 135 MMcf
per day of natural gas and 2.4 MBbl per day of crude oil and
condensate.  In August 2002, EOG and its co-owners were
granted a 25-year extension of the SECC Block through
December 2029.

     In July 1996, EOG, through its subsidiary, EOG Resources
Trinidad-U(a) Block Ltd., signed a production sharing
contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for the
Modified U(a) Block where EOG holds a 100% working interest.
EOG drilled its first commitment well, OA-1, on this block
in 1998.  This well encountered over 500 feet of net pay. In
the first quarter of 2001, EOG drilled the OA-2 well which
encountered 305 feet of net pay and increased gross proved
reserves to a field total of 870 Bcfe.  In September 2001,
EOG set a platform and jacket and first production began in
the third quarter of 2002.  This field supplies
approximately 50 MMcf per day, net to EOG, under a 15-year
natural gas supply contract to a 1,850 metric ton per day
anhydrous ammonia plant which is owned by Caribbean Nitrogen
Company Limited ("CNCL"), a Trinidadian company in which EOG
has an approximate 16% equity interest. The construction of the
plant was completed during the second quarter of 2002.

     In April 2002, EOG, through its subsidiary, EOG
Resources Trinidad LRL Unlimited, signed a production
sharing contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago
for the Lower Reverse "L" Block which is adjacent to the
SECC Block.  EOG holds a 100% working interest in the Lower
Reverse "L" Block.

     In October 2002, EOG, through its subsidiary, EOG
Resources Trinidad-U(b) Block Unlimited, signed a production
sharing contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago
for the Modified U(b) Block which is also adjacent to the
SECC Block.  EOG holds a 55% working interest in and operates
the Modified U(b) Block and Primera Oil & Gas Ltd, a Trinidadian
company, holds the remaining 45% interest.

     EOGRT owns an approximate 16% equity interest in a
Trinidadian company named CNCL which has constructed an
ammonia plant in Pt. Lisas, Trinidad.  The other
shareholders in CNCL are Ferrostaal AG and subsidiaries of
Duke Energy, Halliburton and CL Financial Ltd.  At December
31, 2002, investment in CNCL was approximately $14 million.
CNCL commenced production in June 2002 and currently
produces approximately 1,850 metric tons of ammonia daily.
At December 31, 2002, CNCL had a long-term debt balance of
approximately $219 million, which is non-recourse to CNCL's
shareholders.  As part of the financing for CNCL, the
shareholders agreed to enter into a post-completion
deficiency loan agreement with CNCL to fund the costs of
operation, payment of principal and interest to the
principal creditor and other cash deficiencies of CNCL up to
$30 million, up to approximately $5 million of which is to be
provided by EOGRT.  The Shareholders' Agreement requires the
consent of the holders of 90% or more of the shares to take
certain material actions.  Accordingly, given its current
level of equity ownership, EOGRT is able to exercise
significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of CNCL and therefore, it accounts for the
investment using the equity method.  During 2002, EOG
recognized equity income of $0.3 million.

     Secondly, EOG, through its subsidiary, EOG Resources
Nitro2000 Limited ("EOGNitro2000"), owns an approximate 31%
equity interest in a Trinidadian company named Nitrogen
(2000) Unlimited ("N2000").  The other shareholders in N2000
are subsidiaries of Ferrostaal AG, Halliburton and CL
Financial Ltd.  At December 31, 2002, EOG's investment in
N2000 was approximately $18 million.  N2000 is constructing
an ammonia plant in Trinidad, at an expected cost of
approximately $320 million and is expected to commence
production in 2005.  At December 31, 2002, N2000 had a long-
term debt balance of approximately $7 million, the repayment
of which has been guaranteed by Ferrostaal AG.  EOG has
agreed to reimburse Ferrostaal AG for approximately $400,000
in the event that Ferrostaal AG is required to pay the debt
balance.  Upon receipt of an amendment to N2000's
certificate of environmental clearance and confirmation from
the lender that it is satisfied with the amendment, this
long-term debt will become non-recourse to all of N2000's
shareholders.  N2000 has received the amendment and is
awaiting confirmation from the lender that it is satisfied
with the amendment.   As part of the loan agreement for the
N2000 financing, affiliates of the shareholders have entered
into a pre-completion deficiency loan agreement with N2000
to fund plant cost overruns up to $15 million, up to
approximately $5 million of which is to be provided by the
immediate parent company of EOGNitro2000.  Affiliates of the
shareholders have also entered into a post-completion deficiency
loan agreement with N2000 to fund the costs of operation,
payment of principal and interest to the principal creditor
and other cash deficiencies of N2000 up to $30 million, up to
approximately $9 million of which is to be provided by the immediate
parent company of EOGNitro2000.  The Shareholders' Agreement
requires the consent of the holders of 90% or more of the
shares to take certain material actions.  Accordingly, given
its current level of equity ownership, EOG, through
EOGNitro2000, is able to exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of N2000 and therefore,
it accounts for the investment using the equity method.

     In November 2002, the EOG subsidiaries along with the
Ferrostaal AG affiliates entered into share purchase agreements
for the sale of a portion of their shareholdings in CNCL and
N2000 with a third party energy company.  EOG expects the
EOG subsidiaries to close these transactions during the
first quarter of 2003 once certain conditions precedent have
occurred.  The sale will leave the EOG subsidiaries with
more than a 10% equity interest in each of CNCL and N2000.
EOG does not expect these transactions to result in any
gains or losses.

     At December 31, 2002, EOG held approximately 194,500
net undeveloped acres in Trinidad.

     Other International.  EOG continues to evaluate other
selected conventional natural gas and crude oil
opportunities outside North America primarily by pursuing
exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous
natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified,
including the United Kingdom.


Marketing

     Wellhead Marketing.  EOG's North America wellhead natural
gas production is currently being sold on the spot market and
under long-term natural gas contracts at market-responsive
prices.  In many instances, the long-term contract prices closely
approximate the prices received for natural gas being sold on the
spot market.  Wellhead natural gas volumes from Trinidad are sold
under either a contract with a fixed price schedule with annual
escalations, or a contract that is price dependent on Caribbean
ammonia index prices.

     Substantially all of EOG's wellhead crude oil and condensate
is sold under various terms and arrangements at market-responsive
prices.

     During 2002, sales to three subsidiaries of a major utility
company accounted for 14% of EOG's oil and gas revenues.  No
other individual purchaser accounted for 10% or more of EOG's oil
and gas revenues for the same period.  EOG does not believe that
the loss of any single purchaser will have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
EOG.

     Other Marketing.  EOG Resources Marketing, Inc. ("EOGM"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of EOG, is a marketing company engaging
in various marketing activities.  EOGM enters into natural gas
sales transactions with various purchasers under a variety of
terms and conditions and supplies these sales by purchasing
natural gas from various sources, including third-party
producers, marketing companies and EOG's own production.  In
addition, EOGM has purchased and constructed several small gas
gathering systems in order to facilitate its entry into the gas
gathering business on a limited basis.

Wellhead Volumes and Prices, and Lease and Well Expenses

     The following table sets forth certain information regarding
EOG's wellhead volumes of and average prices for natural gas per
thousand cubic feet ("Mcf"), crude oil and condensate, and
natural gas liquids per barrel ("Bbl"), and average lease and
well expenses per thousand cubic feet equivalent ("Mcfe"- natural
gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of 6.0 Mcf of
natural gas to 1.0 Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas
liquids) delivered during each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002.




Competition

     EOG actively competes for reserve acquisitions and
exploration/exploitation leases, licenses and concessions,
frequently against companies with substantially larger financial
and other resources.  To the extent EOG's exploration budget is
lower than that of certain of its competitors, EOG may be
disadvantaged in effectively competing for certain reserves,
leases, licenses and concessions.  Competitive factors include
price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline
connection times and distribution efficiencies.  In addition, EOG
faces competition from other worldwide energy supplies, such as
natural gas from Canada.

Regulation

     United States Regulation of Natural Gas and Crude Oil
Production.  Natural gas and crude oil production operations are
subject to various types of regulation, including regulation in
the United States by state and federal agencies.

     United States legislation affecting the oil and gas industry
is under constant review for amendment or expansion.  Also,
numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are
authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and
regulations which, among other things, require permits for the
drilling of wells, regulate the spacing of wells, prevent the
waste of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon resources through
proration and restrictions on flaring, require drilling bonds and
regulate environmental and safety matters.  The regulatory burden
on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business
and, consequently, affects its profitability.

     A substantial portion of EOG's oil and gas leases in the Big
Piney area and in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as some in other
areas, are granted by the federal government and administered by
the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM") and the Minerals
Management Service (the "MMS"), both federal agencies.
Operations conducted by EOG on federal oil and gas leases must
comply with numerous statutory and regulatory restrictions
concerning the above and other matters.  Certain operations must
be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the BLM
and the MMS.

     BLM and MMS leases contain relatively standardized terms
requiring compliance with detailed regulations and, in the case
of offshore leases, orders pursuant to the Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act (which are subject to change by the MMS). Such
offshore operations are subject to numerous regulatory
requirements, including the need for prior MMS approval for
exploration, development, and production plans, stringent
engineering and construction specifications applicable to
offshore production facilities, regulations restricting the
flaring or venting of production, and regulations governing the
plugging and abandonment of offshore wells and the removal of all
production facilities.  Under certain circumstances, the MMS may
require operations on federal leases to be suspended or
terminated. Any such suspension or termination could adversely
affect EOG's interests.

     The MMS amended the regulations governing the calculation of
royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal
leases, effective June 1, 2000.  The new rules modified the
valuation procedures for both arm's-length and non-arm's-length
crude oil transactions to decrease reliance on oil posted prices
and assign a value to crude oil that, in the opinion of MMS,
better reflects its market value.  Two industry trade
associations have sought judicial review of the new rules in
federal district court.  EOG cannot predict what effect the
outcome of the litigation will be or what effect, if any, it will
have on EOG's operations.

     In March 2000, a federal district court vacated MMS
regulations which sought to clarify the types of costs that are
deductible transportation costs for purposes of royalty valuation
of production sold off the lease.  In particular, MMS disallowed
deduction of costs associated with marketer fees, cash out and
other pipeline imbalance penalties, or long-term storage fees.
The United States has appealed the district court ruling.  EOG
cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or what
effect, if any, it will have on EOG's operations.

     Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids by
EOG are made at unregulated market prices.

     The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in
interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act
of 1938 (the "NGA") and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the
"NGPA"). These statutes are administered by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (the "FERC").  Effective January 1, 1993,
the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 deregulated
natural gas prices for all "first sales" of natural gas, which
includes all sales by EOG of its own production.  All other sales
of natural gas by EOG, such as those of natural gas purchased
from third parties, remain jurisdictional sales subject to a
blanket sales certificate under the NGA, which has flexible terms
and conditions.  Consequently, all of EOG's sales of natural gas
currently may be made at market prices, subject to applicable
contract provisions.  EOG's jurisdictional sales, however, are
subject to the future possibility of greater federal oversight,
including the possibility that the FERC might prospectively
impose more restrictive conditions on such sales.

     Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to enhance competition
in natural gas markets by making natural gas transportation more
accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and
nondiscriminatory basis.  These efforts culminated in Order No.
636 and various rehearing orders ("Order No. 636"), which
mandated a fundamental restructuring of interstate natural gas
pipeline sales and transportation services, including the
"unbundling" by interstate natural gas pipelines of the sales,
transportation, storage, and other components of their service,
and to separately state the rates for each unbundled service.
Order No. 636 does not directly regulate EOG's activities, but
has an indirect effect because of its broad scope.  Order No. 636
has ended interstate pipelines' traditional role as wholesalers
of natural gas, and substantially increased competition in
natural gas markets.  In spite of this uncertainty, Order No. 636
may enhance EOG's ability to market and transport its natural gas
production, although it may also subject EOG to more restrictive
pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater penalties for violation
of such tolerances.

     EOG owns, directly or indirectly, certain natural gas
pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests the FERC
has used to establish a pipeline's status as a gatherer not
subject to FERC jurisdiction under the NGA.  State regulation of
gathering facilities generally includes various safety,
environmental, and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take
requirements, but does not generally entail rate regulation.
Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at
both the state and federal levels as a result of pipeline
restructuring under Order No. 636.  For example, the Texas
Railroad Commission has approved changes to its regulations
governing transportation and gathering services performed by
intrastate pipelines and gatherers, which prohibit such entities
from unduly discriminating in favor of their affiliates.  EOG's
gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be
subject in the future to the application of state or federal
regulation of rates and services.

     EOG's natural gas gathering operations also may be or become
subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the
design, installation, testing, construction, operation,
replacement, and management of facilities.  Additional rules and
legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted
from time to time.  EOG cannot predict what effect, if any, such
legislation might have on its operations, but the industry could
be required to incur additional capital expenditures and
increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory
changes.

     The FERC recently began a broad review of its transportation
regulations, including how they operate in conjunction with state
proposals for retail natural gas marketing restructuring, whether
to eliminate cost-of-service rates for short-term transportation,
whether to allocate all short-term capacity on the basis of
competitive auctions, and whether changes to its long-term
transportation policies may also be appropriate to alleviate a
market bias toward short-term contracts.  This review culminated
in part with the FERC's issuance of Order No. 637 on February 9,
2000.

     Order No. 637 revises the FERC's current regulatory
framework for purposes of improving the efficiency of the market
and providing captive pipeline customers with the opportunity to
reduce their cost of holding long-term pipeline capacity while
continuing to protect against the exercise of market power.
Order No. 637 revises FERC pricing policy by waiving price
ceilings for short-term released capacity for a two-year period
and permitting pipelines to file for peak/off-peak and term
differentiated rate structures.  Order No. 637 does not, however,
require the allocation of all short-term capacity on the basis of
competitive auctions--as had been proposed by the FERC. Order No.
637 adopts changes in regulations relating to scheduling
procedures, capacity segmentation and pipeline penalties to
improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the interstate
pipeline grid.  It also narrows pipeline customers' right of
first refusal to remove economic biases in the current rule,
while still protecting captive customers' ability to resubscribe
to long-term capacity.  Finally, it improves the FERC's reporting
requirements to provide more transparent pricing information and
permit more effective monitoring of the market.  Appeals of Order
No. 637 are pending court review.  EOG cannot predict what the
outcome of that review will be or what effect it will have on
EOG's operations.

     While Order No. 637, and any subsequent FERC action will
affect EOG only indirectly, the Order and related inquiries are
intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets,
while maintaining adequate consumer protections.

     EOG cannot predict the effect that any of the aforementioned
orders or the challenges to such orders will ultimately have on
EOG's operations.  Additional proposals and proceedings that
might affect the natural gas industry are considered from time to
time by Congress, the FERC and the courts. EOG cannot predict
when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become
effective.  It should also be noted that the natural gas industry
historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is
no assurance that the less regulated approach currently being
pursued by the FERC will continue indefinitely.

     Environmental Regulation.  Various federal, state and local
laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the
environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the
environment, affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of
their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration,
development and production operations and could cause EOG to
incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection
with a release of regulated substances, including crude oil, into
the environment.  In addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and
gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to
the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other
wastes were not under EOG's control.  Under environmental laws
and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate
wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.
Compliance with such laws and regulations increases EOG's overall
cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on
EOG's operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated,
based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required
in the near future to expend amounts that are material in
relation to its total exploration and development expenditure
program in order to comply with each environmental law and
regulation, but inasmuch as such laws and regulations are
frequently changed, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of
compliance.  EOG also could incur costs related to the clean up
of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal and
for damages to natural resources or other claims related to
releases of regulated substances at such sites.  In this regard,
EOG has been named as a potentially responsible party in certain
proceedings initiated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and may be named as a
potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the
future.  It is not anticipated that the costs incurred by EOG in
connection with the presently pending proceedings will,
individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse
effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
EOG.

     Canadian Regulation.  In Canada, the petroleum industry is
subject to extensive controls and operates under various
provincial and federal legislation and regulations governing land
tenure, royalties, taxes, production rates, operational
standards, environmental protection, health and safety, exports
and other matters.  EOG operates within this regulatory framework
and continues to monitor and evaluate the impact of the
regulatory regime when determining parameters for engaging in oil
and gas activities and investments in Canada.  The price of
natural gas and crude oil in Canada has been deregulated and is
determined by market conditions and negotiations between buyers
and sellers in a North American market place.  The North American
Free Trade Agreement supports the on-going cross-border
commercial transactions of the natural gas and crude oil
business.

     Various matters relating to the transportation and export of
natural gas continue to be subject to regulation by provincial
agencies and federally, by the National Energy Board; however,
the North American Free Trade Agreement may have reduced the risk
of altering existing cross-border commercial transactions through
the assurance of fair implementation of regulatory changes,
minimal disruption of contractual arrangements and the
prohibition of discriminatory order restrictions and export
taxes.

     Canadian governmental regulations may have a material effect
on the economic parameters for engaging in oil and gas activities
in Canada and may have a material effect on the advisability of
investments in Canadian oil and gas drilling activities. EOG is
monitoring political, regulatory and economic developments in
Canada.

     Other International Regulation.  EOG's exploration and
production operations outside North America are subject to
various types of regulations imposed by the respective
governments of the countries in which EOG's operations are
conducted, and may affect EOG's operations and costs within that
country.  EOG currently has operations offshore Trinidad.

Enron Corp. Bankruptcy

     In December 2001, Enron Corp. and certain of its affiliates,
including Enron North America Corp., filed voluntary petitions
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code.  EOG recorded $19.2 million in charges
associated with the Enron bankruptcies in the fourth quarter of
2001 related to certain contracts with Enron affiliates,
including 2001 and 2002 natural gas and crude oil derivative
contracts.  Based on EOG's review of all matters related to Enron
Corp. and its affiliates, EOG believes that Enron Corp.'s Chapter
11 proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on EOG's
financial position.

     By an order entered on June 21, 2002, the bankruptcy judge
in the Enron bankruptcy case authorized the sale of 11.5 million
shares of EOG common stock held by an affiliate of Enron.  On
November 22, 2002, the entire 11.5 million shares were sold by
the Enron affiliate to an unaffiliated broker.  EOG purchased one
million shares of EOG common stock from the broker, and the
remaining 10.5 million shares were sold by the broker to third
parties.

Other Matters

     Energy Prices.  Since EOG is primarily a natural gas
company, it is more significantly impacted by changes in natural
gas prices than in the prices for crude oil, condensate or
natural gas liquids.  Average North America wellhead natural gas
prices have fluctuated, at times rather dramatically, during the
last three years.  These fluctuations resulted in an 80% increase
in the average wellhead natural gas price for North America
received by EOG from 1999 to 2000, an increase of 9% from 2000 to
2001, and a decrease of 32% from 2001 to 2002.  Wellhead natural
gas volumes from Trinidad are sold under either a contract with a
fixed price schedule with annual escalations, or a contract that
is price dependent on Caribbean ammonia index prices.
Substantially all of EOG's wellhead crude oil and condensate is
sold under various terms and arrangements at market responsive
prices. Crude oil and condensate prices also have fluctuated
during the last three years.  Due to the many uncertainties
associated with the world political environment, the
availabilities of other world wide energy supplies and the
relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources
in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes
may occur in natural gas, crude oil and condensate, and ammonia
prices in the future.

     Risk Management.  EOG engages in price risk management
activities from time to time.  These activities are intended to
manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for
natural gas and crude oil.  EOG utilizes derivative financial
instruments, primarily price swaps and collars, and fixed price
physical contracts as a means to manage this price risk.

      Presented  below  is a summary of EOG's  2003  natural  gas
financial  collar  contracts  and  natural  gas  and  crude   oil
financial  price swap contracts as of March 13, 2003 with  prices
expressed  in dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu)
and  in  dollars per barrel ($/Bbl), as applicable, and  notional
volumes in million British thermal units per day (MMBtud) and  in
barrels  per day (Bbld), as applicable.  EOG accounts  for  these
collar and swap contracts using mark-to-market accounting.



     Tight Gas Sand Tax Credits (Section 29) and Severance Tax
Exemption.  United States federal tax law provided a tax credit
of approximately $0.52 per MMBtu of natural gas for production of
certain fuels produced from nonconventional sources (including
natural gas produced from tight formations), subject to a number
of limitations.  Fuels qualifying for the credit must be produced
from a well drilled before January 1, 1993, and must have been
sold before January 1, 2003.

     In 1999 and 2000, EOG entered into arrangements with a third
party whereby certain Section 29 credits were sold by EOG to the
third party, and payments for such credits have been received on
an as-generated basis.  In January 2003, these arrangements were
terminated.

     Natural gas production from wells spudded or completed after
May 24, 1989 and before September 1, 1996 in tight formations in
Texas qualifies for a ten-year exemption from severance taxes,
subject to certain limitations, during the period beginning
September 1, 1991 and ending August 31, 2001.  In addition,
natural gas production from qualifying wells spudded or completed
after August 31, 1996 and before September 1, 2002 is entitled to
use a reduced severance tax rate for the first 120 consecutive
months.  However, the cumulative value of the tax reduction
cannot exceed 50 percent of the drilling and completion costs
incurred on a well by well basis.

     Other.  All of EOG's natural gas and crude oil activities
are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for
and development and production of natural gas and crude oil,
including blowouts, cratering and fires, each of which could
result in damage to life and property.  Offshore operations are
subject to usual marine perils, including hurricanes and other
adverse weather conditions.  EOG's activities are also subject to
governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination
by governmental authorities based on environmental and other
considerations.  In accordance with customary industry practices,
insurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of the
risks.  Losses and liabilities arising from such events could
reduce revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not
covered by insurance.

     EOG's operations outside of North America are subject to
certain risks, including expropriation of assets, risks of
increases in taxes and government royalties, renegotiation of
contracts with foreign governments, political instability,
payment delays, limits on allowable levels of production and
currency exchange and repatriation losses, as well as changes in
laws, regulations and policies governing operations of foreign
companies generally.

until the corresponding meeting of the Board in the next year or
until a successor shall have been elected, appointed or shall
have qualified.

ITEM 2.  Properties

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Properties and Reserves

     Reserve Information.  For estimates of EOG's net proved and
proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids, including
crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids, see "Supplemental
Information to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the Form 8-K
filed on February 20, 2003.

     There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures, including many
factors beyond the control of the producer. The reserve data set
forth in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial
Statements represent only estimates.  Reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
natural gas and liquids, including crude oil, condensate and
natural gas liquids, that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount
and quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment.  As a result, estimates of different
engineers normally vary. In addition, results of drilling,
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimate.  Accordingly, reserve
estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately
recovered.  The meaningfulness of such estimates is highly
dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they
were based.

     In general, the volume of production from oil and gas
properties owned by EOG declines as reserves are depleted. Except
to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing
proved reserves or conducts successful exploration, exploitation
and development activities, the proved reserves of EOG will
decline as reserves are produced.  Volumes generated from future
activities of EOG are therefore highly dependent upon the level
of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the
costs incurred in so doing. EOG's estimates of reserves filed
with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth
in Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Acreage.  The following table summarizes EOG's developed and
undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2002. Excluded is acreage in
which EOG's interest is limited to owned royalty, overriding
royalty and other similar interests.



     Producing Well Summary.  The following table reflects EOG's
ownership in gas and oil wells located in Texas, the Gulf of
Mexico, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Utah, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and
various other states, Canada and Trinidad at December 31, 2002.
Gross gas and oil wells include 545 with multiple completions.




     Drilling and Acquisition Activities.  During the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 EOG spent approximately $836
million, $1,163 million and $710 million, respectively, for
exploratory and development drilling and acquisition of leases
and producing properties.  EOG drilled, participated in the
drilling of or acquired wells as set out in the table below for
the periods indicated:



     All of EOG's drilling activities are conducted on a contract
basis with independent drilling contractors. EOG owns no drilling
equipment.

ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings

     The information required by this Item is incorporated by
reference from the Contingencies section in Note 7 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 8-K filed
on February 20, 2003 and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.


ITEM 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of 2002.


                               PART II

ITEM 5.  Market for the Registrant's Common Equity and Related
Shareholder Matters

     The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated,
the high and low sales prices per share for the common stock of
EOG, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape,
and the amount of cash dividends declared per share.



     As of March 10, 2003 there were approximately 400 record
holders of EOG's common stock, including individual participants
in security position listings.  There are an estimated 62,500
beneficial owners of EOG's common stock, including shares held in
street name.

     EOG currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash
dividends on its outstanding shares of common stock.  However,
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends, if any,
to be declared and paid will depend upon, among other things, the
financial condition, funds from operations, level of exploration,
exploitation and development expenditure opportunities and future
business prospects of EOG.


ITEM 6.  Selected Financial Data





ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

     Information required by this Item is incorporated by
reference from pages 4 through 13 of the Form 8-K filed on
February 20, 2003 and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts,
including, among others, statements regarding EOG's future
financial position, business strategy, budgets, reserve
information, projected levels of production, projected costs and
plans and objectives of management for future operations, are
forward-looking statements.  EOG typically uses words such as
"expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "strategy," "intend," "plan,"
"target" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other
variations of them or by comparable terminology to identify its
forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or
implied, concerning future operating results, the ability to
replace or increase reserves or to increase production, or the
ability to generate income or cash flows are forward-looking
statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
performance.  Although EOG believes its expectations reflected in
forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,
no assurance can be given that these expectations will be
achieved.  Important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward-
looking statements include, among others:  the timing and extent
of changes in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and
related products and interest rates; the extent and effect of any
hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the extent of EOG's success
in discovering, developing, marketing and producing reserves and
in acquiring oil and gas properties; the accuracy of reserve
estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of
professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; political
developments around the world, including terrorist activities and
responses to such activities; acts of war; and financial market
conditions.  In light of these risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking
statements might not occur.  EOG undertakes no obligations to
update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise.


ITEM  7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

     EOG's exposure to interest rate risk and commodity price
risk is discussed respectively in the Financing and Outlook
sections of the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Capital
Resources and Liquidity," which is incorporated by reference from
pages 7 through 10 of the Form 8-K filed on February 20, 2003.
EOG's exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks and other
market risks is insignificant.

ITEM 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management and Related Stockholder Matters

     EOG has various stock plans under which employees and non-
employee members of the Board of Directors of EOG and its
subsidiaries have been or may be granted certain equity
compensation consisting of stock options and restricted stock and
units.  The following table sets forth data for EOG's stock plans
aggregated by the various plans approved by security holders and
those plans not approved by security holders for the year ended
2002.  (In thousands, except per share data.)



     Stock Plans Not Approved by Security Holders.  EOG maintains
the 1994 Stock Plan, which provides equity compensation to
employees who are not officers within the meaning of Rule 16a-1
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Under the
plan, employees have been or may be granted stock options (rights
to purchase shares of common stock of EOG at a price not less
than the market price of the stock at the date of grant).  Stock
options vest either immediately at the date of grant or up to
four years from the date of grant based on the nature of the
grants and as defined in individual grant agreements.  Terms for
stock options granted under the plan have not exceeded a maximum
term of 10 years.  Employees have also been or may be granted
restricted shares and/or units without cost to the employee.  The
shares and units granted vest to the employee at various times
ranging from one to five years as defined in individual grant
agreements.  Upon vesting, restricted shares are released to the
employee.  Upon vesting, restricted units are converted into one
share of common stock and released to the employee.

     The Board of Directors of EOG also approved a one-time grant
to non-employee directors of EOG in 1998 and a one-time grant to
non-employee directors of EOG Resources Trinidad Ltd. in 1999.
The grants have a 10-year term and vested 50% on the first
anniversary and 50% on the second anniversary of the date of
grant.

     Deferral Plan Phantom Stock Account.  EOG maintains the 1996
Deferral Plan under which payment of base salary, annual bonus
and  director fees may be deferred to a later specified date.
Participants may choose to have their deferrals of compensation
placed into a Phantom Stock Account, in which deferrals are
treated as if they had purchased shares of EOG common stock at
the closing stock price on the date of deferral.  Dividends are
credited quarterly and treated as if reinvested in EOG common
stock.   Payment of the Phantom Stock Account is made in actual
shares of EOG common stock.  A total of 60,000 shares have been
registered for issuance under the plan.  As of December 31, 2002,
29,125 phantom stock units had been issued and 30,875 remained
available for issuance under the plan.

     Other information required by this Item is incorporated by
reference from the Proxy Statement to be filed within 120 days
after December 31, 2002, under the captions "Election of
Directors" and "Compensation of Directors and Executive
Officers."

ITEM 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

     The information required by this Item is incorporated by
reference from the Proxy Statement to be filed within 120 days
after December 31, 2002, under the caption "Certain
Transactions."

ITEM 14.  Controls and Procedures

     Based on an evaluation of the disclosure controls and
procedures conducted within 90 days prior to the filing date of
this report on Form 10-K, the Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, Mark G. Papa, and the President and Chief of
Staff, and Principal Financial Officer, Edmund P. Segner, III,
have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective.  There were no
significant changes in the internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the
date of the evaluation thereof.

subsequently engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP as its independent
auditors.  The predecessor auditor's report appearing below is a
copy of Arthur Andersen's previously issued report dated February

To EOG Resources, Inc.:

generally accepted in the United States the financial statements

10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated February 21, 2002.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those

presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial
statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
