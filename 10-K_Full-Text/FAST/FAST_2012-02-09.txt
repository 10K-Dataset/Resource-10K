FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Form 10-K and other portions of our 2011 Annual
Report to Shareholders of which this Form 10-K forms a part contain statements that are not historical in nature and that are intended or may be interpreted to be, and are hereby identified as, ‘forward-looking statements’ as defined
in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the ‘Reform Act’), including statements regarding (1) the goals of our long-term growth strategy, ‘pathway to profit’, including planned decreases in the rate of new
store openings from our historic rate prior to implementation of the strategy, planned additions to our store-based and specialized sales personnel, the expected funding of such additions out of cost savings resulting from the slowing of the rate of
new store openings, the growth in average store sales expected to result from that strategy and from our more recent decision to add resources focused on specific sales opportunities and the expected timeline for achieving that growth, the leverage,
working capital efficiencies and productivity improvements expected to result from that strategy, and the growth in profitability expected to result from that strategy and the expected timeline for achieving that growth (including our belief that we
can achieve targeted profitability due to a structural lowering of our costs even if our average store sales do not grow as expected), (2) our expectations regarding sales growth and our confidence in the sustainability of that growth,
(3) our expectations regarding our range of gross margins, (4) our working capital goals and expected returns on total assets when working capital is appropriately managed, (5) our expansion plans, including our estimated 2012 capital
expenditures, the expected rate of new store openings, the expected expansion of our foreign operations, the expected opening of new distributions centers as our number of stores increases, and our ability to fund our expansion plans,
(6) markets for North American stores, (7) the future payment of dividends, (8) the expected leasing of new store locations, renewal of existing leases and expansion of owned locations for older stores, (9) the addition of new
products, (10) the percentage of net sales expected to be contributed by manufacturing and support services, (11) protection from economic downturns believed to be provided by the number of our customers and varied markets they represent,
(12) our ability to mitigate the effects of rising fuel prices by passing freight costs on to our customers, (13) the typical time required before new stores become profitable and achieve operating results comparable to existing stores,
(14) the rate of growth and variability of sales at older store locations, (15) our expectations regarding litigation, (16) our expectations regarding on-line sales, (17) our plans to introduce new industrial vending machines in
2012, our belief in the transformative nature of industrial vending to leverage our sales growth, and our belief that a local storefront combined with industrial vending provides a business model not easily replicated by our competitors,
(18) the sales growth leverage expected to result from our inventory investments, (19) our expectations regarding growth in government business, and (20) the timing of the planned completion of the warehouse expansion of our Winona
distribution center. In addition, certain statements in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, and in oral statements made by or with approval of our executive officers, constitute or will constitute
‘forward-looking statements’ under the Reform Act. Certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements are described below. We assume no obligation to
update either such forward-looking statements or the discussion of such risks and uncertainties.

CERTAIN RISK AND
UNCERTAINTIES

The following factors are among those that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the
forward-looking statements described above: (1) a downturn or continued weakness in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, changes in the expected rate of new store openings, difficulties in successfully
attracting and retaining additional qualified sales personnel, an



inability to realize anticipated savings from lowering our cost structure, and difficulties in changing our sales process could adversely impact our ability to achieve the goals of our
‘pathway to profit’ initiative and the expected time frame for achieving those goals, (2) a downturn or continued weakness in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries could affect our ability to
sustain our sales growth, (3) a downturn or continued weakness in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, a change in our current mix of products, customers or geographic locations, a change in our purchasing
patterns, a significant change in commodity prices, or increased competitive pressure on our selling prices could impact our ability to achieve gross margins within the range we expect, (4) a downturn or continued weakness in the economy or in
the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, a dramatic change in sales trends, a change in accounts receivable collections, a change in raw material costs, a change in buying patterns, or a change in vendor production lead times could
cause us to fail to attain our goals regarding working capital and rates of return on assets, (5) a downturn or continued weakness in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, a change from that projected in the
number of North American markets able to support stores, or an inability to recruit and retain qualified employees could cause the rate of new store openings to change from that expected, (6) difficulty in adapting our business model to
different foreign business environments could alter our plans regarding expansion of foreign operations and negatively impact the growth expected to result from that expansion, (7) changes in the availability or price of commercial real estate,
changes in our cash position, a change in distribution technology, or a change in our distribution model could delay the opening of new distribution centers, (8) changes in the rate of new store openings could cause us to modify our planned
2012 capital expenditures, (9) a change in our ability to generate free cash flow resulting from a slowdown in our sales or our inability to manage expenses could negatively impact the funding of our expansion plans, (10) a change in our
store format or the presence of a competitor’s store could alter our projections regarding the number of markets for North American stores, (11) changes in our financial condition or results of operations could cause us to modify our
dividend practices, (12) changes in the availability or price of commercial real estate, a change in our cash position, or a change in our business model could cause us to change our plans regarding the leasing of new stores, the renewal of
leases, and the expansion of owned locations for older stores, (13) changes in our cash position, a change in our business model, or a change in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries could cause us to alter the introduction of
new products, (14) changes in customer needs or changes in our production capabilities could change the percentage of net sales expected to be contributed by manufacturing and support services, (15) an economic downturn across multiple
industries and geographic regions could negate the protections thought to be provided to us by the number of our customers and the varied markets they represent, (16) our ability to pass freight costs on to our customers could be adversely
impacted by, in the short term, changes in fuel prices and by competitive selling pressures, (17) an upturn or downturn in the economy could alter, from historic norms, the time it typically takes a new store to achieve profitability or
operating results comparable to existing stores and the rate of growth, and variability, of sales at older store locations, (18) our expectations about litigation may be impacted by the disclosure of currently unknown facts and other
uncertainties in litigation including the possible expansion of claims brought by the claimants beyond those currently raised, (19) changes in customer purchasing practices could impact our expectations regarding on-line sales, (20) a
weaker level of industry acceptance or adoption of vending technology from what we are currently experiencing could cause us to alter our plans to introduce new vending machines or cause industrial vending to be less transformative than expected,
(21) our competitors could choose, over time, to open additional locations and to develop their own vending platform which could allow our competitors to replicate our local storefront combined with industrial vending business model,
(22) changes in governmental regulations and/or availability of government funding could result in failure to continue to grow our governmental business, (23) a decision to stock a greater amount of safety stock (extra units of inventory
carried as protection against possible stock outs) or to expand product offerings in the various geographic areas in which we operate could cause sales growth leverage expected to result from our inventory investments not to occur and
(24) construction delays could impact the anticipated timing of the completion of the expansion of the Winona distribution center. A discussion of other risks and uncertainties which could cause our operating results to vary from anticipated
results or which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results is included later in this Form 10-K under the heading entitled ‘Item 1A. Risk Factors’.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Note – information in
this section is as of year end (December 31, 2011 and also sometimes other years when indicated) unless otherwise noted.

Fastenal Company
(together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as Fastenal or the Company or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. We had 2,585 store
locations at year end. The various geographic areas in which we operate these store locations are summarized later.

Globally, we employed
15,168 people as of year end. We characterize their roles as follows:

Store and in-plant personnel

10,394

Non-store selling personnel


Distribution and manufacturing personnel

2,936

Administrative personnel


15,168

We sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion. These industrial and construction
supplies are grouped into eleven product lines described later in this document.

We operated 14 distribution centers in North America as of
year end from which we distribute products to our store and in-plant locations.

Our Internet address for corporate and investor information
is

www.fastenal.com

. The information contained on this website or connected to this website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.

Development of the Business

Fastenal
began in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium-sized, and, in subsequent years, large cities. We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of
products at convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees.

We opened our first store in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a
population of approximately 25,000. The following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years:



At year end, we operated the following number of store locations:

We select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network, population statistics, and
employment data for manufacturing and construction. Beginning in 2007, we disclosed our intention to continue opening new store locations at a rate of approximately 7% to 10% per year (calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous
year). Given the economic slowdown, we decreased this to a range of 2% to 5% in 2009, and this lower rate continued into the first half of 2010. From July 2010 to December 2010, we opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 7%. In 2011, we
opened stores at an annualized rate of approximately 5%. We expect to open 100 to 150 stores in 2012, or a rate of approximately 4% to 6% (calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year).

We stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines. Subsequent to a new opening, store and district personnel may supplement the
inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base.

We currently have several versions of selling
locations. The first type of selling location – a Fastenal

store

location, can be further defined as either (1) a ‘traditional’ store, which services a wide variety of customers and stocks a wide selection of all the
products we offer or (2) an ‘overseas’ store which focuses on manufacturing customers and on the fastener product line (this is the type of store format we have outside of North America).

In addition to the Fastenal

store

type discussed above, we also operate strategic account stores, strategic account sites, and
‘in-plant’ sites. A strategic account

store

is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers in a market. Because this location sells to multiple customers, it is included in our

store

count. A strategic account

site

is essentially the same, but it typically operates out of an existing store location, rather than a unique location; therefore, it is not included in our

store

count. An ‘in-plant’ site is a selling unit located in or
near a customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer. ‘In-plant’ sites are not included in the

store

count numbers as they represent a customer subset of an existing store.

We believe, based on the demographics of the marketplace in North America, that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least
3,500 total stores. Many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate. Fastenal has not operated outside of North America long enough to assess the market potential of those markets.



We opened the following stores in the last five years:

We plan to open additional stores outside of the United States in the future. The stores located outside the United
States contributed approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, with approximately 68% of this amount attributable to our Canadian operations.

No assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved, or that new store locations, once opened, will be profitable.

It has been our experience that near-term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations. This adverse effect is due to
the start-up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base. A new store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. As a result of this process, sales volume builds slowly and it typically
requires ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month, although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn. Of the 37 stores opened in the first quarter of 2011, 19 were profitable in the fourth
quarter of 2011.



The data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2010 to 2011 based
on the age of each store. The stores opened in 2011 contributed approximately $27,120 (or approximately 1.0%) of our consolidated net sales in 2011, with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2011.


We closed 28 stores and seven stores in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The respective average sales above were calculated assuming the store closed mid
year. The number of closed locations is noted in the table above as 2011 number/2010 number. We converted one non-store selling location to a store in 2011. We converted two non-store selling locations to a store and converted one store to a
non-store selling location in 2010.


The average sales
include sales of stores open for less than the full fiscal year.

At year end, we operated eleven distribution centers in
the United States—Minnesota, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia, Washington, California, Utah, North Carolina, and Kansas, and three outside the United States – Ontario, Canada; Alberta, Canada; and Nuevo Leon, Mexico. These 14
distribution centers give us over 2.7 million square feet of distribution capacity. These distribution centers are located so as to permit twice-a-week to five times-a-week deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by
surface common carrier. As the number of stores increases, we intend to add new distribution centers.

Our information systems department
develops, implements, and maintains the computer based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, e-Business, and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central location(s), while each store uses a
locally installed Point-Of-Sale (POS) system. The systems consist of both customized and purchased software. A dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.

Trademarks and Service Marks

We conduct business under various trademarks and service marks (see table below). We utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks, including

First In Fasteners

®

.
Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the ‘Fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our business.



Products

Our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies, many of which are sold under the Fastenal

®

product name. This product line, which we refer to as the fastener product line, consists of two broad categories: threaded fasteners, such as bolts, nuts, screws,
studs, and related washers; and miscellaneous supplies and hardware, such as various pins and machinery keys, concrete anchors, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, rivets, and related accessories.

Threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects, and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures. Many
aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities. Variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market. Therefore, we open each
store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops.

Threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90% of the fastener product line sales in 2011, 2010, and 2009 and approximately 42%, 45%, and 45% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively.

Since 1993, we have added additional product lines. These product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as the
original fastener product line. Our product lines include the following:


In addition, several service marks such as Fastenal

®

, Profitter

®

, Blackstone

®

, and Northway™ are used in several product categories.


We do not sell welding gases.

We plan to continue to add other products in the future.

Inventory Control

Our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, our sales personnel at the store, district, and region levels, and our product
managers. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores, from individual stores, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information.
The computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum level. All stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond
preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their



district managers. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced
utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory re-distribution’.

Manufacturing and Support Services Operations

In 2011, approximately 95% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry
standards. The remaining 5% related to products manufactured, modified or repaired by our manufacturing businesses or our support services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners made to
customers’ specifications. The services provided by the support services group include, but are not limited to, items such as tool repair, band saw blade welding, third-party logistics, and light manufacturing. We engage in these activities
primarily as a service to our customers and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 10% of our consolidated net sales.

Sources of Supply

We use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 1,158,000
standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. No single supplier accounted for more than 5% of
our purchases in 2011.

Geographic Information

Information regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K under the heading
‘Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data’. Foreign currency fluctuations, changes in trade relations, or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at
competitive prices and our foreign sales.

Customers and Marketing

We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations, and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees.
Most of our customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets. The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and
maintenance and repair operations. Other users of our products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. During the fourth quarter of 2011, our total
number of active customer accounts (defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days) was approximately 385,000.

During
each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales. We believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent, provide some protection to us from
economic downturns.

Store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers.
Because of the nature of our business, historically, we have made limited use of the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television, radio, and newspapers. The forms of advertising we typically use include signs, catalogs, and
direct mailings. In recent years, we have expanded our national advertising to include a NASCAR sponsorship utilizing Fastenal Racing

®

(sponsoring Carl Edwards since 2010), and in 2011 we did some limited national advertising of our FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending) through publications such as

USA Today

.



Competition

Our business is highly competitive. Competitors include both large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores. We
believe the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service, price, convenience, product availability, and cost saving solutions.

Some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses, while others rely on mail order, websites, or telemarketing sales. We, however, believe that the convenience
provided to customers by operating stores in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products, is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area, taken together with our ability to
provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers, makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products. We also believe our local storefront, combined with our FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending), provide a unique method to expand availability
and provide cost saving solutions to our customer in a business model not easily replicated by our competitors. Having trained personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete (see ‘Employees’ below).

Employees

At year end, we employed a
total of 15,168 full and part-time employees, most of whom were employed at a store location. A breakout of the number of employees, and their respective roles, is contained earlier in this document.

We believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open
new stores in new markets. We foster the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decision-making. Wherever possible, our goal is to ‘promote from within’.
For example, most new store managers are promoted from an outside sales position and district managers (who supervise a number of stores) are usually former store managers.

The Fastenal School of Business (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to
all employees. Our school of business provides core curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes
of learning. These institutes of learning are advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business. These institutes provide a focused educational
experience to enhance employee performance in relevant business areas such as leadership, effective store best practices, sales and marketing, product education, and distribution.

Our sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store, district, and regional basis, while still
attaining targeted levels of, among other things, gross profit and collections. As a result, a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume. We also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more
of the following factors: sales growth, profit growth (before and after taxes), profitability, and return on assets, and to our other personnel for achieving pre-determined departmental, project, and cost containment goals.

None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are
good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other
information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known
to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows:

A downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending, which could harm our operating results.

In general, our sales represent spending on discretionary items or
consumption needs by our customers. This spending is affected by many factors, including, among others:

•

general business conditions,

•

business conditions in our principal markets,

•

interest rates,

•

inflation,

•

liquidity in credit markets,

•

taxation,

•

government regulations,

•

fuel prices and electrical power rates,

•

unemployment trends,

•

terrorist attacks and acts of war, and

•

other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.

A downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of
profitability.

This risk was demonstrated during the last several years. As the economic condition in North America weakened significantly in
the fall of 2008 and into 2009, our customers, which operate principally in various manufacturing, non-residential construction, and services sectors, experienced a pronounced slowdown that adversely impacted our sales and operating results in those
periods. A lag in these sectors, even as the general economy improves, could adversely impact our business.

Interruptions in the proper
functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues.

The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business.
Although our information systems are protected with robust backup systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized
access, telecommunication failures, and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain
the security of the Company and customer data, could be adversely affected. Disruptions, failures, or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.

Our current estimate for total store market potential in North America could be incorrect.

One of our primary growth strategies is to grow
our business through the introduction of stores into new and existing markets. Based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in
North America to support approximately 3,500 stores. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity. In addition, a particular local market’s
ability to support a store may change because of a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store.



We may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings.

Our growth is dependent
primarily on our ability to attract new customers. Historically, the most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new stores. In 2007 and 2008, our business strategy focused on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7% to 10% each
year, although the economic slowdown in the latter four months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2% to 5% for 2009. We opened stores at an annualized rate of 7% in the second half of 2010. We opened stores at an annualized
rate of approximately 5% in 2011. We expect to open approximately 4% to 6% new stores in 2012; however, failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our long-term growth.

Our current business strategy ‘pathway-to-profit’, which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add sales personnel at a faster rate, while
successful over the last several years, has not yet proven successful on a long-term basis.

In April 2007, we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy. This strategy involved slowing our annual new store openings from our
historical rate of 13% to 18% to approximately 7% to 10%. The funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional sales personnel, with the goal of increasing our average annual per store sales, capturing earnings leverage, and
increasing our pre-tax earnings. At the time we introduced this strategy, we believed that, over the five year period from 2007 to 2012, we could grow our average store sales to $125 thousand per month and grow our pre-tax earnings as a percent of
net sales from 18% to 23%. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by temporarily slowing our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2%
to 5% and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing. Because of this economic setback, we previously indicated that the time required to achieve our pre-tax earnings percentage goals for
‘pathway to profit’ could be delayed 24 to 30 months. More recently, we have indicated we believe we could hit our pre-tax earnings percentage goal with less than the $125 thousand per month figure. We now believe the pre-tax earnings goal
might be accomplished with average store sales as low as $100 to $110 thousand per month due to the structural lowering of our costs. This could shorten the extended time line for achieving our goal to 2013; however, we cannot assure this will
occur. A more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected, the prospect of future economic deterioration, changes in the rate of new store openings, difficulty in successfully attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel, an inability to
realize anticipated savings from lowering our cost structure, and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales, capture earnings leverage, and achieve desired pre-tax
earnings results.

Changes in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume of orders could cause
our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future.

Changes in our customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or
decline. From time to time we have experienced changes in product mix. For example, marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past.
When we change our product mix, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins. In addition, gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation,
pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition, as was the case in 2009. Furthermore, reductions in our volume of purchases, as also happened in 2009, can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances.

Opening stores in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations.

We
intend to open stores in new markets pursuant to our growth strategy. New stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation, and stores in new markets face additional
challenges to achieving profitability. A new store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. In new markets, we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are
less familiar with our name and capabilities. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new, unfamiliar competitors. We cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis.

New store openings may negatively impact our operating results.

While new stores build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year
sales in new stores are low, and the added expenses relating to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings. It has been our experience that new stores take at least ten to twelve months to achieve
profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our new stores on a profitable basis.



The ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our store and
distribution network, may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement
existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition,
our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and margins.

Increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy
expenses, which may result in lower operating margins.

Costs of raw materials used in our products (e.g., steel) and energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years. Increases in these costs result in increased production costs
for our vendors. These vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. The fuel costs of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well. While we typically try to pass increased vendor prices
and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact, we may not be successful. Failure to fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the
impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins.

Our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to
staff our stores could impact labor costs, sales at existing stores, and the rate of new store openings.

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store
managers, outside sales personnel, and other store associates, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill
these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their
enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to
recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores, or increases in labor costs, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

Inclement weather and other disruptions to
the transportation network could impact our distribution system.

Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at
distribution centers or shipping ports, due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the West Coast in 2002, may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our
customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard hit regions.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and our
foreign sales.

Because the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such
as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and
our foreign sales. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar.

We may not be able to compete effectively against
our competitors, which could harm our business and operating results.

The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive. Our current
or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their product selection, financial resources,
and services. Increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices or increase our spending, thus eroding
our margins.



Our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions, political
situations, and changing laws and regulations, over which we have no control.

We obtain certain of our products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and other foreign countries.
Our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or may not be in our control or the vendor’s control, including foreign government regulations, domestic government regulations,
political unrest, war, disruption or delays in shipments, changes in local economic conditions and trade issues. Our operating results and inventory levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to
satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products.

The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply
industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business.

The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating. This consolidation is being
driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities, which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need
to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply.

There can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation. The trend in our industry
toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins. Furthermore, as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their
operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects.

PROPERTIES

We own seven facilities in
Winona, Minnesota. These facilities are as follows:


This facility is
currently being expanded to include an auxiliary building which will contain an automated storage and retrieval system with 253,000 tote locations for small parts. Its completion is planned for the third quarter of 2012.

We also own the following facilities, excluding store locations, outside of Winona, Minnesota:


In addition, this facility has an auxiliary building which contains an automated storage and retrieval system with capacity of 52,000 pallet locations
and 250,000 tote locations for small parts.


In addition, this
facility contains an automated storage and retrieval system with capacity of 14,000 pallet locations and 42,000 tote locations for small parts.

In addition, we own 174 buildings that house our store locations in various cities throughout North America.



All other buildings we occupy are leased. Leased stores range from approximately 3,000 to 10,000 square
feet, with lease terms of up to 60 months (most initial lease terms are for 36 to 48 months). We also lease the following:


We intend to
exercise our renewal option on this facility in 2012.

If economic conditions are suitable, we will, in the future, consider
purchasing store locations to house our older stores. It is anticipated the majority of new store locations will continue to be leased. It is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular store
operations, when desirable. Our experience has been that space suitable for our needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A discussion of our
policies with respect to legal proceedings is discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis and our legal proceedings and other loss contingencies as described in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. The description of our
legal proceedings in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements to this filing is incorporated herein by reference.

In early February
2010, we received a letter from a California fastener supplier dated January 26, 2010. This letter threatened to sue us for an alleged violation of an exclusive distribution arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations.
In addition to the letter, this supplier provided a press release and a video regarding the claim that they threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim. Shortly after receipt of this letter, we performed a preliminary
internal review to understand (1) who this supplier was and (2) the nature of our relationship with this supplier. Based on that review, we determined that this supplier manufactures a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of
purchases by us, from all suppliers, over the purported term of the alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener did not exceed $1 million. Following completion of our preliminary internal review, we requested additional
information and documentation from the supplier. The supplier’s response failed to provide the requested information and documentation. By letter dated February 26, 2010, we quantified for the supplier our total volume of purchases as
discussed above and informed the supplier that we believed their claim was grossly exaggerated and completely unsupported. We have not received any direct response to our February 26, 2010 letter. On May 3, 2010, this supplier filed suit
in Arkansas federal court alleging damages. In response, we filed a motion to dismiss. This motion to dismiss was denied on August 16, 2010. We subsequently filed two motions for summary judgment. The first summary judgment motion was partially
denied.

On August 24, 2011, the court issued an order granting Fastenal’s second motion for summary judgment in its entirety. On
September 8, 2011, this supplier filed an appeal in connection with the order granting Fastenal’s second motion for summary judgment. On December 16, 2011, the court issued an order granting, in part, Fastenal’s request to
recover on its Bill of Costs and Petition for Attorney’s Fees from this supplier, which order this supplier appealed on January 9, 2012. Both appealed orders are pending. Based on current information, we believe the prospect that we will
incur a material liability as a result of this claim is remote. While we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of



the Securities and Exchange Commission, we initially disclosed the existence of this threat in February 2010 (in our 2009 annual report on Form 10-K) as we believed that disclosure was prudent
due to the alleged amount ($180 million) of the claim and the threat to make these allegations public.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is management’s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results
during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (Dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted.)



BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW:

Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We distribute these supplies through a network of approximately 2,600 company owned stores. Most
of our customers are in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and maintenance and repair operations (MRO). The non-residential construction market
includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. Other users of our product include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades.
Geographically, our stores and customers are primarily located in North America.

Like most industrial and construction centric organizations,
we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years. The third quarter of 2008 included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices (approximately 50% of our sales consist of some type of fastener –
nuts, bolts, screws, etc. – most of which are made of steel) and energy prices (a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across North
America).

In the fourth quarter of 2008, and throughout much of 2009, this inflation turned to deflation. When the swings are dramatic, this
can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices. This hurt our gross margins in 2009. The drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief, but it was small in comparison to the
impact of deflation. The deflation of 2009 ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to recover in 2010 and 2011. (See later discussion on gross margins.)

The discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during 2011. This information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year.
However, we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes, sequential trends, and end market information that follow – they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty.

Over the last several years, we have continued to make significant investments in (1) store locations, (2) national
accounts, (3) government sales, (4) internal manufacturing support, (5) international operations (now over 10% of our sales), (6) FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending), (7) product expansion (with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive
brands), and (8) additional sales specialists to support safety products, metalworking products, and our manufacturing operations. We are excited about the prospects of each.

As always, the ‘pathway to profit’ is the cornerstone of our business evolution, and it influences everything we do. Remember, our business centers on our 2,600 stores – their individual
success leads to the success of the entire organization over time. As always, we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of

Growth through Customer Service

SALES GROWTH:

Net sales and growth
rates in net sales were as follows:

Percentage change

%

17.6

%

-17.5

%

The increase in net sales in 2011 came primarily from higher unit sales. Our growth in net sales was
impacted by price changes in our products, but the impact was limited. Our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services, but was helped by initiatives such as FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending). The higher unit sales resulted primarily from
increases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document) and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years. The growth in net sales at the older store locations was helped by
the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment, an environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008. The change in currencies in foreign countries (primarily Canada) relative to the United States dollar improved our daily sales
growth rate by 0.7% in 2011.



The increase in net sales in 2010 came primarily from higher unit sales. Our growth in net sales was not
meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services. The higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and
again later in this document) and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years. The growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment, an
environment which dramatically worsened late in 2008. The increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the Canadian currency relative to the United States dollar and from our Holo-Krome business, which we acquired in December 2009.
These two items added approximately 0.7 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, to our growth in 2010.

The decrease in net sales in 2009
came primarily from lower unit sales, the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes, particularly in our steel based products. Our sales change in 2009 was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services. The
lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations (discussed below and again later in this document); this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years. The decrease in sales at older
store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in 2008 and the first part of 2009.

The impact of the
economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group – opened 2001 and earlier, 2010 group – opened 2000 and earlier, and 2009 group – opened
1999 and earlier) and opened greater than five years ago (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier, 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier, and 2009 group – opened 2004 and earlier). These two groups of stores
are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. The stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent ‘same store’ view of our business (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group –
opened 2009 and earlier, 2010 group – opened 2008 and earlier, and 2009 group – opened 2007 and earlier). The daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows:

Note: The age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year.

Stores opened in 2011 contributed approximately $27,120 (or 1.0%) to 2011 net sales. Stores opened in 2010 contributed approximately $78,458 (or 2.8%) to
2011 net sales and approximately $22,040 (or 1.0%) to 2010 net sales. The rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years, and, as stated earlier, the sales generated at our older store
locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores.

The approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows:

COMMENTS REGARDING MONTHLY SALES CHANGES, SEQUENTIAL TRENDS, AND END MARKET PERFORMANCE

Note – Daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period.

This section focuses on three distinct views of our business – monthly sales changes, sequential trends, and end market performance. The first
discussion regarding

monthly sales changes

provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores. The second discussion provides a framework for understanding the

sequential trends

(that is, comparing a period
to the immediately preceding period) in our business. Finally, we believe the third discussion regarding

end market performance

provides insight into activities with our various types of customers.

MONTHLY SALES CHANGES:

The growth in 2010 and 2011 generally continues the improving trend we saw in the latter half of 2009. The negative
growth in 2009 relates to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. The change in currencies in foreign countries (primarily Canada) relative to the United States dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by 0.7% during 2011.

Stores opened greater than five years –

The impact of the economy, over time, is best reflected in the growth
performance of our stores opened greater than five years (store sites opened as follows: 2011 group – opened 2006 and earlier, 2010 group – opened 2005 and earlier, and 2009 group – opened 2004 and earlier). This group is more
cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. During each of the twelve months in 2011, 2010, and 2009, the stores opened greater than

five

years had daily sales growth rates of (compared to the comparable
month in the preceding year):

SEQUENTIAL TRENDS:

We find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway –

This stairway has several predictable landings where there is a
pause in the sequential gain (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.



History has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to
months with impaired business days (certain holidays). The first landing centers on Easter, which alternates between March and April (Easter occurred in April in both 2011 and 2010), the second landing centers on July 4

th

, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its
seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the Christmas / New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.

The table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales. The line labeled ‘Past’ is an historical average of our
sequential daily sales change for the period 1998 to 2003. We chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics, a weaker industrial economy in North America, and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line. The ‘2010’
and ‘2011’ lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes. The ‘10Delta’ line is the difference between the ‘Past’ and ‘2010’; similarly, the ‘11Delta’ is the difference between the
‘Past’ and ‘2011’.

(1)

The January figures represent the percentage change from the previous October, whereas the remaining figures represent the percentage change from the previous month.

During 2010 and 2011, sales were strong—our business has closely followed the trend line since the fall of 2009. The
months of February 2011 and 2010 were both negatively impacted by weather.

A graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed
above, starting with a base of ‘100’ in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows:



END MARKET PERFORMANCE:

Fluctuations in end market business –

The sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets. To place this in perspective – approximately 50% of our
business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing. The daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (when compared to the same quarter in the previous year), and
for the year, as follows:

The 2011 and 2010 growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business (this is business where we supply
products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers) and less pronounced in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business (this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our
customers engaged in manufacturing). The 2009 contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business. These patterns are influenced by the movements noted in the
Purchasing Manufacturers Index (‘PMI’) published by the Institute for Supply Management (

http://www.ism.ws/

), which is a composite index of economic activity in the manufacturing sector. The PMI in 2011, 2010, and 2009 was as

Our non-residential construction customers have historically represented 20% to 25% of our business. The daily sales to
these customers grew or contracted in the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (when compared to the same quarter in the previous year), and for the year, as follows:

On a sequential basis, the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in May 2009 and then started to demonstrate
patterns that resemble historical norms. This reversed the negative trend which began in October 2008. This stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our non-residential construction business which weakened
dramatically in the first eight months of 2009, and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms.



A graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in 2009, 2010, and 2011, starting with
a base of ‘100’ in the previous October and ending with the next October, would be as follows:

Non-Residential Construction

PATHWAY TO PROFIT AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS:

In April 2007 we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business –

For most of the preceding ten years, we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business
(our historical rate was approximately 14% new stores each year). As announced in April 2007, we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns. We funded this sales force expansion with the
occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7% to 10% per year (see our disclosure below regarding store growth in recent periods). Our goal was four-fold: (1) to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the
new outside sales investment model, (2) to grow the sales of our average store to $125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012, (3) to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense
leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow, resulting in a growth of our pre-tax earnings to 23% of net sales by 2012, and (4) to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of
working capital (primarily inventory) as our average sales volume per store increases. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the ‘pathway to profit’ in 2009. These
changes centered on two aspects (1) temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of 2% to 5% per year, and (2) temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing. However, as
our business trends started to improve late in 2009, we began to increase our planned openings and headcount growth. (See later discussion on future store openings and on store count and full-time equivalent (FTE) headcount.)

The ‘pathway to profit’ initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business: (1) sales force headcount, (2) store (or
unit) growth, and (3) average sales volume per store, which ultimately drive our level of profitability. Our original goal was to hit the $125 thousand per month store average, and grow our pre-tax earnings to 23% of net sales, by 2012. We
previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by 24-30 months. However, in 2010 we modified our thought process around the



‘pathway to profit’ in two regards. First, the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative is slowly lowering our cost structure. With a structurally lowered cost structure and improved
gross margins, we concluded we could hit our profitability target in the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative with average store sales of $100—$110 thousand per month in 2013 (see evidence of this in our ‘Store Size and
Profitability’ table later in this document). Second, we decided to hire fewer store-based employees and instead added resources focused on specific sales opportunities, such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists
(manufacturing, government, industry focused, and industrial vending). The decision to accelerate the addition of non-store selling resources into the areas of national accounts and dedicated sales specialists reinforces our belief that these areas
represent an efficient manner to accelerate sales at existing stores.

Future store openings and increases in FAST
Solutions

SM

(industrial vending)—

In July 2010, we indicated our intentions to open 80 to 95 new stores during the second half of 2010 (or an annualized rate of 6.8% to 8.0%). During the second half of 2010 we opened 82 stores. For 2011,
we originally disclosed our intention to open 150 to 200 new stores, or an annualized rate of 6.0% to 8.0%. As the PMI began to moderate in May 2011 (see table earlier in this document), our field personnel began to slow their store openings. As a
result, we opened 122 new stores in 2011, or approximately 4.9%. In 2012, we expect to open approximately 4.0% to 6.0% new stores. We believe this is a rational reaction to the current PMI and due to the good results we are experiencing with our
national accounts and dedicated sales specialists, particularly related to our FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending) rollout (discussed below). During 2011 and 2010, we closed 28 and seven stores, respectively. These closures resulted from our belief we could better serve those local markets with a
different store footprint. We have closed 64 stores in our 40+ year history.

As was discussed at our investor day
in May 2011, we have made significant progress in the development of FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending) for our customers. We believe these solutions have the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution. Some key statistics regarding this business include the following:


This represents the gross number of machines signed during the quarter, not the number of contracts.


This represents the number of machines installed and producing revenue on the last day of the quarter.


The percentage of total sales (vended and traditional) to customers currently using a vending solution.


The growth in
total sales (vended and traditional) to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the comparable period in the preceding year.

In addition to the increases in the number of vending machine contracts signed and the sales results noted, we are pleased with the ramp-up in our ability to install machines. In the third and fourth
quarter of 2011, we installed 1,775 machines (5,642 versus 3,867) and 1,811 machines (7,453 versus 5,642), respectively, a dramatic increase over the 331 (1,515 versus 1,184) and 410 machines (1,925 versus 1,515) installed in the third and fourth
quarter of 2010, respectively.



Store Count and Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Headcount—

The two tables that follow highlight
certain impacts of the ‘pathway to profit’. Under the ‘pathway to profit’ we increased both our store count and our store FTE headcount during 2007 and 2008. However, as indicated earlier, the rate of increase in store locations
slowed and our FTE headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in 2008. In the two tables that follow, we refer to our ‘store’ sales, ‘store’ locations, ‘store’ personnel and
‘store’ profitability. When we discuss ‘stores’ in the first table, we are referring to (1) ‘Fastenal’ stores and (2) strategic account stores. ‘Fastenal’ stores are either a ‘traditional’
store, the typical format in North America, or an ‘overseas’ store, which is the typical format outside the United States and Canada. This is discussed in greater detail earlier in this report. Strategic account stores are stores that are
focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market. When we discuss in the second table our profitability as the average monthly ‘store’ sales grow, we are referring to ‘traditional’ stores. The
sales, outside of our ‘store’ group, relate to either (1) our in-plant locations, (2) the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store (including our Holo-Krome
business acquired in December 2009), or (3) our direct import business.

The breakdown of our sales, the average monthly sales per store,
the number of stores at quarter end, the average headcount at our stores during a quarter, the average FTE headcount during a quarter, and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of 2007 (the last completed quarter before we
began the ‘pathway to profit’), for the third quarter of 2008 (our peak quarter before the economy weakened), and for each of the last five quarters:




The distribution and manufacturing headcount was impacted by the addition of 92 employees with the acquisition of Holo-Krome in December 2009.



Store Size and Profitability –

The average age, number of stores, and pre-tax earnings data by
store size for the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, were as follows:

Note – Amounts may not foot due to rounding difference.

Our original intent under the ‘pathway to profit’ was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately $125,000 per month (see earlier discussion) in order to meet our pre-tax
earnings profitability goal of 23%. This would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories ($0 to $30,000, $30,001 to $60,000, and $60,001 to $100,000) to the last three categories ($60,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $150,000,
and over $150,000), and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity. Our goal today is to continue (1) to grow the business and (2) to grow our pre-tax earnings as a percent of net
sales. As stated earlier, we now believe, based on the profitability improvements noted in the table above, we can hit our pre-tax earnings percent goal of 23% with average store sales of approximately $100,000—$110,000 per month.

Gross profit –

relative to sales, was consistent in 2011 and 2010 and improved from 2009.

The gross profit percentage in the first, second, third and fourth quarters was as follows:

The fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in: (1) transactional gross profit,
(2) organizational gross profit, and (3) vendor incentive gross profit. The transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the day-to-day fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs. The
organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains. The third component relates to vendor volume allowances.

In the short-term, periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories, while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third. This impact can be magnified, as in 2009, due
to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year.

In the past, we have indicated that
we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is 51% to 53%. This is based on our current mix of products, geographies, end markets, and end market uses (such as industrial production business versus maintenance business). We
exceeded this range late in 2008, primarily due to inflationary trends in our business. The impact was evenly split between the transactional and organizational gross profit categories. This benefit carried into the first quarter of 2009, and
quickly dissipated. In the second quarter of 2009, the trend flipped to deflation and our gross margin began to drop. About 80% of this drop was evenly split between the same two categories and the other 20% related to the dramatic drop in business
volumes and the related drop in vendor incentive gross profit. In the second half of 2009, these two factors (deflation and a drop in business volume), plus the competitive environment of a severe recession, pushed our gross margin to the bottom,
and then just below, our expected range. This drop was equally felt in the three categories noted above.

Our business began to expand during
2010 and the drag on gross margins related to deflation began to subside. This allowed our gross margins to move back into the expected range. In the second quarter of 2010, we moved into the middle of our expected gross profit range as the three
components of gross profit improved, the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components. We remained in the middle of the expected range until the fourth quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our gross margin felt
pressure and dropped to the lower end of our range. This drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional margin (primarily due to changes in product and customer mix), lower vendor incentive gross profit, and lower freight utilization. The
latter two items created half of the gross margin drop and are more of a seasonal issue.



Operating and administrative expenses

—improved relative to sales in 2011 versus both 2010 and
2009.

Historically, 65% to 70% of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs. The components are:
(1) payroll (which includes cash compensation, stock option expense, and profit sharing), (2) health care, (3) personnel development, and (4) social taxes. During 2009, these components had reduced to a range between 60% and 65%
due to the factors noted below. During 2011 and 2010, this range moved back to the historical level.

The two largest components of employee
related costs grew/contracted as follows:

%

-0.2

%

-18.3

%

The increase in payroll costs during 2011 and 2010 noted above was greater than the change in full-time equivalent
headcount noted earlier in this document. This was driven by the following factors: (1) sales commissions grew (this increase is amplified by sales growth and, in the case of 2010 versus 2009, gross margin expansion, both of which have a
meaningful impact on the commissions earned), (2) total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth, (3) hours worked per employee grew, and (4) our profit sharing contribution grew. The payroll growth in 2011 versus 2010 was
amplified because there were four quarters of strong growth. In 2010, the first quarter was still at a relatively lower level of pre-tax profit. This expanded for the last three quarters of 2010.

Our health care costs in 2011 increased from 2010. Our health care costs in the third quarter of 2010 decreased from the unusual peak in the same period
of 2009. Health care costs in 2009, and the first quarter of 2010, increased dramatically due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers, increases in
COBRA costs due to changes in federal funding within COBRA, and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years. The 2011 health care costs represented a more normal level of per employee expenses, relative to 2010 and 2009.
This resulted in a lower level of growth relative to the industry.

The two largest components of the remaining costs
within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation. Occupancy expenses increased from 2010 to 2011 and increased from 2009 to 2010. The increase from 2010 was driven by (1) a meaningful increase in
utilities, (2) a dramatic increase in the amount of FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending) equipment as discussed earlier in this release (we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy), (3) an
increase in the number of locations, and (4) increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years. The selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are
included in cost of sales. Selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses for 2011 increased significantly from 2010, a sharp contrast to the prior year’s trend. Most of the components of selling transportation
costs increased at a rate less than sales growth, with two exceptions, the fuel component and the vehicle depreciation/lease payments components increased more than sales growth in 2011. This was driven primarily by the increase in per gallon fuel
costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our non-store sales personnel, particularly industrial vending vehicles.



The last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and
gasoline—

During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2011, our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately $8.6, $10.5, $9.8, and $9.8 million, respectively. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2010, our
total vehicle fuel costs were approximately $6.4, $6.8, $6.6, and $7.1 million, respectively. The changes resulted from variations in fuel costs, variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers, changes in the
number of vehicles at our store locations, and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles. These fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles (semi-tractors, straight trucks, and sprinter trucks) which is recorded in
cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses (the split in the last several years has been approximately 50:50 between distribution and store
and other sales centered use).

The average per gallon fuel costs (in actual dollars) and the percentage change (on a year-over-year basis)
for the last three years was as follows:


Average of the
four quarterly figures contained in the table.

Loss on Sale of Property and Equipment—

The loss on sale of
property and equipment for 2011 and 2010 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles.

Income taxes—

Incomes taxes as a
percentage of earnings before income taxes, were approximately 37.8%, 38.4%, and 38.0% for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. This rate fluctuates over time based on (1) the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate,
(2) the level of profits in those jurisdictions, and (3) changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions.



Net Earnings –

Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), percentage change in net earnings,
and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows:

During 2011, the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of
operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate. During 2010, the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin
percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth. During 2009, the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion.
The EPS percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2008 and 2009.

Operational Working
Capital –

Operational working capital, which we define as accounts receivable and inventories, are highlighted below. The annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows:

The growth in accounts receivable noted above is driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period. The
strong growth in recent years with our international business and with large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales.

Our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in
accounts receivable. This is impacted by other aspects of our business. For example, the dramatic economic slowdown in late 2008 and early 2009 caused our inventory to spike. This occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically
longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns. Over the last decade, we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following: (1) new store openings, (2) expanded stocking breadth at individual stores,
(3) expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers (for example, our master stocking hub in Indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from 2006 to 2011), (4) expanded direct sourcing, (5) expanded exclusive
brands, and, more recently, (6) expanded FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending). We believe these were excellent investments for our business. These investments have, and we believe will continue to, leverage our sales growth.

The discussion above covers inventory from a longer perspective; in more recent quarters, our expanding inventories are also related to (1) our
expanding sales growth trends (with emphasis on our large account business – both OEM and MRO), (2) our confidence in their sustainability, (3) international expansion, and in recent months, (4) some inflation. However, this
expansion has been at a rate less than sales growth which has allowed us to improve our inventory utilization.



As we indicated in earlier communications, our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts
receivable and inventory (Annual Sales: AR&I) back to a better than a 3.0:1 ratio. On December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a ratio of 2.8:1 and 2.7:1, respectively.

Acquisition –

On December 18, 2009, we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products (a type of fastener). The business had an established name,
‘Holo-Krome’, and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees. The business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results (there were some balance sheet impacts of the ‘all cash’
acquisition, as noted in our cash flow statement). The acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in 2011 and 2010.

The 2011 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in earnings. The 2010
decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales. The 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was unusually high primarily due to the weak economy and the
decrease in working capital needed in the business.

The approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution
center locations was as follows on December 31:

New stores open with the standard store model, which consists of a core stocking level of approximately $50 thousand per
location. This inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows.

The net cash used in investing activities and net expenditures for property and equipment both
increased from 2010 to 2011. The increase was caused by the dramatic increase in the number of FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending) equipment deployed in our business. The net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from 2009 to 2010. However, the net expenditures for property
and equipment (purchases less proceeds of disposals) increased from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to expansions at our Indianapolis, Indiana distribution center and increased spending for our FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending).

Property and equipment expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 consist of: (1) purchase of software and hardware for Fastenal’s
information processing systems, (2) addition of certain pickup trucks, (3) purchase of signage, shelving, and other fixed assets related to store openings, (4) addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment, (5) expansion or
improvement of certain owned or leased store properties, (6) expansion of Fastenal’s distribution/trucking fleet, (7) cost related to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center (2010 and 2009), (8) cost
of a new manufacturing facility for our Holo-Krome business in Wallingford, Connecticut (2010), (9) purchases related to our FAST Solutions

SM

(industrial vending), which primarily consists of automated vending equipment, and (10) cost related to the
expansion of our Winona, Minnesota distribution center (2011). Disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick-up trucks, semi-tractors, and trailers in the normal course of business, and the disposition of
real estate relating to several store locations.

An estimate of our 2012 net capital expenditures and a recap of our 2011 and 2010 net
capital expenditures is provided below. As of year end, we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures.

We anticipate
funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations, from available cash and cash equivalents, and, if necessary, from our borrowing capacity. In addition to opening new stores in the United States, we plan to continue opening
additional stores in our foreign markets.



We have future commitments for facilities and equipment and for vehicles at year end. The facility and
vehicle amounts primarily consist of future lease payments. The expected future cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows:

The fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years and, in the case of 2011, a
reduction due to stock option exercises. These items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows:

Stock Repurchase

— In July 2009, our board of directors authorized purchases by us of up to 4,000,000 shares
of our common stock. This authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors. During 2009, we purchased 2,200,000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately $18.69 per share. These
purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. We did not purchase any stock in 2011 or 2010. As of February 9, 2012, we have remaining authority to purchase up to 1,800,000 additional shares of our common stock.

Dividends —

We declared a dividend of $0.17 per share on January 17, 2012. We paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $0.65, $0.62,
and $0.36 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Line of Credit —

We have an $8,000 line of credit under which $0 was outstanding
at year end. The line bears interest at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.

Effects of
Inflation—

We noted minimal price changes in 2011 and 2010. Price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009.

Critical Accounting Policies—

Our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are considered critical
because they require subjective and complex judgments.



Allowance for doubtful accounts

– This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are
potentially uncollectible. The reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. The analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable, the financial condition of a customer or
industry, and general economic conditions. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions
worsen for our customers.

Inventory reserve

– This reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage. The reserve is
based on an analysis of inventory trends. The analysis includes inventory levels, sales information, physical inventory counts, cycle count adjustments, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Historically, results
have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.

Health insurance reserve

– This reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical
claim reporting trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.

General insurance reserve

– This reserve is for general claims related to workers’ compensation, property and casualty losses, and other
self-insured losses. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if
historical trends do not reflect actual results.

Tax strategies

– Our effective income tax rate is based on income, statutory tax
rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We establish income tax reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions
if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing. If we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit
by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly
monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit, when (i) there is a completion of a tax audit,
(ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe
that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods.

Legal reserves

– Occasionally we are involved in legal matters. The outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and
may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures. We record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known
or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be
recorded. Although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation, the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded.



New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 820).

This accounting standard update eliminates
the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a
single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. It also requires presentation on the face of the financial statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other
comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. This accounting standard update is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2012.

In August 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment.

This
update approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the
two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value
is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Proposed Accounting Pronouncements

In recent exposure drafts, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the FASB proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases. From a
lessee’s perspective, the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and finance/capital leases. In its place, a right-of-use model would be used. This proposal, as currently written, would require the lessee to
recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments. This would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could
also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized. This exposure draft is not yet finalized; however, we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and
many of our vehicles are currently leased, and those leases are accounted for as operating leases.

Geographic Information – Information
regarding our revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note 8 to the ‘Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements’. Risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading
‘Certain Risks and Uncertainties’ and ‘Item 1A. Risk Factors’.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and
manage exposure to these market risks as follows:

(1)

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates – Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary exchange
rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end.

(2)

Commodity Steel Pricing – We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners. During the
last decade, there has been nominal movement in overall steel pricing, with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the Far East markets that occurred in the late 1990’s. This trend reversed to inflation in the period
from late 2003 to the early part of 2005 and again from mid 2007 to the fall of 2008. In the first half of 2009, we noted meaningful deflation. In 2010, we noted minimal price changes except for stainless steel which did inflate. Stainless steel
products represent approximately 5% of our business. In 2011, we noted nominal price increases. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers.

(3)

Commodity Fuel Prices – We have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel; however, this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs
to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Fastenal Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fastenal Company and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business Overview

Fastenal is a leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies operating stores primarily located in North America. On December 31, 2011, we operated approximately 2,600
company-owned or leased store locations.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fastenal Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ‘Fastenal’ or by such terms as ‘we’,
‘our’, or ‘us’). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue
Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Net sales include products, services, and freight and handling costs billed, net of any related
sales incentives paid to customers and net of an estimate for product returns. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of ownership have passed, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is probable. These criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to, or picked up by, the customer. We recognize billings for freight and handling charges at the time the products are shipped to, or picked up by, the customer.
We recognize services at the time the service is provided to the customer. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded
from net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The functional currency of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into United
States dollars for balance sheet accounts (with the exception of retained earnings) using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, for retained earnings at historical exchange rates, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted
average exchange rate during the period. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders’ equity captioned accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in
foreign currencies are included in operating and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily at two financial institutions. For purposes of the consolidated statements of
cash flows, we consider all highly-liquid money market instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Financial Instruments and Marketable Securities

All financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate estimated fair value. The fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged
in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. Assets measured at fair value are categorized based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration. Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs based upon our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. In determining fair value we use observable market data when available.

Marketable securities as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 consist of common stock and debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
recorded at fair value based on current market value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings but are included in comprehensive income and are reported as a separate component of
stockholders’ equity until realized, unless a decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost is deemed other than temporary and is charged to earnings, resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the
security.

Inventories

Inventories, consisting of finished goods merchandise held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market.

Property and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on buildings and equipment is provided for using the straight-line method over the anticipated economic useful lives of the related property. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value
exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market value, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. There were no impairments recorded
during the three years reported in these consolidated financial statements.

Leases

We lease space under operating leases for several distribution centers, several manufacturing locations, and certain store locations with initial terms of
one to 60 months. Most store locations have initial lease terms of 36 to 48 months. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other build-out clauses. Any such terms are
recognized as rent expense over the term of the lease. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. Leasehold improvements on operating leases are amortized over a 36-month period. We lease certain semi-tractors and pick-ups under
operating leases. The semi-tractor leases typically have a 36-month term. The pick-up leases typically have a non-cancellable lease term of one year, with renewal options for up to 72-months.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Other Long-Lived Assets

Other assets consist of prepaid security deposits, goodwill, non-compete agreements, and other related intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net
assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. The non-compete and related intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life.

Goodwill and other identifiable intangible long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, or on an annual
basis if no event or change occurs, to determine that the unamortized balances are recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and, in the
case of goodwill, by also looking at an adverse change in legal factors or the business climate, a transition to a new product or services strategy, a significant change in the customer base, and/or a realization of failed marketing efforts. If the
asset is deemed to be impaired, the amount of impairment is charged to earnings as a part of operating and administrative expenses in the current period. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Insurance Reserves

We are
self-insured for certain losses relating to medical, dental, workers’ compensation, and other casualty losses. Specific stop loss coverage is provided for catastrophic claims in order to limit exposure to significant claims. Losses and claims
are charged to operations when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported.

Product Warranties

We offer a
basic limited warranty for certain of our products. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. We typically recoup these costs through product warranties we hold with the original equipment
manufacturers. Our warranty expense has historically been minimal.

Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation

We have a stock option employee compensation plan (stock option plan). Our stock option plan was approved by our shareholders in April
2003 and amended by our shareholders in April 2007.

The options granted under our stock option plan vest and become exercisable over a period
of up to eight years. Each option will terminate, to the extent not previously exercised, 13 months after the end of the relevant vesting period. Compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is recognized for these awards over the vesting
period.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of
being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We
record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Earnings Per Share

Basic net earnings per share is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the
exercise of stock options considered to be ‘in-the-money’ (i.e. when the market price of our stock is greater than the exercise price of our outstanding stock options).

Segment Reporting

We have determined that we meet the aggregation criteria outlined
in the accounting standards as our various operations have similar (1) economic characteristics, (2) products and services, (3) customers, (4) distribution channels, and (5) regulatory environments. Therefore we report as a
single business segment.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

Note 2. Financial Instruments and Marketable Securities

We follow a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy are as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability,
included in Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, but are based upon our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair
value.

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

The following table presents the placement in the fair value hierarchy of
assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

business on February 1, 2012. We paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $0.65, $0.62, and $0.36 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Stock Options

The following tables summarize the details of grants made under our
stock option plan, that could be still outstanding, and the assumptions used to value these grants. All options granted were effective at the close of business on the date of grant.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

All of the options in the tables above vest and become exercisable over a period of up to eight years. Each option will
terminate, to the extent not previously exercised, 13 months after the end of the relevant vesting period.

The fair value of each share-based
option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation method that uses the assumptions listed above. The expected life is the average length of time over which we expect the employee groups will exercise their options, which is
based on historical experience with similar grants. Expected volatilities are based on the movement of our stock over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury rate over the expected life at the time of grant. The dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our current dividend payout, historical dividends paid, and expected future cash dividends.

A summary of the activity under our stock option plan is as follows:

Weighted-average remaining contractual life in years

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $4,977, $0, and $0, respectively.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

A summary of the status of the nonvested shares under our stock option plan is as follows:

At December 31, 2011, there was $15,145 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options
granted under the plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 4.70 years. The total fair value of shares vested under our stock option plan during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $9,168, $1,125, and $2,080, respectively.

Total stock-based compensation expense related to our stock option plan was $4,050, $4,030, and $3,850 for 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively.

Note 6. Retirement Savings Plan

The Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan covers all of our employees in the United States. Our
employees in Canada may participate in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The general purpose of both of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings.
In addition to the contributions of our employees, we make a profit sharing contribution on an annual basis based on an established formula. Our contribution, under this profit sharing formula was approximately $7,717, $5,005 and $0 for 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively.

Income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements differs from the expected expense as follows:



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities as
of December 31 are as follows:

No significant valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. The
character of the deferred tax assets is such that they can typically be realized through carryback to prior tax periods or offset against future taxable income.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is an immaterial amount for interest and penalties, both of which
we classify as a component of income tax expense. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, is not material.

Fastenal Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, all states, and various foreign jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, we are no longer
subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for taxable years before 2008 in the case of United States federal and non-United States examinations and 2007 in the case of state and local examinations.

The accounting policies of the operations in the various geographic areas are the same as those described in the summary
of significant accounting policies. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, location security deposits, goodwill, and other intangibles. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the store from which the sale
occurred. No single customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.

Note 9. Operating Leases

We lease space under non-cancelable operating leases for several distribution centers, several manufacturing locations, and certain
store locations with initial terms of one to 60 months. Most store locations have initial lease terms of 36 to 48 months. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other
build-out clauses. Any such terms are recognized as rent expense over the term of the lease. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. Leasehold improvements, with a net book value of $2,377 at December 31, 2011, on
operating leases are amortized over a 36-month period. We lease certain semi-tractors and pick-ups under operating leases. The semi-tractor leases typically have a 36-month term. The pick-up leases typically have a non-cancellable lease term of
approximately one year, with renewal options for up to 72-months. Our average lease term for pick-ups is typically for 28 to 36 months. Future minimum annual rentals for the leased facilities and the leased vehicles are as follows:

Certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions which would become due at the
expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. The aggregate residual value guarantee related to these leases is approximately $44,948. We believe the likelihood of
funding the guarantee obligation under any provision of the operating lease agreements is remote, except for a $743 loss on disposal reserve provided at December 31, 2011. Our fleet also contains vehicles we estimate will settle at a gain.
Gains on these vehicles will be recognized when we sell or dispose of the vehicle or at the end of the lease term.

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Facilities and Commitments

We have a line of credit arrangement with a bank which expires August 4, 2012. The line allows for borrowings of up to $8,000 at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. On December 31, 2011 there was $0
outstanding on the line. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.

We maintain certain government and agency securities as
collateral for the benefit of our insurance carrier. As of December 31, 2011, the total balance of these government and agency securities was $26,845. The classification and valuation of these securities are discussed in notes 1 and 2.

During 2001, we completed the construction of a new building for our Kansas City warehouse, and completed an expansion of this warehouse in
2004. We were required to obtain financing for the construction and expansion of this facility under an Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB). We subsequently purchased 100% of the outstanding bonds under the IRB at par. In addition to purchasing the
outstanding obligations, we have a right of offset included in the IRB debt agreement. Accordingly, we have netted the impact of the IRB in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The outstanding balance of the IRB was $9,733 at
December 31, 2011 and 2010. On February 1, 2012, approximately $6,579 of the IRB became due which effectively eliminated this portion of the IRB.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in certain legal actions. The outcomes of these
legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. We
record a liability for these legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. In most cases, significant judgment is
required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Negative outcomes for our litigation matters are not considered probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.

In early February 2010, we received a letter from a California fastener supplier dated January 26, 2010. This letter threatened to sue us for an alleged violation of an exclusive distribution
arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations. In addition to the letter, this supplier provided a press release and a video regarding the



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued

claim that they threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim. Shortly after receipt of this letter, we performed a preliminary internal review to understand (1) who
this supplier was and (2) the nature of our relationship with this supplier. Based on that review, we determined that this supplier manufactures a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of purchases by us, from all suppliers, over the
purported term of the alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener did not exceed $1 million. Following completion of our preliminary internal review, we requested additional information and documentation from the supplier. The
supplier’s response failed to provide the requested information and documentation. By letter dated February 26, 2010, we quantified for the supplier our total volume of purchases as discussed above and informed the supplier that we
believed their claim was grossly exaggerated and completely unsupported. We have not received any direct response to our February 26, 2010 letter. On May 3, 2010, this supplier filed suit in Arkansas federal court alleging damages. In
response, we filed a motion to dismiss. This motion to dismiss was denied on August 16, 2010. We subsequently filed two motions for summary judgment. The first summary judgment motion was partially denied.

On August 24, 2011, the court issued an order granting Fastenal’s second motion for summary judgment in its entirety. On September 8,
2011, this supplier filed an appeal in connection with the order granting Fastenal’s second motion for summary judgment. On December 16, 2011, the court issued an order granting, in part, Fastenal’s request to recover on its Bill of
Costs and Petition for Attorney’s Fees from this supplier, which order this supplier appealed on January 9, 2012. Both appealed orders are pending. Based on current information, we believe the prospect that we will incur a material
liability as a result of this claim is remote. While we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, we initially disclosed the existence of this threat in February 2010 (in our 2009 annual
report on Form 10-K) as we believed that disclosure was prudent due to the alleged amount ($180 million) of the claim and the threat to make these allegations public.

Note 12. Subsequent Events

We evaluated all subsequent event activity and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the
financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.

Note 13. New and Proposed Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-06,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 820).

This accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components
of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. It also requires presentation on the face of the financial
statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. This
accounting standard update is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2012.

In August 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment.

This update approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to
first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines,
based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption of this accounting standard update
did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Proposed Accounting Pronouncements

In recent exposure drafts, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the FASB proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases. From a
lessee’s perspective, the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and finance/capital leases. In its place, a right-of-use model would be used. This proposal, as currently written, would require the lessee to
recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments. This would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could
also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized. This exposure draft is not yet finalized; however, we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and
many of our vehicles are currently leased, and those leases are accounted for as operating leases.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘Securities Exchange
Act’). Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we
file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure.



Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The attestation report required under this item is contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
