and uncertainties.



CERTAIN RISK AND UNCERTAINTIES

The following factors are among those that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements
described above: (1) a prolonged downturn, or further deterioration, in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, changes in the expected rate of new store openings, difficulties in successfully attracting and
retaining additional qualified outside sales personnel, and difficulties in changing our sales process could adversely impact our ability to achieve the goals of our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative or the expected time frame for achieving
those goals, (2) a prolonged downturn, or further deterioration, in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries could prolong our sales contraction, (3) a prolonged downturn, or further deterioration, in the
economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, a change in our purchasing patterns, a significant change in commodity prices, or increased competitive pressure on our selling prices could adversely affect our ability to
improve gross margins in 2010, (4) a prolonged downturn, or further deterioration, in the economy or in the manufacturing or commercial construction industries, a change, from that projected, in the number of North American markets able to
support stores, or an inability to recruit and retain qualified employees could cause the rate of new store openings to change from that expected, (5) a prolonged downturn, or further deterioration, in the economy or in the manufacturing or
commercial construction industries, a change in accounts receivable collections, a change in raw material costs, a change in buying patterns, or a change in vendor production lead times could cause us to fail to attain our goals regarding working
capital and rates of return on assets, (6) changes in our financial condition or results of operations could cause us to modify our dividend practices, (7) changes in the rate of new store openings could cause us to modify our planned 2010
capital expenditures, (8) difficulty in adapting our business model to different foreign business environments could alter our plans regarding expansion of foreign operations and negatively impact the growth expected to result from that
expansion, (9) a change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store could alter our projections regarding the number of markets for North American stores, (10) availability of cost-effective real estate, changes in our
cash position, a change in distribution technology, or a change in our distribution model could delay the opening of new distribution centers as our number of stores increases, (11) changes in the commercial real estate market, a change in our
cash position, or a change in our business model could cause us to change our plans regarding expansion of owned store locations, (12) changes in our cash position, a change in our business model or a change in the manufacturing or commercial
construction industries could cause us to alter the introduction of new products, (13) an economic downturn across multiple industries and geographic regions could negate the protections thought to be provided to us by the number of our
customers and the varied markets they represent, (14) our ability to pass freight costs on to our customers could be adversely impacted by, in the short term, changes in fuel prices and by competitive selling pressures, (15) a change in
our ability to generate free cash flow resulting from a slowdown in our sales or our inability to manage expenses could negatively impact the funding of our expansion plans, (16) an upturn or downturn in the economy could alter, from historic
norms, the time it typically takes a new store to achieve profitability or operating results comparable to existing stores and the rate of growth, and variability, of sales at older store locations, (17) a change in accounting for stock-based
compensation or the assumptions used could change the amount of stock-based compensation recognized, (18) changes in our competitors’ business models could negatively impact the growth of our market share and our ability to capitalize on
that growth in the future, and (19) a strengthening of the economy or an improvement in the manufacturing and commercial construction industries could change the impact of the Holo-Krome acquisition on our 2010 sales. A discussion of other
risks and uncertainties which could cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results is included later in this Form 10-K under the
heading entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Fastenal Company (together with
our wholly owned subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as Fastenal or the Company or by terms such as we, our, or us) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. As of December 31, 2009, we had
2,369 store locations located in the United States (50 states), Puerto Rico, Canada (10 provinces), Mexico (25 states), Singapore, China, The Netherlands, Hungary, and Malaysia, and employed 8,491 people at these store locations. In addition, there
were 3,554 people employed in various support positions. These support roles consisted of distribution and manufacturing (2,187 people) and administrative and sales support (1,367 people).

We sell industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion. As of December 31, 2009 these industrial and construction supplies were
grouped into ten product lines described further below.

We operated 14 distribution centers in North America as of December 31, 2009
from which we distribute products to our store and in-plant locations.

Our Internet address for corporate and investor information is

www.fastenal.com

. The information contained on this website or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report.

Development of the Business

Fastenal began
in 1967 with a marketing strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium-sized, and, in subsequent years, large cities. We believe our success can be attributed to our ability to offer our customers a full line of products at
convenient locations and to the high quality of our employees.

We opened our first store in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population of
approximately 25,000. The following table shows our consolidated net sales for each fiscal year during the last ten years and the number of our store locations at the end of each of the last ten years:



As of December 31, we operated store locations in:

We have closed 29 stores in our history, and of these locations, we subsequently reopened in six of
these markets when the expansion of our product line or the expansion of our distribution network improved profitability of stores in these markets. Of the remaining 23 closed stores, 21 of these stores have a store located within ten miles of the
originally closed store location.

We select new locations for our stores based on their proximity to our distribution network, population
statistics, and employment data for manufacturing and construction. Historically, we have disclosed that we intend to continue opening new store locations and expect the rate of new store openings to be approximately 7% to 10% per year
(calculated on the ending number of stores in the previous year). Given the recent economic slowdown, we decreased this range to 2% to 5% in 2009, but we expect to return to the 7% to 10% rate of annual openings in the latter half of 2010.

We stock all new stores with inventory drawn from all of our product lines. Subsequent to opening, store personnel may supplement the
inventory offering to customize the selection to the needs of our local customer base.

We currently have several versions of store locations.
The majority of our stores operate as a ‘Fastenal store’ and stock our ‘expected inventory’ format. During the 2002 to 2005 period, this format was referred to as the CSP (or Customer Service Project) format. The ‘CSP
project’ was a significant store re-merchandising project during these years.

We believe, based on the demographics of the marketplace
in North America, that there is sufficient potential in this geographic area to support at least 3,500 total stores. Many of the new store locations may be in cities in which we currently operate. Fastenal has not operated outside of North America
long enough to assess the market potential of those markets.

In addition to the Fastenal store type discussed above, we also operate
strategic account stores, strategic account sites, and “in-plant” sites. A strategic account

store

is a unique location that sells to multiple large customers and we include these in our store count. A strategic account

site

is essentially the same, but it typically operates out of an existing store location, rather than a unique location; therefore, it is not included in our store count. An “in-plant” site is a selling unit located in or near a
customer’s facility that sells product solely to that customer. “In-plant” sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store.



We opened the following stores in the last five years:

We plan to open additional stores outside of the United States in the future. The stores located
outside the United States contributed approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales in 2009, with approximately 72% of this amount attributable to our Canadian operations.

No assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will be achieved, or that new store locations, once opened, will be profitable.

It has been our experience that near-term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store locations. This adverse effect is due to the
start-up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base. A new store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. As a result of this process, sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires
ten to twelve months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month, although this time frame has been longer in the current economic downturn. Of the 33 stores opened in the first quarter of 2009, 11 were profitable in the fourth quarter of
2009.



The data in the following table shows the change in the average sales of our stores from 2008 to 2009 based
on the age of each store. The stores opened in 2009 contributed approximately $15,172 (or approximately 0.8%) of our consolidated net sales in 2009, with the remainder coming from stores opened prior to 2009.


We closed ten
stores and nine stores and converted one store and two stores in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The respective average sales above were calculated assuming the store closed mid year. The number of closed locations is noted in the table above as 2009
number/2008 number.


The average sales include sales of stores open for less than the full fiscal year.

As of December 31, 2009, we operated distribution centers in or near Winona, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Dallas, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia;
Scranton, Pennsylvania; Modesto, California; Seattle, Washington; Akron, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Greensboro, North Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas; Toronto, Ontario (Canada); Edmonton, Alberta (Canada); and Monterrey, Nuevo Leon (Mexico). These 14
distribution centers give us over 2.6 million square feet of distribution capacity. These distribution centers are located so as to permit twice-a-week to five times-a-week deliveries to our stores using our trucks and overnight delivery by
surface common carrier. As the number of stores increases, we intend to add new distribution centers.

Our Information Systems department is
responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining computer based technology used to support business functions within Fastenal. Corporate, e-Business and distribution center systems are primarily supported from a central location(s), while
each store uses a locally installed Point-Of-Sale (POS) system. The systems consist of both customized and purchased software. A dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) is used to provide connectivity between systems and authorized users.

Trademarks and Service Marks

We conduct
business under various trademarks and service marks, including: Fastenal®, FAS-N-IT®, FNL®, Blackstone®, Rock River®, Blue Global®, Fastenal Racing®, FNL G9®, Equiprite™, Clean Choice®, Bodyguard™,
Profitter®, Dynaflo™, FMT™, Tritan™, Caliber™, PowerPhase™, and, as of December 19, 2009, Holo-Krome®. We utilize a variety of designs and tag lines in connection with each of these marks, including

First In
Fasteners

™. Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks, we consider the ‘Fastenal’ name and our other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to our
business.



Products

Our original product offerings were fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies, many of which are sold under the Fastenal

®

product name. This product line, which we refer to as the fastener product line, consists of two broad categories: threaded fasteners, such as bolts, nuts, screws,
studs, and related washers; and miscellaneous supplies, such as paints, various pins and machinery keys, concrete anchors, batteries, sealants, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut, private-label stud anchors, rivets, and related accessories.

Threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects, and in the maintenance and repair of machines and
structures. Many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities. Variations from city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market.
Therefore, we open each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allow the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops.

Threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 90% of the fastener product line sales in 2009, 2008, and 2007 and approximately 45%, 46%, and 46% of our
consolidated net sales in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Concrete anchors make up the largest portion of the miscellaneous supply items included in the fastener product line. Most concrete anchors use threaded fasteners as part of the completed
anchor assembly.

Since 1993, we have added additional product lines. These product lines are sold through the same distribution channel as
the original fastener product line. Our product lines include the following:


We do not sell welding gases.

We plan to continue to add other products in the future.

Inventory Control

Our inventory stocking levels are determined using our computer systems, our sales personnel at the store, district, and region levels, and our product
managers. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of our stores, from individual stores, and from different geographic areas. It is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information.
The computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers replenishment, or prompts a buyer to purchase, as necessary, based on an established minimum-maximum level. All stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond
preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers. Inventories in distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers. Inventory quantities are continuously re-balanced
utilizing an automated transfer mechanism we call ‘inventory re-distribution’.



Manufacturing and Support Services Operations

In 2009, approximately 94.5% of our consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards. The remaining
5.5% related to products manufactured, modified or repaired by our manufacturing division or our support services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications. The
services provided by the support services group include, but are not limited to, items such as tool repair, band saw blade welding, third-party logistics, and light manufacturing. We engage in these activities primarily as a service to our customers
and expect these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 10% of our consolidated net sales.

Sources of
Supply

We use a large number of suppliers for the approximately 996,000 standard stock items we distribute. Most items distributed by our
network can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. No single supplier accounted for more than 5% of our purchases in 2009.

Geographic Information

Information
regarding our revenues and certain assets by geographic location is set forth in note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included later in this Form 10-K under the heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data”. Foreign currency fluctuations, changes in trade relations, or fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales.

Customers and Marketing

We believe our
success can be attributed to our ability to offer customers a full line of quality products at convenient locations, and to the superior service orientation and expertise of our employees. Most of our customers are in the construction and
manufacturing markets. The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations. Other users of
our products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. During the fourth quarter of 2009, our total number of active customer accounts (defined as
accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days) was approximately 356,000.

During each of the three years ended December 31,
2009, no one customer accounted for a significant portion of our sales. We believe that our large number of customers together with the varied markets that they represent, provide some protection to us from economic downturns.

Store personnel generate a significant portion of our sales through direct calls on customers. Because of the nature of our business, we make limited use of
the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television, radio, and newspapers. The forms of advertising we use include signs, catalogs, and direct mailings.

Competition

Our business is highly competitive. Competitors include both large
distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which we have stores. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products are customer service, price,
and convenience.

Some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses, while others rely on mail
order, websites, or telemarketing sales. We, however, believe that the convenience provided to customers by operating stores in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products, is a competitive selling advantage and that
the large number of stores in a given area, taken together with our ability to provide frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers, makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products. Having trained
personnel at each store also enhances our ability to compete (see “Employees” below).



Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we employed a total of 12,045 full and part-time employees, 8,491 of whom were employed at a store location, 2,187 of whom were employed in one of our distribution centers,
manufacturing operations, or service operations, and the remaining 1,367 of whom were employed at one of our administrative support facilities or home office.

We believe the quality of our employees is critical to our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve and to our ability to open new stores in new markets. We foster the growth and
education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and by decentralizing decision-making. Wherever possible, promotions are from within our organization. For example, most new store managers are promoted from
an outside sales position and district managers (who supervise a number of stores) are usually former store managers.

The Fastenal School of
Business (our internal corporate university program) develops and delivers a comprehensive array of industry and company specific education and training programs that are offered to all Fastenal employees. Our school of business provides core
curricula focused on key competencies determined to be critical to the success of our employees’ performance. In addition, we provide specialized educational tracks within various institutes of learning. These institutes of learning are
advanced levels that provide specific concentrations of education and development and have been designed to focus on the critical aspects of our business. These institutes provide a focused educational experience to enhance employee performance in
relevant business areas such as leadership, effective store best practices, sales and marketing, product education, and distribution.

Our
sales personnel are compensated with a modest base salary and an incentive bonus arrangement that places emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis, while still attaining targeted levels of, among other things, gross profit
and collections. As a result, a significant portion of our total employment cost varies with sales volume. We also pay incentive bonuses to our leadership personnel based on one or more of the following factors: sales growth, profit growth (before
and after taxes), profitability, and return on assets, and to our other personnel for achieving pre-determined departmental, project, and cost containment goals.

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have experienced no work stoppages. We believe our employee relations are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other
information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known
to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows:

A downturn in the economy and other factors may affect customer spending, which has harmed and could continue to harm our operating results.

In general, our sales represent spending on discretionary items or consumption needs by our customers. This spending is affected by many factors, including,
among others:

•

general business conditions,

•

business conditions in our principal markets,

•

interest rates,

•

inflation,

•

liquidity in credit markets,

•

taxation,

•

fuel prices and electrical power rates,

•

unemployment trends,

•

terrorist attacks and acts of war, and

•

other matters that influence customer confidence and spending.

A downturn in either the national or local economy where our stores operate or changes in any of the other factors described above could negatively impact sales at our stores and their level of
profitability.

This risk has come to bear during the last four months of 2008 and all of 2009. As the economic condition in North America has
weakened significantly, our customers, which operate principally in various manufacturing, non-residential construction, and services sectors, have experienced a pronounced slowdown that has adversely impacted our sales and operating results. A lag
in these sectors, even as the general economy improves, would continue to adversely impact our business.

Our current estimate for total
store market potential in North America could be incorrect.

One of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the
introduction of stores into new markets. Based on a snapshot of current marketplace demographics in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in North America to support approximately 3,500
stores. We cannot guarantee that our market potential estimates are accurate or that we will open stores to reach the full market opportunity. In addition, a particular local market’s ability to support a store may change because of a
change in our store format or the presence of a competitor’s store.



We may be unable to meet our goals regarding new store openings.

Our growth, in part, is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers. Historically, the most effective way to attract new customers has been
opening new stores. Our current business strategy focuses on opening stores at a rate of approximately 7% to 10% each year, although the economic slowdown in the latter 4 months of 2008 and all of 2009 caused us to adjust this rate to 2% to 5% for
2009. We anticipate returning to our historical rate of 7% to 10% in the second half of 2010. Failure to open stores at this rate could negatively impact our long-term growth.

Our current business strategy ‘pathway-to-profit’, which involves reducing our rate of new store openings and using the money saved to add outside sales personnel to existing stores, has
not yet proven successful on a long-term basis.

In April 2007, we introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ strategy. This
strategy involves slowing our annual new store openings from our historical rate of 13% to 18% to approximately 7% to 10%. The funds saved by opening fewer stores would be invested in additional outside sales personnel, with the goal of increasing
our average annual per store sales, capturing earnings leverage, and increasing our pre-tax operating margin. At the time we introduced this strategy, we believed that, over the five year period from 2007 to 2012, we could grow our average store
sales to $125 thousand per month and grow our pre-tax operating margin from 18% to 23%. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter this strategy during 2009 by temporarily slowing
our annual new store openings to a range of approximately 2% to 5% and temporarily stopping headcount additions except at newly opened stores and stores that are growing. Because of this economic setback, we believe that the time required to achieve
our goals for ‘pathway to profit’ will be delayed 24 to 30 months. However, we cannot assure even these delayed results. A more prolonged downturn in the economy than expected, the prospect of future economic deterioration, difficulty in
successfully attracting and retaining qualified outside sales personnel, and failure to successfully change our selling process could further adversely impact our ability to grow average store sales, capture earnings leverage, and achieve desired
pre-tax earnings results.

Changes in customer or product mix, downward pressure on sales prices, and changes in volume of orders could
cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline in the future.

Changes in our customer or product mix, downward pressure on
sales prices, and changes in the volume of our orders could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline. From time to time we have experienced changes in product mix. For example, marketing activities to existing customers and needs
communicated to us from existing and prospective customers have caused us to change our product mix in the past. When we change our product mix, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins. In addition,
gross margins can deteriorate if we experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deflation, pressures on customers to reduce costs or increased competition, as was the case in 2009. Furthermore, reductions in our volume of purchases,
as also happened in 2009, can adversely impact gross margins by reducing vendor volume allowances.

Opening stores in new markets
presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations.

We intend to open stores in new markets
pursuant to our growth strategy. New stores do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing stores until after several years of operation, and stores in new markets face additional challenges to achieving profitability. A new
store generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. In new markets, we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with Fastenal’s name and
capabilities. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new, unfamiliar competitors. We cannot assure success in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis.



New store openings may negatively impact our operating results.

While new stores build the infrastructure for future growth, the first year sales in new stores are low, and the added expenses relating to payroll,
occupancy, and transportation costs can impact our ability to leverage earnings. It has been our experience that new stores take approximately ten to twelve months to achieve profitability. We cannot assure you that we will be successful
in operating our new stores on a profitable basis.

The ability to identify new products and products lines, and integrate them into our
store and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete and our sales and margins.

Our success depends in part on our
ability to develop product expertise at the store level and identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers’ needs. We may not be able to compete effectively
unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our stores and distribution network could impact sales and
margins.

Increases in energy costs and the cost of raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution
and occupancy expenses, which may result in lower operating margins.

Costs of raw materials used in our products (e.g., steel) and
energy costs have fluctuated during the last several years. Increases in these costs result in increased production costs for our vendors. These vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. The fuel costs
of our distribution and store operations have fluctuated as well. While we typically try to pass increased vendor prices and fuel costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact, we may not be successful. Failure to
fully pass any such increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins.

Our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to staff our stores could impact labor costs, sales at existing stores, and the rate of new store openings.

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including store managers, outside
sales personnel, and other store associates, who understand and appreciate our culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may
be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture
and product knowledge, our sales could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a
sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new stores. Any such delays, material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores, or increases in labor costs, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

Inclement weather and other disruptions to the transportation network
could impact our distribution system.

Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products to our store network is
an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports, due to events such as the hurricanes of 2005 and the longshoreman’s strike on the West Coast in 2002, may affect our ability to both
maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our products in
particularly hard hit regions.



We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could
increase our costs to procure products and our foreign sales.

Because the functional currency related to most of our foreign
operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business, such as sales to third party customers and purchases from suppliers denominated in foreign
currencies. In addition, fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies could impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar.

We may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors, which could harm our business and operating results.

The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry, although consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented industry
that is highly competitive. Our current or future competitors include companies with similar or greater market presence, name recognition, and financial, marketing, and other resources, and we believe they will continue to challenge us with their
product selection, financial resources, and services. Increased competition in markets in which we have stores or the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices
or increase our spending, thus eroding our margins.

Our revenues and net income may be adversely affected by economic conditions,
political situations, and changing laws and regulations in foreign countries, over which we have no control.

We obtain certain of our
products, and our suppliers obtain certain of their products, from China, Taiwan, South Korea, Mexico, and other foreign countries. Our vendors could discontinue selling products manufactured in foreign countries at any time for reasons that may or
may not be in our control or the vendor’s control, including foreign government regulations, political unrest, war, disruption or delays in shipments, changes in local economic conditions and trade issues. Our operating results and inventory
levels could suffer if we are unable to promptly replace a vendor who is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products.

The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could cause it to become more competitive and could negatively impact our business.

The industrial, construction and maintenance supply industry in North America is consolidating. This consolidation is being driven by customer needs and
supplier capabilities, which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources
of supply at multiple locations. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply.

There can be no assurance that we will be able in the future to take advantage effectively of the trend toward consolidation. The trend in our industry
toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins. Furthermore, as our industrial and construction customers face increased foreign competition, and potentially lose business to foreign competitors or shift their
operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects.

If economic conditions are suitable, we will, in the future, consider purchasing store locations to
house our older stores. It is anticipated the majority of new store locations will continue to be leased. It is our policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate relocation of particular store operations, when desirable. Our
experience has been that space suitable for our needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A discussion of our
policies with respect to legal proceedings is discussed in the management’s discussion and analysis and our legal proceedings and other loss contingencies as described in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements. The description of our
legal proceedings in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements to this filing is incorporated herein by reference.

On October 18,
2007, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Fastenal on behalf of two former employees claiming to represent all employees employed in the store position of Assistant General
Manager in the United States within three years prior to the filing date (four years for California employees). The suit alleged Fastenal misclassified its Assistant General Managers as exempt for purposes of the overtime provisions of the Fair
Labor Standards Act and California, Oregon, and Pennsylvania state statutes. This suit also alleged that Assistant General Managers in California did not receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods under the California Labor Code. An opt-in
class was certified for this action.

On August 29, 2008, we issued a press release announcing a preliminary agreement to settle the
class action lawsuit noted above. While we deny the allegations underlying the lawsuit, we agreed to enter into the settlement agreement in order to avoid significant legal fees, the uncertainty of a jury trial, distractions to our operations, and
other expenses and management time that would have to be devoted to protracted litigation. The settlement, which received court approval in 2009, fully resolves all claims brought by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit. Pursuant to the settlement, we
made a cash payment of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to cover claims by eligible class members, plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs, and payments to the named plaintiffs and their attorneys. The expense for this settlement was
recorded in the third quarter of 2008. We do not expect the settlement to have any material impact on our operating results going forward.



In early February 2010, we received a letter from a fastener supplier dated January 26, 2010. This
letter threatened to sue us for our alleged violation of an exclusive distribution arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations. In addition, this supplier provided a press release and a video regarding the claim that they
threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim. We have performed a preliminary internal review during the last several days to understand (1) who this supplier is and (2) the nature of our relationship with this
supplier. While we have had only a limited time to investigate this matter, we have determined that this supplier manufacturers a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of purchases by us, from all suppliers, over the purported term of
this alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener does not exceed $1 million. Based on our preliminary inquiry, we believe it is remote that this claim would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flow, or
results of operations. While we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of the SEC, we believe that disclosure is prudent due to the alleged amount of the claim and the threat to make these allegations public.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form
10-K. Certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding.

Business Overview –

Fastenal is a North American leader in
the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We operate stores primarily located in North America. On December 31, 2009, we operated 2,369 company-owned or leased store locations.

Most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and
maintenance and repair operations. The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. Other users of our products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state, and local
governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our customers are primarily located in North America.



Similar to our first three quarterly reports in 2009, this annual report’s discussion contains some
additional points not typically covered in our reports in previous years. We believe these are important aspects that require added emphasis.

As we saw in the previous fifteen months, the weakened economy continues to have a substantial impact on our business. These impacts continue to negatively affect our sales, particularly related to our industrial production business
(business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by others) and, as the year progressed, our non-residential construction business. To place this in perspective – sales to our manufacturing customers
(historically approximately 50% of sales) contracted approximately 10.1% in the fourth quarter and 18.8% for the year versus the same periods in 2008. This contraction is less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing sales (business
where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing), but more severe in the production business. Our non-residential construction business (historically 20% to 25% of sales) contracted
approximately 24.7% in the fourth quarter and 19.4% for the year versus the same periods in 2008. The remaining business (sales to other resellers, government business, transportation/warehousing, other industries, and in-store retail sales)
produced better results as a group, but unfortunately, doesn’t have enough impact to offset the manufacturing and construction impact. The annual 2009 sales growth/contraction compared to 2008 sales for the remaining business was as follows:
Sales to other resellers – 26% contraction, government business – 16% growth, transportation/warehousing – 3% contraction, all other industries combined – 0% growth, and in-store retail sales – 14% contraction.

On a sequential basis, our daily average sales to our manufacturing customers improved each month since May 2009 (with the exception of July and December
2009 due to the holiday impact) versus the previous month. This trend was the first sequential improvement since September 2008. However, this improvement was partially offset by continued weakening in our non-residential construction business.

Sometimes our comments are an effort to share our perspective regarding the trends with you, our shareholder. The discussion above is an
attempt to provide insight into activities with types of customers and the discussion under the headings ‘Financial Overview’ and ‘Monthly Daily Sales Change’ later gives a somewhat mechanical view of our business. Another way to
think about our business is to compare our growth during a year to the act of climbing a stairway. This stairway has several predictable landings (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October.
The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.

History has identified these landings
in our business cycle. They generally relate to months with impaired business days (i.e. certain holidays). The first landing centers on Easter, which alternates between March and April (it was in April in 2009), the second landing centers on
July 4

th

, and the third landing centers on the
approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and on the Christmas / New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the
week.

The table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales (see definition of daily sales later in this report). The
line labeled ‘Past’ is an historical average of the results for the period 1998 to 2003. We chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics, a weaker industrial economy in North America, and could serve as a benchmark for a
possible trend line. The ‘2009’ line is our actual results and the ‘Delta’ line is the difference between the ‘Past’ and ‘2009’.

In the October 2008 to January 2009 time frame, our economy dug a big hole, and pulled our sales results
from daily average sales growth of 11.9% in October to a contraction of 8.5% in January. The ‘Delta’, or spread between the benchmark and the 2009 actual, in the February 2009 to April 2009 time frame averaged a negative 5.0%. This
increased the daily sales contraction to 21.0% in April. The ‘Delta’ from May 2009 to July 2009 was not as significant, averaging a negative 1.1%; while this period was still painful, it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the
drop. Finally, in the period from August 2009 to December 2009, the ‘Delta’ improved further, and averaged a positive 0.7%. Historically, we are hesitant to provide much forward looking commentary as we believe we are better able to
provide value to our shareholders by managing the business and not by trying to predict the economy; however, our confidence in our ability to see year-over-year sales growth in the near future is buoyed by these trends.

During 2009, we attempted to balance long-term opportunities for growth with the necessary short-term reactions to the current reality. In this regard, we
previously slowed our store openings for 2009 to a range of 2% to 5% new stores and we stopped adding any headcount except for store openings and for stores that are growing. Over the last several years, our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative
has slowly altered our cost structure in that a greater portion is now variable versus fixed. This continues to help us today as we navigate through the current economic environment. As discussed in our third quarter report, we began to stabilize
our store total headcount in that quarter and in October 2009 we began the steps to increase our rate of store openings. Assuming our confidence continues to be supported by an economy that is stable, we plan to continue increasing the rate of store
openings, as we did in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the goal of resuming our historical rate of openings of 7% to 10% in the second half of 2010. This plan allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business: (1) average store size,
which ultimately drives our level of profitability, (2) store headcount, and (3) store, or unit, growth. The last two drive our ability to grow our sales long-term.

Our balance sheet continues to be very strong and our operations have good cash generating characteristics. During 2009, we tried to manage it well. During 2009, we generated $306,070 (or 166.0% of net
earnings) of operating cash flow; the comparable figure was $259,898 (or 92.9% of net earnings) in 2008. Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments; this benefit reverses itself in the
second, third, and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September, and December. The remaining amounts of cash flow from operating activities are largely linked to the pure dynamics of a distribution business and its strong
correlation to working capital.

As we planned, our capital expenditures for 2009 were down from 2008. This primarily related to the
Indianapolis, IN distribution expansion and to our new distribution center location near Dallas, TX. Most of the expenditures for these two locations occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009. As indicated in our 2008 annual report, we expected
our capital expenditures would drop from approximately $95,000 in 2008 to $65,000 in 2009. The actual 2009 figure came in at $52,538 with the difference being driven by lower capital expenditures for computer software and equipment, real estate, and
vehicles. In 2010, we expect our capital expenditures will drop to approximately $40,000. Again, this reduction is driven by a significant drop in expenditures for the aforementioned Indianapolis and Dallas facilities. This reduction will be
partially offset by some added spending for computer equipment and vehicles in 2010 and some potential real estate purchases for our manufacturing and distribution operations.

The strong free cash flow in 2009 (operating cash flow less net capital expenditures) allowed us to increase our first dividend payment (declared January 2009 and paid in March 2009) by 40% (from $.25 per
share in 2008 to $.35 per share in 2009). This strong free cash flow also allowed us to increase our second dividend payment (declared July 2009 and paid in August 2009) by 37% (from $.27 per share in 2008 to $.37 per share in 2009). Given the
economic environment, we are satisfied with our cash flow for 2009. As announced on January 18, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $.40 per share to be paid in February 2010; this represents a 14.3% increase over our first
dividend in 2009.



Financial Overview –

During 2009, 2008, and 2007, the weakness of the global industrial
environment negatively impacted our business. The impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years (2009 group reflects stores opened in 1999 and earlier) and opened greater than five
years (2009 group reflects stores opened in 2004 and earlier). These two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. The stores opened greater than two years (2009 group reflects stores
opened in 2007 and earlier) represent a consistent same-store view of our business. The net sales change for each of the groups was as follows:

Net Sales

– Net sales and percentage change in net sales were as follows:

The 2009, 2008, and 2007 percentage change in net sales reflect a weakening economy since late 2006
versus a strengthening economy from summer 2003 to late 2006 in the North American market. The decrease in 2009 related to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. The increase in net sales in 2008 and 2007 came primarily from unit
sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years, growth in our newer product lines, and new store openings.

Stores opened in 2009
contributed approximately $15,172 (or 0.8%) to 2009 net sales. Stores opened in 2008 contributed approximately $74,945 (or 3.9%) to 2009 net sales and approximately $31,917 (or 1.4%) to 2008 net sales. The rate of growth in sales of store locations
generally levels off after they have been open for five years, and, as stated earlier, the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores.

Monthly Daily Sales Change –

Our business had daily sales changes (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year) as follows:

Note: Daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of
business days in a period.



The growth in 2007 generally represents a weakening environment which began in late 2006. The final three
months of 2007 continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 13.7%. Generally speaking, this improvement in late 2007 remained in the first nine
months of 2008 and weakened in the October 2008 to December 2008 time frame. The slow-down in the final three months of 2008 and all of 2009 relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. Note – see our discussion by
customer type and about sequential trends earlier in this report.

Impact of Fuel Prices –

Rising fuel prices negatively impacted
2007 and 2008; however, we did feel some relief in the final months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarter of 2009, our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately $1.7 million, $1.9
million, $2.1 million, and $2.0 million per month, respectively. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarter of 2008, our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately $2.9 million, $3.7 million, $3.7 million, and $2.4 million per month,
respectively. The changes resulted from variations in fuel costs, the freight initiative discussed below, a reduction in sales volume, and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support sales personnel and to support additional store
locations. These fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles (semi-tractors, straight trucks, and sprinter trucks) which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in
operating and administrative expenses (the split in the last several years has been approximately 50:50 between distribution and store use).

In 2005, we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance. The freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the Fastenal trucking network
(which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes) and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units. This initiative positively impacted our business
over the last several years despite the increases in average per gallon fuel costs during several of those years. The following table indicates changes in average per gallon fuel costs during 2007, 2008, and 2009:



Gross Profit Margins –

Gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows:


50.9

%


52.8

%


50.8

Gross profit margin percentage decreased from 2008 to 2009. The gross margin change was driven by
different factors during 2009 versus 2008. Historically our gross margins have been driven by several factors: (1) a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin,
(2) a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost which can provide short term inflation margin, (3) improvements in our direct sourcing operations, (4) continued focus on our freight initiative (discussed
earlier), and (5) continued focus on our product availability within our network. This product availability focus centers on our ‘master stocking hub’ in Indianapolis, Indiana, and our efficient ability to pull product from
store-to-store. However, in 2009, the inflation margin noted in item (2) reversed from an inflation gain to a deflation loss as higher cost product purchased in 2008, which turned through our system slower than anticipated, was sold against
deflationary selling prices in 2009 and the competitive marketplace caused the margin on recently purchased product to drop due to added pressure on selling prices. These two issues continued to worsen during the latter half of 2009; with August
2009 being the worst month. The gross margin in 2009 was also impacted by reductions in vendor volume allowances due to the reductions in purchase volumes with our vendors relative to the prior year and due to our decision to purposely forego
potential volume rebates in an effort to continue to aggressively manage our inventory levels. We were disappointed by the 2009 decrease in gross margins; however, we believe the reasons noted above are short-term in nature and we remain confident
in our ability to improve gross margins in 2010.

Gross profit margins for 2008 increased over 2007. The improvement was driven by the five
historical factors noted above.

Operating and Administrative Expenses –

Operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net
sales were as follows:


35.6

%


33.6

%


32.6

%

Operating and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased 12.6% from 2008. The decrease was primarily
driven by (1) payroll and related costs, which contracted due to reduced headcount and due to decreased incentive compensation due to our sales and gross margin decline and (2) transportation costs, which contracted due to decreasing fuel
costs. As the economy dramatically weakened in October 2008, we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth continued to weaken. We were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses
during the fourth quarter of 2008 and all of 2009. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 13.2% from the fourth quarter of 2008.

Operating and administrative expenses in 2008 grew 17.0% over 2007. While this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of 13.5%, at that time it represented the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history. The growth
was primarily driven by (1) payroll and related costs, which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement; (2) transportation costs, which expanded due to rising fuel costs; and (3) our
legal settlement described earlier in this Form 10-K. As indicated above, the economy dramatically weakened in October 2008; therefore, we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth. We were pleased with our ability to rein
in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 grew 11.0% over the fourth quarter of 2007.



The operating and administrative expenses for 2009 include $3,850 of compensation expense related to stock
options. During 2008 and 2007, this expense was $3,247 and $1,915, respectively. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was driven by stock option grants in April 2009 and 2008. The options issued in 2007, 2008, and 2009 vest over a five to eight year
period. We estimate the three option grants, when combined, will result in compensation expense of approximately $330 per month for the next four years, dropping slightly in the remaining period. No other stock options were outstanding during these
periods.

Payroll & Related Costs –

Payroll and related costs represented approximately 63%, 65%, and 67% of operating
and administrative expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Our net payroll cost for 2009 decreased approximately 18.3% from 2008. The disparity between the 10.8% full-time equivalent headcount decline (noted below) from 2008 to 2009 and the
18.3% expense decline is driven by several factors: (1) contractions in sales commissions earned, (2) contractions in bonuses earned, (3) reductions of hours worked per employee and of temporary labor, and (4) a reduction of the
profit sharing contribution earned. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in stock option expense noted above and the increase in health care costs noted below. As we have indicated in the past, our regional leaders, district managers,
store managers, and other sales personnel are rewarded for, among other things, growth in sales, gross profit dollars, and pre-tax earnings. The negative growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31,
2009, when compared to the growth rates in the same periods of 2008, drove the contractions noted in (1), (2), and (4) above. Our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased approximately 21.1% over the fourth quarter of 2008.

Our net payroll cost for 2008 increased approximately 14.1% over 2007. Our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased
approximately 7.2% over the fourth quarter of 2007. The disparity between the 9.2% full-time equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 7.2% expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses
earned during the final quarter of 2008.

In 2009, payroll and related costs decreased at a rate faster than net sales due to a decrease in
our gross margin percentage from 2008 to 2009 (see earlier discussion). In 2008, payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year. In
2007, payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales. Effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively.

The following sets forth the average number of employees (numbers are presented on a full-time equivalent basis) for each of 2009, 2008, and 2007:



The rate of decrease in store personnel in 2009 was slower than the rate of change in sales due to
(1) a 3.0% increase in the number of store locations, and (2) our attempt to balance selling activities versus cost controls. The rate of increase in store personnel in 2008 was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional
personnel added as part of our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative discussed below. The decrease in ‘distribution and manufacturing’ and ‘administrative and sales support’ personnel from the beginning of 2007 to the end of
2009 was amplified by the weak selling environment in 2009, but generally related to the tight management of headcount growth for these personnel since early 2007 when we first introduced our ‘pathway to profit’ initiative discussed
elsewhere in this report. The two-year percentage change noted above was included to emphasize the impact of the ‘pathway to profit’ initiative on the relative changes between the different types of personnel.

Two components of employee related costs did increase from 2008 to 2009 – health care costs and stock option expense. The health care costs for the
fourth quarter of 2009 increased 52.4% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and 31.4% from the third quarter of 2009. For the year, health care costs increased 24.1%. The increase is due to rising health care costs and the increase in the percentage of
employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses have lost their insurance coverage at other employers due to the current economic environment. Our health benefits program is essentially a self-insured plan, and as the claim activity
escalated during the year, we were caught by surprise in the final four to five months of the year due to the magnitude of the increase. With the benefit of hindsight, we underestimated three factors: (1) the impact of the shift in the mix of
our participants noted above, (2) the impact of the gap between the expenses associated with providing COBRA benefits versus the funds received from the participants and/or the federal government, and (3) the increase in health care
utilization when compared to previous years.

We were pleased with our organization’s ability to manage payroll and related costs in
2009, 2008, and 2007, while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately $5,207 and $4,743 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, to our employees’ 401(k) plan accounts or Registered Retirement Savings Plan accounts in the case
of our Canadian employees. Unfortunately, our operating results did not allow for a profit sharing contribution in 2009.

Occupancy Costs

– Occupancy costs represented approximately 20.4%, 17.3%, and 18.4% of operating expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Occupancy expenses grew approximately 3.1% from 2008 to 2009. The annual increase in occupancy was driven by a
2.5% net increase in the number of store locations, which was partially offset by reductions in rent expense at existing stores, by the relocation of approximately 4% of our stores, and by the depreciation impact of our new or expanded facilities in
Dallas, Texas and Indianapolis, Indiana. Occupancy expenses grew approximately 9.9% from 2007 to 2008. In 2008, we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade. Occupancy costs in 2008 and 2007 increased
due to: (1) a 7.5% and 8.1% net increase in the number of store locations in 2008 and 2007, respectively, (2) the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative (formerly referred to as CSP), and (3) the
relocation of existing stores. During 2008 and 2007, we relocated approximately 5% and 8% of our stores, respectively.

Transportation
Costs –

Transportation costs represented approximately 5.1%, 5.4%, and 5.0% of operating expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Net transportation costs decreased 18.3% from 2008 to 2009. The 2009 decrease was primarily driven by
lower gasoline prices and by the stabilization in the sales price of our vehicles for sale.

In 2008, transportation was one component of
operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful de-leverage. Our transportation costs grew approximately 26.7% from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the
increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force.

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Property, Plant, and Equipment –

The loss on sale of property and equipment for 2009 and 2008 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles. The 2008 number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our Dallas, Texas distribution center.

Income taxes –

Incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, were approximately 38.0%, 38.0%, and 38.4% for 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. This rate fluctuates over time based on (1) the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, (2) the level of profits in those jurisdictions, and (3) changes in tax law and regulations in
those jurisdictions.



Net Earnings –

Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), percentage change in net earnings,
and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows:

During 2009, the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously
mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion. During 2008, the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our
occupancy expenses. During 2007, the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins. The EPS percentage
change rate was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

Working Capital –

Two
components of working capital, accounts receivable and inventories, are highlighted below. The annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows:

These two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital. These initiatives
include (1) the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management (this facility became operational early in 2005) and (2) the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either
expected store inventory, new expanded inventory, inventory necessary for upcoming store openings, or inventory necessary for our ‘master stocking hubs’.

The accounts receivable decrease of 12.6% from December 2008 to December 2009 was the result of a daily sales decrease of 12.0% and 8.6% in November and December 2009, respectively. The accounts
receivable increase of 3.6% from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 relates to a daily sales increase of 6.8% and 0.0% in November and December 2008, respectively. A portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our
ability to foresee sales trends; therefore, the drop in sales growth activity late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and during the first quarter of 2009 continued to result in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product, with
the exception of March 2009. The inventory decrease noted in March 2009 continued through most of 2009. Our inventory dropped approximately $9,000, $36,000, and $21,000 during the first, second, and third quarters of 2009, respectively. The
inventory grew by approximately $10,000 in the fourth quarter; approximately half of this increase related to our December 2009 acquisition of Holo-Krome (discussed later) and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our
distribution centers to support the improving sales trends we have seen since August 2009.



As we indicated in earlier communications, our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts
receivable and inventory (Annual Sales: AR&I) back to a better than a 3.0:1 ratio. On December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a ratio of 2.7:1 and 2.9:1, respectively.

Pathway to Profit –

During April 2007, we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business. For most of the last decade, we used store openings as the primary growth driver
of our business (our historical rate was approximately 14% new stores each year). As announced in April 2007, we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns. We funded this sales force
expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7% to 10% per year (we opened approximately 3.0%, 7.5% and 8.1% new stores in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively; see also our disclosure above regarding the
expected rate of 2010 store openings). At the time it was announced our goal with this strategy was four-fold: (1) to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model, (2) to grow the sales of our
average store to $125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012, (3) to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as
their sales grow, and (4) to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital (primarily inventory) as our average store size increases. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of
2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the ‘pathway to profit’ during 2009. These changes center on two aspects (1) temporarily slowing store openings to a range of 2% to 5% (see earlier comments), and (2) stopping
headcount additions except for store openings and for stores that are growing (see earlier comments). We believe this economic setback will impact the timing of when we achieve the $125 thousand per month average by 24 to 30 months. However, the
current economic weakness only serves to strengthen our belief in the ‘pathway to profit’.

Since first implementing the
‘pathway to profit’, we have increased our store count and our store full-time equivalent (FTE) head count. However, the rate of increase in store locations has slowed and FTE headcount for all types of personnel has been reduced since the
economy weakened late in 2008. The percentage change (year-over-year) since the fourth quarter of 2008 in the number of stores at quarter end and in the average FTE per quarter were as follows:

While we have reduced our FTE headcount at our store locations, much of this relates to a reduction
in part-time hours worked as our absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel have remained more stable. We believe this allows us to manage our expense in the short-term while maintaining our ability to sell into the marketplace. The
percentage change (year-over-year) since the fourth quarter of 2008 in the absolute store personnel headcount at quarter end were as follows:

December

Since March 2007, the month before announcing the ‘pathway to profit’, and December 2009, our
absolute headcount and FTE headcount have changed as follows:

Store Size and Profitability –

The store groups listed in the table below, when combined
with our strategic account stores, represented approximately 87% to 89% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007. Strategic account stores, which numbered 27, 20, and 14 in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively,
are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market. Our remaining sales (approximately 11% to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007) relate to either: (1) our in-plant
locations, (2) our direct Fastenal Cold Heading business (including our new Holo-Krome business discussed under ‘Acquisition’ below), or (3) our direct import business. Our average store, excluding the business not sold through a
store, had sales of $58,100, $70,200, and $72,500 per month in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The average age, number of stores, and pre-tax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively, were as follows:

Three months ended December 31, 2009

Three months ended December 31, 2008



Three months ended December 31, 2007

As we indicated earlier in this report, our goal is to increase the sales of our average store to
approximately $125,000 per month. This will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories ($0 to $30,000, $30,001 to $60,000, and $60,001 to $100,000) to the last three categories ($60,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $150,000, and over
$150,000), and we believe will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity.

Note – Dollar amounts in this
section are presented in whole dollars, not thousands.

Acquisition –

On December 18, 2009, we purchased certain assets of a
domestic manufacturer of socket products (a type of fastener). The business has an established name, ‘Holo-Krome’, and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees. We believe this business will be a good
addition to serving the needs of our customers. The business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results (there were some balance sheet impacts of the ‘all cash’ acquisition, as noted in our cash flow statement). The
acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall sales in 2010.

The 2009 decrease in investing activities from 2008 is primarily due to the decrease in property and
equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in 2009 of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center which occurred in
2008, and the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of short-term marketable securities in 2009.

The 2008 increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the
expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center, the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center noted above.

Property and equipment expenditures in 2009, 2008 and 2007 consist of: (1) the purchase of software and hardware for Fastenal’s information
processing systems, (2) the addition of certain pickup trucks, (3) the purchase of signage, shelving, and other fixed assets related to store openings, (4) the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment, (5) the expansion
or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties, (6) the expansion of Fastenal’s distribution/trucking fleet, (7) the cost related to the relocation of our new Dallas, Texas distribution center (2007 and 2008), (8) the
cost related to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center (2008 and 2009), and (9) the cost of a new manufacturing facility in Rockford, Illinois (2008). Disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned
disposition of certain pick-up trucks, semi-tractors, and trailers in the normal course of business, the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and, in the case of 2008, the disposal of our former Dallas, Texas distribution
center.

We expect to incur approximately $40,000 in total capital expenditures in 2010, consisting of approximately $11,000 for
manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment and facilities, $5,000 for shelving and related supplies for our store openings and ‘a la carte’ store expansions, $11,000 for data processing equipment, $10,000 for real estate and
improvement to store buildings, and $3,000 for vehicles. We have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future. As of December 31, 2009, we had no material
outstanding commitments for capital expenditures.

We anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations, from
available cash and cash equivalents, and, if necessary, from our borrowing capacity. In addition to opening new stores in the United States, we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets.



We have future commitments for leased facilities and for leased vehicles at December 31, 2009. The
future contractual cash obligations related to the commitments are as follows:

The fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years. These
items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows:

Stock Repurchase

— On July 10, 2009, we issued a press release announcing our board
of directors had authorized purchases by us of up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. This authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors. During 2009, we purchased 1,100,000 shares of our
outstanding stock at an average price of approximately $37.37 per share. These purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. With the new authorization in 2009, we have remaining authority to purchase up to 900,000 additional shares of our
common stock.

Dividends —

We declared a semi-annual dividend of $.40 per share on January 18, 2010. We paid aggregate annual
dividends per share of $.72, $.79, and $.44 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Line of Credit —

We have an $8,000 line of
credit under which $0 was outstanding at December 31, 2009. The line bears interest at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.

Effects of Inflation—

Price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009. Price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008 and
2007.

Critical Accounting Policies—

Our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our
consolidated financial statements. These estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments.



Allowance for doubtful accounts

– This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are
potentially uncollectible. The reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. The analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable, the financial condition of a customer or
industry, and general economic conditions. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions
worsen for our customers.

Inventory reserve

– This reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage. The reserve is
based on an analysis of inventory trends. The analysis includes inventory levels, sales information, physical inventory counts, cycle count adjustments, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Historically, results
have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.

Health insurance reserve

– This reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical
claim reporting trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.

General insurance reserve

– This reserve is for general claims related to workers’ compensation, property and casualty losses, and other
self-insured losses. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if
historical trends do not reflect actual results.

Tax Strategies

– Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates
and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions if challenged may
or may not result in us prevailing. These reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,

Income Taxes

(ASC 740). Under this guidance, if we determine that a tax position
is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions and ASC 740 tax liabilities. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax
positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit, when (i) there is a completion of a tax audit, (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or
(iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing
authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.

Legal
Reserves

– Occasionally we are involved in legal matters. The outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages that could
require significant expenditures. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-10-05

Contingencies

, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably
possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and
timing of a loss to be recorded. Although we believe we have adequately provided for probably losses from litigation, the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially difference from reserves recorded.



Geographic Information

— Information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets by geographic
area is set forth in note 8 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” Risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this Form 10-K under the heading “Certain Risks and Uncertainties” and “Item
1A. Risk Factors”.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS

We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and
manage exposure to these market risks as follows:

(1)

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates – Foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Our primary exchange
rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar against the United States dollar. Our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at December 31, 2009.

(2)

Commodity Steel Pricing – We buy and sell various types of steel products; these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners. During the
last decade, there has been nominal movement in overall steel pricing, with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the Far East markets that occurred in the late 1990’s. This trend reversed to inflation in the period
from late 2003 to the early part of 2005 and again from mid 2007 to the fall of 2008. Since the fall of 2008, there has been nominal inflation switching to deflation. We are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability
to pass through the impacts to our end customers.

(3)

Commodity Fuel Prices – We have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel; however, this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs
to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Fastenal Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fastenal Company and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2009. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business
Overview

Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We operate stores
primarily located in North America. On December 31, 2009, we operated 2,369 company owned or leased store locations.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fastenal Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as ‘Fastenal’ or by such terms as ‘we’, ‘our’, or ‘us.’). All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable

Net sales include products, services, and freight and handling costs billed, net of any related sales incentives paid to customers and net of an estimate for product returns. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, title and risk of ownership have passed, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. These criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to, or picked up by, the customer. We recognize billings for freight
and handling charges at the time the products are shipped to, or picked up by, the customer. We recognize services at the time the service is provided to the customer. We estimate product returns based on historical return rates. Accounts receivable
are stated at their estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted
to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The functional currency of our
foreign operations is the applicable local currency. The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts (with the exception of retained earnings) using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date, for retained
earnings at historical exchange rates, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the year. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, captioned accumulated
other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in operating and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents are held primarily at two banks. For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider all highly-liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued

Financial Instruments and Marketable Securities

All financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate estimated fair value. The fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a
current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. Assets measured at fair value are categorized based upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument, Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based upon our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. In determining fair value we use observable market data when
available.

Marketable securities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 consist of debt securities. We classify our debt securities as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value based on current market value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings but are included in comprehensive income and
are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity until realized, unless a decline in the market value of any available-for-sale security below cost is deemed other than temporary and is charged to earnings, resulting in the
establishment of a new cost basis for the security.

Inventories

Inventories, consisting of finished goods merchandise held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or market.

Property and Equipment

Property and
equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on buildings and equipment is provided for using the straight-line method over the anticipated economic useful lives of the related property. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value
exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market value, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. There were no impairments recorded
during 2009, 2008, or 2007.

Leases

We lease space under operating leases for our Utah, Washington, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, and Alberta, Canada; distribution centers, our Connecticut manufacturing facility (since December 19, 2009), and
certain store locations with initial terms of one to 60 months. Most store locations have initial lease terms of 36 to 48 months. These leases do not have significant rent escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other
build-out clauses. Any such terms are recognized as rent expense over the term of the lease. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. Leasehold improvements on operating leases are amortized over a 36-month period. We lease
certain semi-tractors and pick-ups under operating leases. The semi-tractor leases typically have a 36-month term. The pick-up leases typically have a non-cancellable lease term of one year, with renewal options for up to 72-months.



Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued

Other Assets and Long-Lived Assets

Other assets consist of prepaid security deposits, goodwill, and a non-compete agreement. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired. Net goodwill was $1,400 in all three years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually. The non-compete is amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Net non-compete asset was $223 and $290 at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. Total non-compete amortization costs were $67 per year in all three years.

Goodwill and other tangible and
identifiable intangible long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, or on an annual basis if no event or change occurs, to determine that the
unamortized balances are recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and, in the case of goodwill, by also looking at an adverse change in
legal factors or the business climate, a transition to a new product or services strategy, a significant change in the customer base, and/or a realization of failed marketing efforts. If the asset is deemed to be impaired, the amount of impairment
is charged to earnings as a part of operating and administrative expenses in the current period. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Accounting Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Insurance Reserves

We are self-insured for certain losses relating to medical,
dental, workers’ compensation, and other casualty losses. Specific stop loss coverage is provided for catastrophic claims in order to limit exposure to significant claims. Losses and claims are charged to operations when it is probable a loss
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Accrued insurance liabilities are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported.

Product Warranties

We offer a basic limited warranty for certain of our products.
The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold. We typically recoup these costs through product warranties we hold with the original equipment manufacturers. Our warranty expense has historically been
minimal.

Stockholders’ Equity and Stock-Based Compensation

We have one stock option employee compensation plan (Fastenal Option Plan). The Fastenal Option Plan was approved by our shareholders in April 2003 and amended by our shareholders in April 2007.

The options granted vest and become exercisable over a period of up to eight years. Each option will terminate, to the extent not previously
exercised, 13 months after the end of the relevant vesting period. Approximately 210,000 of the options under our 2007 grant were vested as of December 31, 2009. Compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value is recognized for these
awards over the vesting period.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.



We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being
sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Comprehensive Income

We comply with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 220,

Comprehensive Income

, which establishes standards for the reporting of
comprehensive income and its components. The components of comprehensive income are as follows:

Earnings Per Share

Basic net earnings per share is calculated using net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net
earnings per share is similar to basic net earnings per share except that the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding includes the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon the exercise of stock options considered to be
“in-the-money”. The following table presents a reconciliation of the denominators used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share related to the Fastenal Option Plan:

Segment Reporting

We have determined that we meet the aggregation criteria outlined in the accounting standards as our various operations have similar (1) economic characteristics, (2) products and services,
(3) customers, (4) distribution channels, and (5) regulatory environments. Therefore we report as a single business segment.

Acquisitions

On December 18, 2009, we purchased certain assets of Holo-Krome, a domestic manufacturer of socket
products (a type of fastener). We paid $5,032 in cash to acquire the inventory and fixed assets of Holo-Krome.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts from prior years’ financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Note 2. Financial Instruments and Marketable Securities

On January 1, 2008, we adopted the fair value guidance for financial assets and liabilities. The adoption had no impact on our results of operations and
financial condition. As of December 31, 2009, our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are debt securities. The government and agency securities have a maturity of 12 months and are valued using Level 1
inputs. The state and municipal bonds have maturities ranging from 1 to 24 years and are valued using Level 2 inputs. The debt securities are classified as marketable securities in current assets and non-current assets, respectively, on the
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The debt securities in current assets have a fair value of $24,400, and the debt securities in non-current assets have a fair value of $6,253 with immaterial unrealized gains or
losses. The unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the realized gains and losses recorded in earnings were immaterial during 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Marketable securities, all treated as available-for-sale securities at December 31, consist of the following:

Maturities of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2009 consist of the following:

Note 3. Property and Equipment

Property and equipment as of December 31 consists of the following:

Note 4. Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses as of December 31 consist of the following:

Note 5. Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred stock has a par value of $.01 per share. There were 5,000,000 shares authorized and no shares issued as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Common
stock has a par value of $.01 per share. There were 200,000,000 shares authorized and 147,430,712 shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 200,000,000 shares authorized and 148,530,712 shares issued and outstanding as of
December 31, 2008.

Dividends

On January 18, 2010, our board of directors declared a semi-annual dividend of $.40 per share of common stock to be paid in cash on February 26, 2010 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2010.

Stock Options

During the last three years, we granted, effective at the close of business on the date of grant, options to purchase shares of our stock as follows:

All of the options in the table above vest and become exercisable over a period of up to eight years.
Each option will terminate, to the extent not previously exercised, 13 months after the end of the relevant vesting period. Approximately 210,000 options under our 2007 grant were vested as of December 31, 2009. Compensation expense equal to
the grant date fair value is recognized for these awards over the vesting period.

The fair value of each share-based option is estimated on
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation method that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. The expected life is the most significant assumption as it determines the period for which the risk-free interest rate, volatility, and
dividend yield must be applied. The expected life is the average length of time over which the employee groups will exercise their options, which is based on historical experience with similar grants. Expected volatilities are based on the movement
of our stock over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life at the time of grant. The dividend yield is estimated over the
expected life based on our current dividend payout, historical dividends paid, and expected future cash dividends. The following table illustrates the assumptions for the options granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

A summary of activity under the Fastenal Option Plan previously described is presented below:


Weighted-average
exercise price


Weighted-average remaining contractual life in years

Total stock-based compensation expense for the Fastenal Option Plan was $3,850, $3,247, and $1,915 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, there was no intrinsic value for the options outstanding as the closing stock price at year-end was less
than the option exercise price. Unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $17,702, $20,033, and $21,729, and is expected to be recognized over the weighted average
periods noted in the table above and will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated forefeitures.

Note 6. Retirement Savings Plan

The Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) Plan covers all of our employees in the United States. Our employees in Canada may
participate in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan. The general purpose of both of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings. We contributed $0, $5,207
and $4,743 to our employees’ retirement accounts for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of
December 31 are as follows:

No valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.
The character of the deferred tax assets is such that they can be realized through carryback to prior tax periods or offset against future taxable income.

We adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,

Income Taxes

on January 1, 2007. Implementation of ASC 740 resulted in no adjustment to the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is an immaterial amount for interest and
penalties, both of which we classify as a component of income tax expense.

Fastenal Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax
returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction, all states, and various foreign jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for taxable years before, in the case of United States
Federal and non-United States examinations, 2006 and, in the case of state and local examinations, 2003.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized, is not material.

Note 8. Geographic Information

Our revenues and long-lived assets (except marketable securities) relate to the following geographic areas:

Accounting policies of the operations in the various geographic areas are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, location security deposits, goodwill, and other intangibles. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the store from which
the sale occurred. No single customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.

Note 9. Operating Leases

We lease space under non-cancelable operating leases for our Utah, Washington, Alberta, Canada, and Nuevo Leon, Mexico distribution centers, for our
Connecticut manufacturing facility (since December 19, 2009), and certain store locations with initial terms of one to 60 months. Most store locations have initial lease terms of 36 to 48 months. These leases do not have significant rent
escalation holidays, concessions, leasehold improvement incentives, or other build-out clauses. Any such terms are recognized as rent expense over the term of the lease. Further, the leases do not contain contingent rent provisions. Leasehold
improvements, with a net book value of $1,847 at December 31, 2009, on operating leases are amortized over a 36-month period. We lease certain semi-tractors and pick-ups under operating leases. The semi-tractor leases typically have a 36-month
term. The pick-up leases typically have a non-cancellable lease term of approximately one year, with renewal options for up to 72-months. Our average lease term is typically for 28-36 months. Future minimum annual rentals for the leased facilities
and the leased vehicles are as follows:

Certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions which would become
due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value. The aggregate residual value at lease expiration, of the leases that contain residual value guarantees, is
approximately $14,603. We believe the likelihood of funding the guarantee obligation under any provision of the operating lease agreements is remote, except for a $1,982 loss on disposal reserve provided at December 31, 2009.

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Facilities

We have a line of credit arrangement with a bank which expires June 20, 2010. The line allows for
borrowings of up to $8,000 at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. On December 31, 2009 there was $0 outstanding on the line. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.

We maintain certain marketable securities as collateral on behalf of our insurance carrier. As of December 31, 2009, the total balance of these government and agency securities is $24,400. The
classification and valuation of these securities are discussed in “Note 2. Financial Instruments and Marketable Securities”.

During
2001, we completed the construction of a new building for our Kansas City warehouse, and completed an expansion of this warehouse in 2004. We were required to obtain financing for the construction and expansion of this facility under an Industrial
Revenue Bond (IRB). We subsequently purchased 100% of the outstanding bonds under the IRB at par. In addition to purchasing the outstanding obligations, we have a right of offset included in the IRB debt agreement. Accordingly, we have netted the
impact of the IRB in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The outstanding balance of the IRB was $9,733 at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in certain legal actions. The outcomes
of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost
revenues. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-10-05,

Contingencies

, we record a liability in the consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered
probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is
reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Negative
outcomes for our litigation matters are not considered probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.

On October 18, 2007, a
complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Fastenal on behalf of two former employees claiming to represent all employees employed in the store position of Assistant General Manager in the
United States within three years prior to the filing date (four years for California employees). The suit alleged Fastenal misclassified its Assistant General Managers as exempt for purposes of the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act
and California and Pennsylvania state statutes. This suit also alleged that Assistant General Managers in California did not receive sufficient meal breaks and paid rest periods under the California Labor Code. An opt-in class was certified for this
action.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Continued

On August 29, 2008, we issued a press release announcing a preliminary agreement to settle the
class action lawsuit noted above. While we deny the allegations underlying the lawsuit, we agreed to enter into the settlement agreement in order to avoid significant legal fees, the uncertainty of a jury trial, distractions to our operations, and
other expenses and management time that would have to be devoted to protracted litigation. The settlement, which received court approval, fully resolved all claims brought by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit. Pursuant to the settlement, we made a cash
payment of $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to cover claims by eligible class members, plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs, and payments to the named plaintiffs. The expense for this settlement was recorded in the third quarter of
2008. We do not expect the settlement to have any material impact on our operating results going forward.

In early February 2010, we received
a letter from a fastener supplier dated January 26, 2010. This letter threatened to sue us for our alleged violation of an exclusive distribution arrangement this supplier believes exists between our organizations. In addition, this supplier
provided a press release and a video regarding the claim that they threatened to make public unless we agreed to mediation of the claim. We have performed a preliminary internal review during the last several days to understand (1) who this supplier
is and (2) the nature of our relationship with this supplier. While we have had only a limited time to investigate this matter, we have determined that this supplier manufacturers a niche type of fastener and that the total volume of purchases by
us, from all suppliers, over the purported term of this alleged exclusivity arrangement of this niche type of fastener does not exceed $1 million. Based on our preliminary inquiry, we believe it is remote that this claim would have a material
adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. While we are not required to disclose this matter under the rules of the SEC, we believe that disclosure is prudent due to the alleged amount of the claim and the threat
to make these allegations public.

Note 11. Sales by Product Line

The percentages of our net sales by product line are as follows:


Fastener product line represents fasteners and miscellaneous supplies.


Direct ship represents a cross section of products from the ten product lines. The items included here represent certain items with historically low
margins which are shipped directly from our distribution channel to our customers, bypassing our store network.

Note 12.
Subsequent Events

The company evaluated all subsequent event activity through February 9, 2010 (the issue date of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K) and concluded that no subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.



Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The attestation report required under this item is contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K on page 34.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a15-(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. There was no change in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
