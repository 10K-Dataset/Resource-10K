PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Fastenal Company
(“Fastenal Company” and, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, Fastenal Company Services, Fastenal Company Purchasing, Fastenal Company Leasing, Fastenal Canada Company, Fastenal Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V., Fastenal Mexico Services,
S. de R.L. de C.V., and Fastenal Singapore P.T.E. Ltd., collectively, “the Company”) began as a partnership in 1967, and was incorporated under the laws of Minnesota in 1968. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had 1,169 store sites
located in 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Singapore and 4,743 people employed at these sites.

The Company sells industrial and construction supplies in a wholesale and retail fashion. As of December 31, 2002 these industrial and construction supplies were grouped into ten product lines
described further below.


The Company operated eleven
distribution centers as of December 31, 2002 from which the Company distributes products to its store sites, and operates a facility in Memphis, Tennessee to receive and distribute products coming from suppliers involved in the Company’s
‘Customer Service Project’ (CSP).

Development of
the Business

Fastenal Company began in 1967 with a marketing
strategy of supplying threaded fasteners to customers in small, medium-sized, and, in subsequent years, large cities. The Company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer its customers a full line of products at convenient
locations and to the high quality of the Company’s employees.

The Company opened its first store site in Winona, Minnesota, a city with a population of approximately 25,000. The following table shows the number of Company store sites at the end of each of the last ten years and the related
consolidated net sales for each year during the last ten years:

As of December 31, 2002,
the Company operated 1,169 store sites located in:

United States

1,088

Mexico


Puerto Rico


Singapore


Canada


The Company has closed
only four stores in its history.

The Company selects new
locations for its stores based on their proximity to the Company’s distribution network, population statistics, and employment data for manufacturing and construction. The Company intends to continue opening new store sites and currently
expects the rate of new store openings to be approximately 14 to 16% per year.

The Company stocks all new stores with an inventory drawn from all of its product lines. Subsequent to a site’s opening, the site personnel may customize the inventory offering to that site’s customer base.

For several years, the Company had two types of stores: (1) the stand-alone
store and (2) the satellite store. The stand-alone store was typically located in cities with a population in excess of 8,000. The second type, the satellite store, operated as a satellite of a stand-alone store. The satellite store was usually
located within 30 miles of the stand-alone (mother) store and was typically managed by personnel at the mother store. The Company had satellite stores located in communities with a population as small as 2,000. The Company discontinued this
distinction at the end of 2002. Of the 144 stores opened during 2002, none opened as a satellite store. The Company believes, based on the demographics of the marketplace in the United States and Canada, that there is sufficient potential in those
two countries to support approximately 2,000 to 2,200 total stores. Many of the new store sites would be in cities in which we currently operate.

In addition to the stores discussed above, the Company also operates “in-plant” sites. The “in-plant” site is a selling unit located
in or near a customer’s facility. These sites are not included in the store count numbers as they represent a customer subset of a store.


The Company opened the
following store sites, outside the United States, in the last five years:

During 2002, the Company
began operating an “in-plant” site in the Dominican Republic. The Company plans to open additional store sites in Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and Singapore in the future. The store sites located outside the United States contributed less
than 5% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2002. In all years presented, the Company also sold products into Mexico from its existing stores along the border between the United States and Mexico.

No assurance can be given that any of the expansion plans described above will
be achieved, or that new stores, once opened, will be profitable.

It has been the Company’s experience that near-term profitability has been adversely affected by the opening of new store sites, due to the related start-up costs and the time necessary to generate a customer base. A new store
generates its sales from direct sales calls, a slow process involving repeated contacts. As a result of this process, sales volume builds slowly and it typically requires nine to 12 months for a new store to achieve its first profitable month. Of
the 24 stores opened in the first quarter of 2002, 10 were profitable in the fourth quarter of 2002.

For 2002, annual sales volumes of store sites operating at least five years ranged between approximately $175 and $7,061, with 75% of these store sites having annual sales volumes within the range of
approximately $417 to $1,640. The data in the following table shows the growth in the average sales of the Company’s store sites from 2001 to 2002 based on each site’s age (dollar amounts in thousands). The store sites opened in 2002
contributed approximately $18.6 (or approximately 2.1%) of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2002, with the remainder coming from store sites opened prior to 2002 and from the acquisition of the DIY Business discussed below.


The average sales include sales of store sites open for less than the full fiscal year.


As of December 31, 2002, the
Company operated distribution centers in or near Winona, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Dallas, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Fresno, California; Seattle, Washington; Akron, Ohio; Salt Lake City, Utah; Winston-Salem, North
Carolina; and Kansas City, Missouri. Distribution centers are located so as to permit twice-a-week to five times-a-week deliveries to Company stores using Company trucks and overnight delivery by surface common carrier. As the number of stores
increases, the Company intends to add new distribution centers. The Company also operates a centralized distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. This facility consolidates inventory for the ‘Customer Service Project’ (CSP) and ships it
to existing stores, for use in conversion to the CSP format, and also to new stores.

On August 31, 2001, the Company acquired certain assets of two subsidiaries of Textron, Inc. These assets were used in their business of selling packaged fasteners to the retail market (Do-It-Yourself or DIY Business). The
DIY Business was purchased after a prolonged period of contraction; therefore, the historical sales and earnings were not reflective of the DIY Business’s operations at the time it was acquired by the Company. The DIY Business was subsequently
sold to The Hillman Group, Inc. on October 3, 2002. The DIY Business produced net sales of $16,974 and $8,526 during the approximately nine months and four months, respectively, that it was operated by the Company in 2002 and 2001. The DIY Business
had facilities in Rockford, Illinois and Goodlettsville, Tennessee (near Nashville).

The Company operates a central UNIX/terminal-based computer system allowing automatic data exchange between the stores and the distribution centers. The use of client/server technology allows the Company’s network of
UNIX-based machines to serve networked personal computers and workstations. During the last four years, the Company has been converting a portion of this central processing system to a new computer software and operating system and plans to convert
additional modules during 2003. At the store level, the Company operates a proprietary point-of-sale system. This system operates on a Microsoft Windows NT system.

Trademarks

The Company conducts its business in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Singapore under various trademarks and service marks, including
Fastenal

®

, FastTool

®

, SharpCut

®

, EquipRite

®

, CleanChoice

®

, PowerPhase

™

, and FastArc

™

. During 2002 and 2001, the Company also operated the DIY Business under the trademarks FAS-N-IT

™

, and Anchor Wire

™

. The Anchor Wire

™

trademark was sold with the sale of the DIY Business in October 2002.
Although the Company does not believe its operations are substantially dependent upon any of its trademarks or service marks, the Company considers its “Fastenal” name and other trademarks and service marks to be valuable to its business.


Products

The Company’s original product offering in 1967 was fasteners and other industrial and construction supplies, many of which are sold under the Fastenal

®

product name. Today, the fastener product line consists of approximately 169,000 different stock items. This product line consists of two broad
categories: threaded fasteners, such as bolts, nuts, screws, studs, and related washers; and miscellaneous supplies, such as paints, various pins and machinery keys, concrete anchors, batteries, sealants, metal framing systems, wire rope, strut,
private label stud anchors, rivets, and related accessories.

Threaded fasteners are used in most manufactured products and building projects, and in the maintenance and repair of machines and structures. Many aspects of the threaded fastener market are common to all cities; variations from
city to city that do exist typically relate to the types of businesses operating in a market or to the environmental conditions in a market. Therefore, the Company opens each store with a broad selection of base stocks of inventory and then allows
the local store and district leaders to tailor the additional inventory to the local market demand as it develops. Threaded fasteners accounted for approximately 46%, 49%, and 51% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Concrete anchors make up the largest
portion of the other supply items included in the Fastenal

®

product line. Most concrete anchors use threaded
fasteners as part of the completed anchor assembly.

During the
last ten years, the Company added additional product lines. The product lines introduced during the 1990’s are sold through the same distribution channel as the original Fastenal

®

product line. The additional product lines include the following:


During 2002 and 2001, the Company sold product in an eleventh product line called ‘Retail packaged product’. This product line was added with the 2001
acquisition of the DIY Business. The DIY Business was sold in 2002. This product line is now included in the other product lines and represents a subset of the type of products included in our CSP conversion.


Excluding gas and welding machines.

The Company plans to add other product lines in the future.


Inventory Control

The Company controls inventory by using computer systems, sales personnel, product managers, and vendor information to determine desired stock levels. The data used for this determination is derived from sales activity from all of
Company’s stores, from individual stores, and from geographic areas; it is also derived from vendor information and from customer demographic information. The computer system monitors the inventory level for all stock items and triggers
replenishment, or prompts a buyer, as necessary based on an established minimum-maximum level. All stores stock a base inventory and may expand beyond preset inventory levels as deemed appropriate by their district managers. Inventories in
distribution centers are established from computerized data for the stores served by the respective centers.

Manufacturing and Support Services Operations

In 2002 approximately 95.7% of the Company’s consolidated net sales were attributable to products manufactured by other companies to industry standards. The remaining amount of approximately 4.3%
of the Company’s consolidated net sales for 2002 related to products manufactured, modified or repaired by either the Company’s Manufacturing Division or its Support Services. The manufactured products consist primarily of non-standard
sizes of threaded fasteners made to customers’ specifications. The services provided by the Support Services group include, but are not limited to, items such as tool repair, band saw blade welding, third-party logistics, and light
manufacturing. The Company engages in these activities primarily as a service to its customers and expects these activities in the future to continue to contribute in the range of 4% to 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Sources of Supply

The Company uses a large number of suppliers for the approximately 356,000
standard stock items it distributes. Most items distributed by the Company can be purchased from several sources, although preferred sourcing is used for some stock items to facilitate quality control. No single supplier accounted for more than 5.0%
of the Company’s purchases in 2002.


Customers and Marketing

The Company believes its success can be attributed to its ability to offer customers in small, medium, and large-sized cities a full line of products at convenient locations, and to the high quality of the Company’s employees.
Most of the Company’s customers are in the construction and manufacturing markets. The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment
manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations. Other users of the Company’s products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, municipalities, schools, and certain retail trades. As of December 31, 2002, the Company’s
total number of active customer accounts (defined as accounts having purchase activity within the last 90 days) was approximately 159,000.

During each of the three years ended December 31, 2002, no one customer accounted for a significant portion of the Company’s sales. The Company
believes that the large number of its customers together with the varied markets that they represent provide some protection to the Company from economic downturns in a particular market.

Store personnel generate a significant portion of the Company’s sales through direct calls on customers. Because of the
nature of the Company’s business, the Company does not use the more expensive forms of mass media advertising such as television, radio, and newspapers. Forms of advertising used by the Company include signs, catalogs, and direct mailings.

Competition

The Company’s business is highly competitive. Competitors include both
large distributors located primarily in large cities and smaller distributors located in many of the same cities in which the Company has stores. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for the
Company’s products are customer service and convenience.

Some competitors use vans to sell their products in markets away from their main warehouses, while others rely on mail order or telemarketing sales. The Company, however, believes that the convenience provided to customers by
operating stores in small, medium, and large markets, each offering a wide variety of products, is a competitive selling advantage and that the large number of stores in a given area, taken together with the Company’s ability to provide
frequent deliveries to such stores from centrally located distribution centers, makes possible the prompt and efficient distribution of products. Having trained personnel at each store also enhances the Company’s ability to compete (see
“Employees” below).

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, the Company employed a total of 7,108 full and
part-time employees, 4,743 being store managers and store employees, and the balance being employed in the Company’s distribution centers, manufacturing operations, service operations, and home office.

The Company believes that the quality of its employees is critical to its
ability to compete successfully in the markets it currently serves and to its ability to open new stores in new markets. The Company fosters the growth and education of skilled employees throughout the organization by operating training programs and
by decentralizing decision-making. Wherever possible, promotions are from within the Company. For example, most new store managers are promoted from an assistant manager’s position at another store and district managers (who supervise a number
of stores) are usually former store managers.


The Company’s sales
personnel participate in incentive bonus arrangements that place emphasis on achieving increased sales on a store and regional basis, while still attaining targeted levels of gross profit and collections. As a result, a significant portion of the
Company’s total employment cost varies with sales volume. The Company also pays incentive bonuses to other personnel for achieving pre-determined cost containment goals.

None of the Company’s employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and the Company has experienced no work
stoppages. The Company believes its employee relations are excellent.

Posting of Periodic and Current Reports

Fastenal Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, are available free of charge on or through the Company’s website at

www.fastenal.com

as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

The Company owns six facilities in Winona, Minnesota. These facilities are as
follows:

The Company also owns
the following facilities, excluding store locations, outside of Winona, Minnesota:


New buildings added in 2002, scheduled to become operational in 2003.



In addition, the Company owns 70 buildings that house the
Company’s store locations in various cities throughout North America and is currently in the process of building or renovating another 23 owned store locations.

All other buildings occupied by the Company are leased. Leased stores range from approximately 1,200 to 8,000 square feet,
with lease terms of up to 48 months. The Company also leases the following distribution centers:


The lease renewal can be exercised at the Company’s option.

If economic conditions are suitable, the Company
will, in the future, consider purchasing store sites to house its older stores. It is anticipated that all sites for new stores will continue to be leased. It is the Company’s policy to negotiate relatively short lease terms to facilitate
relocation of particular store operations if deemed desirable by management. It has been the Company’s experience that space suitable for its needs and available for leasing is more than sufficient.
