The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in Part II of this report under the caption “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Segment Information

We manage our restaurant brands in North America as operating segments. The brands operate principally in the U.S. within full-service dining.  We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates.  We have four reportable segments: 1) Olive Garden, 2) LongHorn Steakhouse, 3) Fine Dining (which includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V’s) and 4) Other Business (which includes Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, consumer-packaged goods and franchise revenues). External sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales, we do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales and the customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments.  Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).

The final column in the table lists our total sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years indicated.

(2)

Includes company-owned synergy restaurants as follows: one in fiscal 2011, one in fiscal 2012, four in fiscal 2013, and four in fiscal 2014.  We converted the four synergy restaurants to Olive Garden restaurants in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

Strategy

We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s full-service segment. Generally, the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual, and full service. All of our restaurants fall within the full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains.  We believe we have strong brands, and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things.

During fiscal 2017, our operating philosophy remained focused on improving the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation, attentive service, engaging atmosphere, and integrated marketing. Darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale, insight, and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages. Additionally, brands can capitalize on insights to deliver customized one-to-one customer relationship marketing. We hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders.


Recent and Planned Restaurant Growth

During fiscal


, we added


net new company-owned restaurants in the United States, including the Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen company-owned restaurants acquired in April 2017. Our fiscal


actual restaurant openings and closings, fiscal


projected openings, and approximate capital investment, square footage and dining capacity, by brand, are shown below.

(1)

Includes the 140 Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen acquired restaurants.

(2)

Includes cash investments for building, equipment, furniture and other construction costs; excludes internal capitalized overhead, pre-opening expenses, tenant allowance and future lease obligations. Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen capital investments are based on costs associated with land-only leases; The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s and Yard House capital investments are based on ground and building leases.  Actual costs can vary significantly depending on the specific location.

(3)

Includes all space under the roof, including the coolers and freezers.

(4)

Includes bar dining seats and patio seating, but excludes bar stools.

The actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal


will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits, complete construction, and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel.  Our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands.

We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process.  Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the site’s visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities.  Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition.  Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired.

We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards.  When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance.  If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands. Permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site concerns.  Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges.

Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen Integration

We acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen on April 24, 2017, approximately five weeks before the end of our fiscal year.  We plan to integrate many of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen’s operations into the Darden operational model during the 2018 fiscal year.  The descriptions of our restaurant operations below do not include Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen unless specifically mentioned.


Restaurant Operations

We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success.  Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size.  We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.

Each Olive Garden restaurant is led by a general manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner.  Each also has three to five additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant.  In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 80 to 120 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time.  Restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately seven to ten restaurants.   Each director of operations of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse reports to a Senior Vice President of Operations who is responsible for up to one hundred restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.

Each Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurant is led by a general manager or managing partner.  Each also has two to six managers and one to two culinary managers.  In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time.  The general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to an area director, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants.  Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.

Each Bahama Breeze and Yard House restaurant is led by a general manager, and each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s restaurant is led by a managing partner.  Each also has two to eight managers.  Each The Capital Grille, Yard House, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s restaurant has one to three executive chefs, and one to two sous chefs, and each Bahama Breeze restaurant has one to three culinary managers.  In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time.  The general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants.  Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.

Our Learning and Employee Development team in partnership with each brand’s training leader, together with senior operations executives, is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include a 10 to 12-week training program for management trainees (seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions) and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations.  The opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening.  They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff.

We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level team members. We believe that our leadership position, strong results-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock-based compensation, enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.

Quality Assurance

Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment.  Through rigorous supplier and risk based product evaluations, we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications.  We rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors.  Suppliers that produce “high-risk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually.  We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs and risk based preventative controls adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  These programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met.  We require routine food safety verification for high risk products from our suppliers.  Our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation.  The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety.


Purchasing and Distribution

Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe, high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement.  Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1,500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries.  Suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products.  Competitive bids, long-term contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products.

We believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability.  Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source top-quality food products at competitive prices.  We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen).  We actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that Darden incorporates women- and minority-owned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions.

We continue to drive automation of our supply chain by working with our suppliers, logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility.  Through our subsidiary, Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. (Darden Direct), and long-term agreements with our third party national distribution companies, we maintain inventory ownership of food and supplies in warehouses primarily dedicated to Darden where practical to do so.  Darden Direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into long-term agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with suppliers.  Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales.

Advertising and Marketing

Integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy, and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry.  Olive Garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising.  Olive Garden supplements this with cable, local television and digital advertising.  LongHorn Steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market.  Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s do not use television advertising, but rely on local and digital marketing.  Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands.  We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits, as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests.  We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook® and Instagram®, as appropriate, to attract, engage and retain our guests.  We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and expectations.

In fiscal 2017, we continued a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society.  We also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse.  In addition, we continued to further improve brand loyalty and customer relationship management programs for our brands to increase the frequency of visits and offer our guests flexibility when making dining decisions. As we implement new platforms, we are integrating them into all guest touch points including restaurant operating systems to enable compelling personalized guest experiences.

In fiscal 2017, Olive Garden continued to leverage Spanish language advertising to increase awareness and visits from Hispanic consumers.

Employees

At the end of fiscal


, we employed over 175,000 people (team members) in the United States and Canada, including at Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.  Of these team members, approximately 165,000 were hourly restaurant personnel. The remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field, or were located at one of our restaurant support center facilities in Orlando, Florida, Irvine, California or Irving, Texas.  Our executives have an average of 15 years of experience with us.  The restaurant general managers and managing partners average 12 years with us.  We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most team members, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis.  None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Consistent with one of our core values of diversity, we are committed to attracting, retaining, engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests.  Approximately 50 percent of our restaurant team member employees are minorities and over 53 percent are female.  According to the People Report’s Human Capital Intelligence Report for April 2017,


the diversity of our operations leadership teams exceeds industry averages by nearly 1 percentage point for minority and 9 percentage points for female representation.  At the vice president level and above, 21 percent of our leaders are minorities and 29 percent are female.  The percentages of minority and female leaders at the vice president and above level rank above average in our industry.  In addition, we achieved a 100 percent score on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index for our business practices and policies toward our lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender team members.

Consistent with our core values of respect and caring and teamwork, in fiscal 1999, we established a program called Darden Dimes to help fellow Darden team members in need.

Darden Dimes provides short-term financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters. Participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the Darden Dimes fund, which raises and grants more than $1.5 million annually.

Information Technology

We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy.  We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control, cost management, guest service and employee effectiveness.  These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand.  Our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence.

Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida.  A high-speed data network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location.  Our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently.  Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets.  We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup.  We use internally developed proprietary software, as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.

Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning.  Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.

Competition

The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, availability of carryout and home delivery, internet and mobile ordering capabilites and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power.  We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section.  In addition, improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants and expansion of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives.  We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.

Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “Purchasing and Distribution,” “Advertising and Marketing” and “Information Technology” in this Item 1 and in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts.  Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them.  Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.


Franchises, Joint Ventures and New Business Development

As of

May 28, 2017

, we operated

1,695

restaurants through subsidiaries in the United States and Canada. We own all of those locations, except for


restaurants managed by us and owned by joint ventures.  The joint ventures pay management fees to us, and we control the joint ventures’ use of our service marks.  Franchisees or licensees operated


franchised restaurants in the United States and Canada.

Our restaurant operations outside of the United States and Canada are conducted through area development and franchise agreements.  We have area development and/or franchise agreements in place with unaffiliated operators to develop and operate Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in:

•

Middle East (Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates),

•

Mexico,

•

Central and South America (Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama), and

•

Malaysia.

As of

May 28, 2017

, franchisees operated


franchised restaurants located throughout these regions.  The restaurant developments under the area development agreements are in various states of progress, and the open and operating restaurants are all reflected in the table under the “Introduction” section of this Item 1.  We do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees, but we receive license fees under the area development and franchise agreements and royalty income under the franchise agreements.  The amount of income we derive from our joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

We license the sales and distribution of several items including Olive Garden salad dressings, salad croutons, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, LongHorn Steakhouse seasoning and Olive Garden seasoning through various channels including wholesale distribution chains and major grocery chains.  The amount of income we derive from these licensing arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Seasonality

Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.  Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall.  Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.  Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

Government Regulation

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business.  Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located.  The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations.  To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

During fiscal


,

12.6 percent

of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time.  These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.  The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations.  We also are subject in certain states to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party.  We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.

We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices.  Changes in these laws during fiscal 2017 have not had a material effect on our operations.

We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  Through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported cash tips.


We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal


, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.

Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes.  Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.

We continue to monitor the status of the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 (Affordable Care Act) and related rules and regulations.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling.  We are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content.  Provisions in the Affordable Care Act require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request; however, regulations implementing those statutory provisions have been delayed until May 2018.

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud.  An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information.

See Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, data privacy and environmental matters.

Sustainability

Darden’s commitment to sustainability is embedded as a key component of providing great service and food to our guests.  It is an element that separates us from our competitors, and a contributor to our business success.  Our approach is both integrated and strategic and spans the enterprise from the commodities we source to the operation of our restaurants.  Conservation is a competitive advantage - it continues to lower our operating costs over time, insulate our supply chain, and help us attract and retain the most qualified employees - all increasing the success of our business.

More information about our sustainability strategy, our commitment to our guests on Food Principles and our progress to date is available at our website: www.darden.com/sustainability.

Darden Foundation and Community Affairs

We are recognized for a culture that rewards caring for and responding to people.  That defines service for Darden.  The Darden Restaurants, Inc. Foundation (Foundation) works to bring to life this spirit of service through its philanthropic support of charitable organizations across the country as well as the volunteer involvement of our team members.  The Foundation does this by focusing its philanthropic efforts on programs that enhance the communities in which our team members and guests live and work.

In fiscal 2017, we awarded approximately $3.8 million in grants through the Foundation.  We awarded grants to national organizations such as the American Red Cross, Feeding America, and the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation, as well as local nonprofits including Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida and the Heart of Florida United Way.  These organizations provide service to the public through disaster preparedness, hunger relief, community engagement, and the promotion of career opportunities in the culinary industry.

In 2003, we began the Darden Harvest program as a mechanism for getting fresh and healthy food to people who need it.  Each day across most of our restaurants, we collect surplus, wholesome food that is not served to guests and, rather than discarding the food, we prepare it for donation to local nonprofit feeding partners.  In fiscal 2017, Darden contributed over 7 million pounds of food which is enough to feed more than 1,300 families of four, three meals a day for an entire year.   In April 2017, the Darden Harvest program achieved a significant milestone when it reached a total of 100 million pounds of food donated over the life of program. That’s the equivalent of approximately 83 million meals provided to people in need across the communities served by Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and Eddie V’s.  As an added benefit of the Darden Harvest program, we are able to divert millions of pounds of surplus food from waste streams every year, making the Darden Harvest program a key part of our goal to one day send zero waste to landfills.


More information about the Foundation and its efforts to enhance the quality of life in the communities where we do business is available on our website at www.darden.com.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business.  Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.


The inability to successfully integrate Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen into our business could harm our ability to achieve the cost savings and other benefits we expect to be able to realize in the Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen operations.

On April 24, 2017, we acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen. Our integration of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen’s business into our operations is a complex and time-consuming process that may not be successful. The primary areas of focus for successfully combining the business of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen with our operations may include, among others: retaining and integrating management and other key employees; integrating information, communications and other systems; and managing the growth of the combined company.

Even if we successfully integrate the business of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen into our operations, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits. We acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits for the combined company including, among others, business and growth opportunities and significant synergies from increased efficiency in purchasing, distribution and other restaurant and corporate support. Increased competition and/or deterioration in business conditions may limit our ability to expand this business. As such, we may not be able to realize the synergies, goodwill, business opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition.

We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network, free from material failure, interruption or security breach could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and/or result in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees.

We rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including for marketing programs, employee engagement, management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing system in our restaurants, and various other processes and transactions.  Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems.  In addition, we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments. Disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these guest facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and negatively affect our relationship with our guests.  The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a material network breach in the security of these systems as a result of a cyber attack, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or an individual.  This could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, or the improper use of personal information or other “identity theft.”  Each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in guest service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, result in customer or advertiser dissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and we could be subjected to litigation, regulatory investigations or the imposition of penalties.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change and cyber risks evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance and protect guest, employee and Company information.

A failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.

Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products.  Even with strong preventative interventions and controls, food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control and require prompt action to mitigate impact.  In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A, norovirus or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.

Litigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; guest discrimination; food safety issues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; violation of “dram shop” laws (providing an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party); trademark infringement; violation of the federal securities laws; or other concerns.  The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify.  Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of


very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable. Litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well.  Allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention.  As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Unfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales.

The good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business.  Actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands.  Even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and, indirectly, our own brands.  Negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, employee dissatisfaction, guest discrimination, illness, injury, or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation.  Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants, or only to a single restaurant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand.  Negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products, environmental disasters, crime incidents, data privacy breaches, scandals involving our employees, or operational problems at our restaurants, all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our guests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales.  Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, environmental matters, minimum wage, unionization, data privacy, menu labeling, immigration requirements and taxes, and an insufficient or ineffective response to government regulation may impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability.

The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations.  The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements.  We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions.   These laws cover wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety, and immigration, among others.  The myriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multi-state employer as different standards apply to different locations, sometimes with conflicting requirements.  We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.

We also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the ADA.  Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation.  New or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs.

Provisions in the Affordable Care Act require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request; however, regulations implementing those statutory provisions have been delayed until May 2018.  We do not expect to incur any material costs from compliance with these provisions, but cannot anticipate any changes to guest behavior resulting from the implementation of this portion of the law, which could have an adverse effect on our sales or results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by United States and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions.  Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.


We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud.  An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information.  Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.

The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could negatively impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.

A majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and we are committed to long-term and non-cancelable leases that we may want to cancel, and may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms.

As of

May 28, 2017

,

1,606

of our

1,695

restaurants operating in the United States and Canada operate in leased locations.  If we close a restaurant in a leased location, we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Additionally, the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels. As a result, ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations.  In addition, at the end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. As a result, we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance.

We may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.

Our restaurant operations are subject to United States and Canadian federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime and tip credits.  As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage.  Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs.  This in turn could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers’ compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors’ and officers’ liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs.  The dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers’ compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.

Our inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster such as a hurricane or manmade disaster, including terrorism, at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business.

Many of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Florida location.

We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.

Health concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.

The United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as norovirus, avian flu or “SARS,”  H1N1 or “swine flu,” or other diseases.  To the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived to be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product, or could reduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly.  For example, public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry. The


inability to serve poultry-based products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu items to our guests. If we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable. We also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors.  If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which could adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic, and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level. We also could be adversely affected if the World Health Organization and/or the Centers for Disease Control were to restrict travel to affected geographic areas where we source our products, thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply.  Additionally, jurisdictions in which we have restaurants may impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations.  Even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business.

We face intense competition, and if we have an insufficient focus on competition and the consumer landscape, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

The full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel, take-out and delivery options and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. We compete within each market with national and regional restaurant chains and locally-owned restaurants. We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, particularly in the supermarket industry which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants, type of brand, quality and efficiency of service, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will continue with respect to all of these factors. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Our failure to drive both short-term and long-term profitable sales growth through brand relevance, operating excellence, opening new restaurants of existing brands, and developing new dining brands could result in poor financial performance.

As part of our business strategy, we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing same-restaurant sales at existing restaurants, continuing to expand our current portfolio of restaurant brands, and developing additional brands that can be expanded profitably. This strategy involves numerous risks, and we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives.

At existing brands, we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable same-restaurant sales growth and warrant new unit growth.  Existing brand short-term sales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near term guest count and sales growth, and long-term sales growth could be impacted if we fail to extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests.  A failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and occasions in order to generate sustainable same-restaurant traffic growth and produce non-traditional sales and earnings growth opportunities, insufficient focus on our competition, or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, we may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants, and the new restaurants that we open may not be profitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants. New restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins normalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation.  The opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants.

The ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay construction, increases in labor and building material costs, the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business conditions.  At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources.  If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods.

We also may not be able to identify and integrate additional brands or develop new business opportunities that are as profitable as our existing restaurants.


A lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations.  As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation.  The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.

Our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants.  We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate or remodel existing restaurants.  The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated.  An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.

There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons.  Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted.  Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business.  The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information’s accuracy.

Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete.  As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance. As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests.  We also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their awareness of, engagement with, and loyalty to our brands. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition.  In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information,  fraud, or out-of-date information.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.

A failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics, ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives, and increased advertising and marketing costs, could adversely affect our results of operations.

If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   A failure to sufficiently innovate, develop guest relationship initiatives, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.

As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests.  These initiatives may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, as discussed below under the heading: “Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.”


A failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders, the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills, or an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could impact our strategic direction and jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.

Our future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other employees.  Our future growth also depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees to work in and manage our restaurants.  We must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees in order to maintain our current business and support our projected growth.  Changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives.  A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support leadership excellence (adequate resources, innovative skill sets and expectations) and build adequate bench strength required for growth, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of high-quality restaurant employees, and an inability to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization which could jeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets.

A failure to address cost pressures, including rising costs for commodities, labor, health care and utilities used by our restaurants, and a failure to effectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing, could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and results of operations.

Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food, ingredients, labor, health care, utilities and other related costs over which we may have little control.  Operating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including shrimp, lobster, crab and other seafood, as well as beef, pork, chicken, cheese and produce.  The introduction of or changes to tariffs on imported food products, such as shrimp, could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products.   We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  We attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, but there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively.  We are subject to the general risks of inflation.

Increases in minimum wage, health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs. We operate in many states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. Increases in minimum wage may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for non-minimum wage positions

Our restaurants’ operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise, on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply.  In addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other utilities, whether due to aging infrastructure, weather conditions, fire, animal damage, trees, digging accidents or other reasons largely out of our control, may adversely affect our operations.  Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from our third party vendors and suppliers.

Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and earthquakes; the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market or remain solvent given disruptions in the financial markets; or other conditions beyond our control.  Such shortages or interruptions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. We may have a limited number of suppliers for certain of our products.  Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our restaurant operations.  If we raise prices as a result of increased food costs or shortages, it may negatively impact our sales.  If we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant’s menu, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits.

Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our restaurant sales.

Adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our restaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and, in more severe cases such as hurricanes, tornadoes or other natural disasters, cause temporary closures, sometimes for prolonged periods, which would negatively impact our restaurant sales.  Changes in weather could result in construction delays, interruptions to the availability of utilities, and shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies, which could increase our costs.  Some climatologists predict that the long-term effects of climate change and global warming may result in more severe, volatile weather or extended droughts, which could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations.


Volatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.

We use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient, labor and energy costs, including but not limited to coffee, butter, wheat, soybean oil, pork, beef, diesel fuel, gasoline and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings.  These gains and losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings included in our consolidated financial statements.

Certain economic and business factors specific to the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors including unemployment, energy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our results of operations.

Our business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control.  The full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands.  The performance of individual restaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.

General economic conditions may also adversely affect our results of operations.  Recessionary economic cycles, a protracted economic slowdown, a worsening economy, increased unemployment, increased energy prices, rising interest rates, a downgrade of the U.S. government’s long-term credit rating, the European debt crisis, or other industry-wide cost pressures could affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings.  Job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and falling home prices could cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average profit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance.  In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs increase, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have lower disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out, may spend less on each dining out occasion or may choose more inexpensive restaurants.

Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such as the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could affect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.

Unfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs, reduce traffic in some or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations.

Disruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns, affect the availability and cost of credit and increase pension plan expenses.

Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged, and the availability and cost of credit in the future. There can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins.  A lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers, landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which we are located.  If these issues occur, they could negatively affect our financial results.  Any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the U.S. and world economy, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns. Changes in the capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan.  Our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plan for some of our employees, the weighted average asset allocation and long-term rate of return of our pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the interest cost component of our net periodic pension cost.  If our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return, or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate, our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan.


We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees.

Certain of our domestic and all of our international locations are operated by franchisees or licensees.  We believe that we have selected high-caliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and are providing them with training and support.  However, the probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or licensee.  If the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand values could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets.

We are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships.  There is no assurance that international operations will be profitable or that international growth will continue.  Our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency fluctuations, and differing cultures and consumer preferences.  In addition, expansion into international markets could create risks to our brands and reputation.

We also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and applicable local law.  Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.

service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement.  We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.  However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons.  Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.  In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant.  Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.

Impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates.  Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We are required to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily the LongHorn Steakhouse

®

, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen

®

,

The Capital Grille

®

, Yard House

®

and Eddie V’s Prime Seafood

®

trademarks, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived.  Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

As with goodwill, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We cannot accurately


predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.

Failure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results, affect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud.  Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant companies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting.  Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.  A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock, increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.

A change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is effective.  New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future.  Changes to existing accounting rules or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results.  Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to, revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, derivatives, pension and post-retirement benefits, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-based compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us.  Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.

(collectively, Eddie V’s) trademarks. We own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for


joint venture restaurants managed by us and


franchised restaurants.  We also have


franchised restaurants in operation located in Latin America, the Middle East and Malaysia.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

On April 24, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen for

$799.0 million

in total consideration.  The acquired operations of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen included 140 company-owned restaurants and 25 franchised restaurants. The results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition.  See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report) for further details.

We believe that capable operators of strong, multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s full-service segment. Generally, the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual, and full service. All of our restaurants fall within the full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains.  We believe we have strong brands and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service segment of the restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things.

With a focus on growing same-restaurant sales, we’ve implemented a “Back-to-Basics” approach rooted in strong operating fundamentals.  We’re focused on improving culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands, delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests, and creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants.  We support these priorities with smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests.  By delivering on these operational and brand-building imperatives, we expect to increase our market share through new restaurant and same-restaurant sales growth and deliver best-in-class profitability.

The Darden support structure enables our brands to achieve their ultimate potential by: (1) driving advantages in supply chain and general and administrative support; (2) applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth; and (3) relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement, operating with a sense of urgency and inspiring a performance-driven culture.

We seek to increase profits by leveraging our fixed and semi-fixed costs with sales from new restaurants and increased guest traffic and sales at existing restaurants. To evaluate our operations and assess our financial performance, we monitor a number of operating measures, with a special focus on two key factors:

•

Same-restaurant sales – which is a year-over-year 52-week comparison of each period’s sales volumes for restaurants open at least 16 months, including recently acquired restaurants, regardless of when the restaurants were acquired; and

•

Segment profit – which is restaurant sales, less food and beverage costs, restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses and marketing expenses (sometimes referred to as restaurant-level earnings).

Increasing same-restaurant sales can improve segment profit because these incremental sales provide better leverage of our fixed and semi-fixed restaurant-level costs. A restaurant brand can generate same-restaurant sales increases through increases in guest traffic, increases in the average guest check, or a combination of the two. The average guest check can be impacted by menu price changes and by the mix of menu items sold. For each restaurant brand, we gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing, product offerings and promotional strategies. We focus on balancing our pricing and product offerings with other initiatives to produce sustainable same-restaurant sales growth. We compute same-restaurant sales using restaurants open at least 16 months because this period is generally


required for new restaurant sales levels to normalize. Sales at newly opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of operation due to operating inefficiencies. Our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and closings, and relocations and remodeling of existing restaurants. Pre-opening expenses each period reflect the costs associated with opening new restaurants in current and future periods.

increase in sales from continuing operations was driven by a combined Darden same-restaurant sales increase of

1.8 percent

, excluding Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, and the addition of


net new company-owned restaurants plus the addition of 140 Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen purchased restaurants.

Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


were

$482.5 million

(

$3.83

per diluted share) compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


of

$359.7 million

(

$2.78

per diluted share). Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


increased

34.1 percent

and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased

37.8 percent

compared with fiscal


.

Our net loss from discontinued operations was

$3.4 million

(

$0.03

per diluted share) for fiscal


, compared with net earnings from discontinued operations of

$15.3 million

(

$0.12

per diluted share) for fiscal


. When combined with results from continuing operations, our diluted net earnings per share were

$3.80

and

$2.90

for fiscal


and


, respectively.

Outlook

We expect combined Darden same-restaurant sales to increase in fiscal


between 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent, and we expect fiscal


sales from continuing operations to increase between 11.5 percent and 13.0 percent, including Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen. In fiscal


, we expect to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants, including Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants, remodel and maintain existing restaurants and technology initiatives to be between $400.0 million and $450.0 million.

In

June 2017

, we announced a quarterly dividend of

$0.63

per share, payable on

August 1, 2017

.  Based on the

$0.63

quarterly dividend declaration, our expected annual dividend is

$2.52

per share, which reflects an increase of

12.5 percent

compared to our fiscal


annual dividend. Dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and, accordingly, the timing and amount of our dividends are subject to change.

There are significant risks and challenges that could impact our operations and ability to increase sales and earnings. The restaurant industry is intensely competitive and sensitive to economic cycles and other business factors, including changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits. Other risks and uncertainties are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this report.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL


,


AND


To facilitate review of our results of operations, the following table sets forth our financial results for the periods indicated.  All information is derived from the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended

May 28, 2017

,

May 29, 2016

and

May 31, 2015

.

The following table details the number of company-owned restaurants currently reported in continuing operations, compared with the number open at the end of fiscal


and the end of fiscal


.

(1)

Includes

six

locations in Canada for all periods presented.

(2)

Includes the 140 Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurants acquired on April 24, 2017.


SALES

The following table presents our company-owned restaurant sales and U.S. same-restaurant sales (SRS) by brand for the periods indicated.

(1)

Same-restaurant sales is a year-over-year comparison of each period’s sales volumes for a 52-week year and is limited to restaurants open at least 16 months.

(2)

Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen sales from company-owned restaurants are reflected for the period April 24, 2017 through May 28, 2017.

The following table presents our average annual sales per restaurant by brand for the periods indicated.  Average annual sales are calculated as net sales divided by total restaurant operating weeks multiplied by 52 weeks.

(1)

Excludes Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen due to the proximity of the acquisition to our fiscal 2017 year end.

Olive Garden’s sales increase for fiscal


was primarily driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase.   The increase in U.S. same-restaurant sales in fiscal


resulted from a

2.4 percent

increase in average check combined with a

0.2 percent

increase in same-restaurant guest counts.  Olive Garden’s sales increase for fiscal


was driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase partially offset by the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal


. The increase in U.S. same-restaurant sales in fiscal


resulted from a

2.0 percent

increase in average check combined with a

1.1 percent

increase in same-restaurant guest counts.

LongHorn Steakhouse’s sales increase for fiscal


was driven by a same-restaurant sales increase combined with revenue from new restaurants.  The increase in same-restaurant sales in fiscal


resulted from a

1.6 percent

increase in average check partially offset by a

0.4 percent

decrease in same-restaurant guest counts.   LongHorn Steakhouse’s sales increase for fiscal


was driven by a same-restaurant sales increase combined with revenue from new restaurants, partially offset by the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal


.  The increase in same-restaurant sales in fiscal


resulted from a

3.0 percent

increase in average check combined with a

0.5 percent

increase in same-restaurant guest counts.

In total, The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Yard House and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen generated sales in fiscal


and


that were

6.7 percent

and

5.3 percent

above fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively.  The sales increase for fiscal


was primarily driven by the Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen acquisition and the incremental sales from new Yard House restaurants.  Sales growth also reflected same-restaurant sales increases at The Capital Grille, Bahama Breeze and Eddie V’s in fiscal


, partially offset by a same-restaurant sales decrease at Yard House. The sales increase for fiscal


was


primarily driven by incremental sales from new Yard House restaurants and same-restaurant sales increases at all five brands partially offset by the impact of the 53

rd

week in fiscal


.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

The following table sets forth selected operating data as a percent of sales from continuing operations for the periods indicated.  This information is derived from the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended

May 28, 2017

,

May 29, 2016

and

May 31, 2015

.

Total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations were

$6.49 billion

in fiscal


,

$6.31 billion

in fiscal


and

$6.40 billion

in fiscal


.  As a percent of sales, total costs and expenses from continuing operations were

in fiscal


,

91.0 percent

in fiscal


and

94.6 percent

in fiscal


.

Fiscal


Compared to Fiscal


:

•

Food and beverage costs decreased as a percent of sales as a result of pricing, cost savings initiatives and food cost deflation, primarily beef.

•

Restaurant labor costs were flat as a percent of sales as wage-rate inflation was offset by sales leverage and improved productivity.

•

Restaurant expenses (which include rent, utilities, repairs and maintenance, credit card, property tax, workers’ compensation, new restaurant pre-opening and other restaurant-level operating expenses) increased as a percent of sales, primarily due to higher rent expense resulting from leasebacks of properties included in the spin-off of Four Corners Property Trust (Four Corners) and individual sale-leasebacks (collectively, real estate transactions), partially offset by sales leverage.

•

Marketing expenses decreased as a percent of sales as sales leverage was mostly offset by higher media cost.

•

General and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales, primarily due to expenses incurred in fiscal


related to the real estate plan implementation partially offset by a pension settlement charge and expenses incurred in fiscal


related to the acquisition and integration of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

•

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percent of sales primarily from the impact of the real estate transactions.

•

Impairments and disposal of assets, net, were lower as a percent of sales due the benefit from lease termination and asset disposal gains in fiscal 2017 compared to restaurant-related impairments in fiscal 2016.


Fiscal


Compared to Fiscal


:

•

Food and beverage costs decreased as a percent of sales as a result of favorable menu mix and pricing, cost savings initiatives and food cost deflation, primarily seafood and dairy.

•

Restaurant labor costs were flat as a percent of sales as wage-rate inflation, higher manager bonus and salary costs were offset by sales leverage.

•

Restaurant expenses (which include utilities, repairs and maintenance, credit card, lease, property tax, workers’ compensation, new restaurant pre-opening and other restaurant-level operating expenses) increased as a percent of sales, primarily as a result of increased rent expense partially offset by sales leverage and cost savings initiatives.

•

Marketing expenses decreased as a percent of sales, primarily as a result of sales leverage.

•

General and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses incurred in fiscal 2016 related to the real estate plan implementation as compared to the strategic action plan costs incurred in fiscal 2015.  General and administrative expenses as a percent of sales also decreased as a result of sales leverage, support cost savings and the favorable settlement of legal matters.

•

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percent of sales primarily from the impact of the real estate transactions and sales leverage.

•

Impairments and disposal of assets, net, decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to higher restaurant-related impairments in fiscal 2015.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal


primarily due to debt retirement costs of

$106.8 million

recorded in fiscal


and lower average debt balances in fiscal


as compared to fiscal 2016 due to the repayment of debt with proceeds from the real estate transactions and additional cash on hand.  Net interest expense decreased as a percent of sales in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower average debt balances in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 related to the retirement of $1.03 billion in principal of long-term debt in fiscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by higher debt retirement costs of $106.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to debt retirement costs of $91.3 million in fiscal 2015.

INCOME TAXES

The effective income tax rates for fiscal


,


and


for continuing operations were

24.3 percent

,

20.0 percent

and

(12.0) percent

, respectively.  The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal


compared to fiscal


and for fiscal


compared to fiscal


was primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was negative in fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of certain tax credits on lower earnings before income taxes driven primarily by costs incurred related to our strategic action plan.

NET EARNINGS AND NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


were

$482.5 million

(

$3.83

per diluted share) compared with net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


of

$359.7 million

(

$2.78

per diluted share) and net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


of

$196.4 million

(

$1.51

per diluted share).

Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


increased

34.1 percent

and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased

37.8 percent

compared with fiscal


, primarily due to increased sales, lower food and beverage costs, marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and impairments and disposal of assets, net as a percent of sales, partially offset by higher restaurant expenses as a percent of sales and a higher effective income tax rate.  Our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal


were adversely impacted by approximately $0.10 due to a non-cash pension settlement charge and approximately $0.09 related to the acquisition and integration of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal


increased

83.1 percent

and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased

84.1 percent

compared with fiscal


, primarily due to increased sales, lower food and beverage costs, marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses and impairments and disposal of assets, net as a percent of sales, partially offset by higher restaurant expenses as a percent of sales and a higher effective income tax rate.  Our diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal


were adversely impacted by approximately $0.51 due to debt retirement costs and approximately $0.26 related to the real estate plan implementation and positively impacted by approximately $0.02 due to a tax benefit associated with the prior year lobster aquaculture divestiture.


EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On an after-tax basis, results from discontinued operations for fiscal


were a net loss of

$3.4 million

(

$0.03

per diluted share) compared with earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal


of

$15.3 million

(

$0.12

per diluted share) and fiscal


of

$513.1 million

(

$3.96

per diluted share). Earnings from discontinued operations reflects pre-tax gains of $17.9 million recorded in fiscal


and $837.0 million in fiscal


, related to the sale of Red Lobster.

SEGMENT RESULTS

We manage our restaurant brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s in North America as operating segments. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. Our four reportable segments are: (1) Olive Garden, (2) LongHorn Steakhouse, (3) Fine Dining and (4) Other Business.  See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report) for further details.

Our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. The following table presents segment profit margin for the periods indicated.

The decrease in Olive Garden’s segment profit margin for fiscal


was driven primarily by additional rent expense resulting from the real estate transactions. The growth in Olive Garden’s segment profit margin for fiscal


was driven primarily by leveraging positive same-restaurant sales, food and beverage cost favorability and cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by additional rent expense resulting from real estate transactions. LongHorn’s segment profit margins for fiscal


were flat as additional rent expense resulting from the real estate transactions was offset by food cost deflation. The growth in LongHorn’s segment profit margins for fiscal


was driven primarily by leveraging positive same-restaurant sales as well as improved cost of sales and lower marketing expense, partially offset by additional rent expense resulting from real estate transactions.  The growth in Fine Dining’s segment profit margins for fiscal


was driven primarily by food cost deflation, primarily beef, partially offset by higher restaurant expenses.  The growth in Fine Dining’s segment profit margins for fiscal


was driven primarily by improved food and beverage costs.  The Other Business segment profit margins for fiscal


were flat as food cost deflation was offset by higher labor costs. The growth for fiscal


was driven by positive same-restaurant sales leverage and lower food and beverage costs.

SEASONALITY

Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall.  Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

We attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning, operating practices and menu price increases. We do not believe inflation had a significant overall effect on our annual results of operations during fiscal


or fiscal


.  We experienced higher than normal inflationary costs during fiscal


and were able to partially reduce the annual impact utilizing these strategies.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).  Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Leases

We evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term, which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property and includes the non-cancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably assured to exercise. Our judgment in determining the appropriate expected term for each lease affects our evaluation of:

•

The classification and accounting for leases as capital versus operating;

•

The rent holidays and escalation in payments that are included in the calculation of straight-line rent; and

•

The term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized.

These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different expected lease terms were used.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

Land, buildings and equipment and certain other assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The judgments we make related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets, definitions of lease terms and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of these assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in usage or operating performance, desirability of the restaurant sites and other factors, such as our ability to sell our assets held for sale. As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, significant adverse changes in these factors could cause us to realize an impairment loss. Based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants, the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Trademarks

Goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The reporting units are our restaurant brands.  At

May 28, 2017

, we had the following amounts recorded as goodwill and trademarks at our brands:

(1)

Goodwill and trademark values for Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen represent preliminary estimates as the acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).


A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We performed our annual impairment test of our goodwill and trademarks as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter using a qualitative assessment. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests, operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. Based on the results of our qualitative assessment, no impairment of goodwill or trademarks was indicated.  Changes in circumstances existing at the measurement date or at other times in the future, or in the numerous estimates associated with management’s judgments and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our goodwill and trademarks, could result in an impairment loss of a portion or all of our goodwill or trademarks.  Due to the proximity of the acquisition to our fiscal 2017 year end, the preliminary estimates for goodwill and trademark related to Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen were not included in our qualitative assessment.

If our annual test resulted in an impairment of our goodwill or trademarks, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected and our leverage ratio for purposes of our credit agreement would increase. A leverage ratio exceeding the maximum permitted under our credit agreement would be a default under our credit agreement. At

May 28, 2017

, a write-down of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets, or any other assets in excess of approximately $1.08 billion would have been required to cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum. As our leverage ratio is determined on a quarterly basis, and due to the seasonal nature of our business, a lesser amount of impairment in future quarters could cause our leverage ratio to exceed the permitted maximum.

Unearned Revenues

Unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed. The estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed, generally over a period of 10 years. Utilizing this method, we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption. If actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates, actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded. We update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions. Changing our breakage-rate assumption on unredeemed gift cards by 25 basis points would result in an adjustment in our unearned revenues of approximately $21.0 million.

Income Taxes

We estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include, among other items, depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes and the tax deductibility of certain other items. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available.

Assessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts, timing and likelihood of resolution. As described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report), the

$16.4 million

balance of unrecognized tax benefits at

May 28, 2017

, includes

$0.7 million

related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations. The

$0.7 million

relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity, which we use to finance capital expenditures for new restaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants, to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Since substantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable are generally due in 5 to 45 days, we are able to carry current liabilities in excess of current assets. In addition to cash flows from operations, we use a combination of long-term and short-term borrowings to fund our capital needs.


We currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investment-grade bond rating, which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable costs. Currently, our publicly issued long-term debt carries “Baa3” (Moody’s Investors Service), “BBB” (Standard & Poor’s) and “BBB” (Fitch) ratings. Our commercial paper has ratings of “P-3” (Moody’s Investors Service), “A-2” (Standard & Poor’s) and “F-2” (Fitch). These ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities, may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

On

April 10, 2017

, we issued

$500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of unsecured

3.850 percent

senior notes due

May 2027

under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 6, 2016.  Discount and issuance costs, which totaled

$4.4 million

, are being amortized over the term of the notes using the straight-line method, the results of which approximate the effective interest method.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year commencing November 1, 2017.  We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the principal amount plus a make-whole premium.  If we experience a change in control triggering event, unless we have previously exercised our right to redeem the notes, we may be required to purchase the notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to

101 percent

of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We maintain a

$750.0 million

revolving Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement), with Bank of America, N.A. (BOA) as administrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party thereto.  The Revolving Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the Company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of

0.75

to 1.00) and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type.  As of

May 28, 2017

, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on

October 24, 2018

, and the proceeds may be used for commercial paper back-up, working capital and capital expenditures, the refinancing of certain indebtedness, certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes.  Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid (Applicable Margin), or the base rate (which is defined as the highest of the BOA prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus

0.500 percent

, and the Eurocurrency Rate plus

1.00 percent

) plus the Applicable Margin. Assuming a “BBB” equivalent credit rating level, the Applicable Margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement will be

1.100 percent

for LIBOR loans and

0.100 percent

for base rate loans. As of

May 28, 2017

, we had

no

outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

At

May 28, 2017

, our long-term debt consisted principally of:

•

$500.0 million of unsecured 3.850 percent senior notes due in May 2027;

•

$150.0 million of unsecured 6.000 percent senior notes due in August 2035; and

•

$300.0 million of unsecured 6.800 percent senior notes due in October 2037.

The interest rate on our

$300.0 million

6.800 percent

senior notes due

October 2037

is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level (or subsequently upgraded). The maximum adjustment is

2.000 percent

above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate. As of

May 28, 2017

, no such adjustments are made to this rate.

Through our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets, we may issue unsecured debt securities from time to time in one or more series, which may consist of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or more offerings.

From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors.

From time to time, we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).


A summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at

May 28, 2017

, is as follows:

(1)

Includes interest payments associated with existing long-term debt, including the current portion. Excludes discount and issuance costs of

$13.4 million

.

(2)

Inclusive of all arrangements accounted for as operating, capital and financing leases. Includes imputed interest of

$78.3 million

over the life of financing lease obligations and imputed interest of

$29.5 million

over the life of capital lease obligations.

(3)

Includes commitments for food and beverage items and supplies, capital projects, information technology and other miscellaneous commitments.

(4)

Includes expected contributions associated with our defined benefit plans and payments associated with our postretirement benefit plan and our non-qualified deferred compensation plan through fiscal


.

(5)

Includes interest on unrecognized income tax benefits of

$0.9 million

,

$0.1 million

of which relates to contingencies expected to be resolved within one year.

(6)

Includes letters of credit for

$127.5 million

of workers’ compensation and general liabilities accrued in our consolidated financial statements and letters of credit for

$10.6 million

related to contractual operating lease obligations and other payments.

(7)

Consists solely of guarantees associated with leased properties that have been assigned to third parties and are primarily related to the disposition of Red Lobster. We are not aware of any non-performance under these arrangements that would result in our having to perform in accordance with the terms of the guarantees.


Our fixed-charge coverage ratio, which measures the number of times each year that we earn enough to cover our fixed charges, amounted to

5.0

times and

2.7

times, on a continuing operations basis, for the fiscal years ended

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, respectively. Our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio (which includes

6.25

times the total annual minimum rent on a consolidated basis of $

303.5 million

and $

248.5 million

for the fiscal years ended

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, respectively, as components of adjusted debt and adjusted total capital) was

59 percent

and

53 percent

as of

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, respectively. We include the lease-debt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our adjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio reported to shareholders, as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is consistent with the calculation of the covenant under our Revolving Credit Agreement.

Based on these ratios, we believe our financial condition is strong. The composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were

$918.2 million

,

$820.4 million

and

$874.3 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively. Net cash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of

$482.5 million

,

$359.7 million

and

$196.4 million

in fiscal


,


and


, respectively. Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal


primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing operations partially offset by the timing of payments of accounts payable and current period activity of taxable timing differences. Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations decreased in fiscal


primarily due to current period activity of taxable timing differences and the timing of inventory purchases, offset by higher net earnings from continuing operations.

Net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were

$1.07 billion

in fiscal


compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities from continuing operations of

$75.4 million

in fiscal


and net cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations of

$235.1 million

in fiscal


.  Capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants, remodeling existing restaurants, replacing equipment, and technology initiatives were

$293.0 million

in fiscal


, compared to

$228.3 million

in fiscal


and

$296.5 million

in fiscal


. Additionally, for fiscal


, net cash used in the acquisition of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen was

$764.4 million

.  For fiscal


, proceeds from the disposal of land, buildings and equipment of

$325.2 million

reflect the impact of closed sale-leaseback transactions.

Net cash flows provided by financing activities from continuing operations were

$129.2 million

in fiscal


, compared to net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations of

$1.12 billion

in fiscal


and

and net repayments of short-term debt

, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.

Our defined benefit and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are determined using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits and Topic 712, Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of a discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.  We set the discount rate assumption annually for each plan at its valuation date to reflect the yield of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments, with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits. At

May 28, 2017

, our discount rate was

4.06 percent

and

3.98 percent

, respectively, for our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon several factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results, an analysis of current market conditions, asset allocations and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit plans was

6.5

percent for fiscal year


,

6.5

percent for fiscal year


and

7.0 percent

for fiscal year


.   We made defined benefit plans contributions of approximately

$0.4 million

,

$25.4 million

and

$0.4 million

in fiscal years


,


and


, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately

$0.4 million

to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately

$1.3 million

to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal


.

We have recognized net losses of

$70.1 million

(net of tax) and of

$0.3 million

(net of tax) as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan, respectively, as of

May 28, 2017

. These net losses represent changes in the amount of the projected benefit obligation and plan assets resulting from differences in the assumptions used and actual experience. The amortization of the net loss component of our fiscal


net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans is expected to be approximately $1.7 million (net of tax). The amortization of the net gain component of our fiscal


net periodic benefit cost for the postretirement benefit plan is expected to be approximately $1.9 million (net of tax).

We believe our defined benefit and postretirement benefit plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the factors discussed above. However, other assumptions could also be reasonably applied that could differ from the assumptions used. These changes in assumptions would not significantly impact our funding requirements.

We are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity. We believe that our internal cash-generating capabilities, the potential issuance of unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and short-term commercial paper should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, debt maturities, stock repurchase program and other operating activities through fiscal


.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our total current assets were

$799.8 million

at

May 28, 2017

, compared with

$820.3 million

at

May 29, 2016

. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by the acquisition of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

Our total current liabilities were

$1.29 billion

at

May 28, 2017

, compared with

$1.19 billion

at

May 29, 2016

. The increase was primarily due to an increase in unearned revenues associated with gift card sales in excess of redemptions.

APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report) for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.


Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, compensation and commodity prices. To manage this exposure, we periodically enter into interest rate and foreign currency exchange instruments, equity forward and commodity derivative instruments for other than trading purposes.  See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).

We use the variance/covariance method to measure value at risk, over time horizons ranging from one week to one year, at the 95 percent confidence level. At

May 28, 2017

, our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rate instruments, commodity instruments, equity forwards and floating-rate debt interest rate exposures were approximately $30.0 million over a period of one year. The value at risk from an increase in the fair value of all of our long-term fixed-rate debt, over a period of one year, was approximately $100.3 million. The fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt outstanding as of

May 28, 2017

, averaged $574.3 million, with a high of $1.06 billion and a low of $492.6 million during fiscal


. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixed-rate debt.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


REPORT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITIES

The management of Darden Restaurants, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, using management’s best estimates and judgments where appropriate. The financial information throughout this report is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.

Management has established a system of internal controls over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately safeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately, in all material respects, in accordance with management’s authorization. Our internal controls provide for appropriate segregation of duties and responsibilities and there are documented policies regarding utilization of our assets and proper financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly communicated policies set high standards of ethical conduct for all employees. We also maintain a strong audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of these internal controls.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets at least quarterly to determine that management, internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm are properly discharging their duties regarding internal control and financial reporting. Management, internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Their reports follow.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

May 28, 2017

. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)

. Management has concluded that, as of

May 28, 2017

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

May 28, 2017

, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $980.3 million and total revenues of

$63.0 million

in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended

May 28, 2017

.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which follows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Darden Restaurants, Inc.:

We have audited Darden Restaurants, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of

May 28, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Darden Restaurants, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

May 28, 2017

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Darden Restaurants, Inc. acquired Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen during 2017, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Darden Restaurants, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2017, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $980.3 million and total revenues of $63.0 million included in the consolidated financial statements of Darden Restaurants, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended May 28, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Darden Restaurants, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Darden Restaurants, Inc. as of

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

May 28, 2017

, and our report dated

July 21, 2017

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Operations and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of Darden Restaurants, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Darden, the Company, we, us or our). We own and operate the Olive Garden

®

, LongHorn Steakhouse

®

, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen

®

, The Capital Grille

®

, Yard House®, Bahama Breeze®, Seasons 52

®

, and Eddie V’s Prime Seafood

®

and Wildfish Seafood Grille

®

(collectively, “Eddie V’s”) restaurant brands located in the United States and Canada. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for


joint venture restaurants managed by us and


franchised restaurants.  We also have


franchised restaurants in operation located in Latin America, the Middle East and Malaysia.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Basis of Presentation

On April 24, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen for

$799.0 million

in total consideration.  The acquired operations of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen included


company-owned restaurants and


franchised restaurants. The results of operations, financial position and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information.

On November 9, 2015, we completed the spin-off of Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. (Four Corners) with the pro rata distribution of

one

share of common stock for every

three

shares of Darden common stock to Darden shareholders. The separation included the transfer of


LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants and


restaurant properties to Four Corners.

On July 28, 2014, we completed the sale of Red Lobster and certain related assets and associated liabilities.  For fiscal


,


and


, all gains and losses on disposition, impairment charges and disposal costs, along with the sales, costs and expenses and income taxes attributable to the discontinued locations, have been aggregated in a single caption entitled “Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax expense (benefit)” in our consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. See Note 3 for additional information.

Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements relate to our continuing operations.

We have reclassified certain amounts in prior-period financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation.

Fiscal Year

We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year, which ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal


, which ended

May 28, 2017

, consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal


, which ended

May 29, 2016

, consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal


, which ended

May 31, 2015

, consisted of 53 weeks.

Use of Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments such as U.S. Treasury bills, taxable municipal bonds and money market funds that have an original maturity of three months or less.  Amounts receivable from credit card companies are also considered cash equivalents because they are both short term and highly liquid in nature and are typically converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction. The components of cash and cash equivalents are as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

As of

May 28, 2017

, and

May 29, 2016

, we had cash and cash equivalent accounts in excess of insured limits. We manage the credit risk of our positions through utilizing multiple financial institutions and monitoring the credit quality of those financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents.

Receivables, Net

Receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represent their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on historical collection experience and the age of the receivables. Receivables are written off when they are deemed uncollectible. See Note 12 for additional information.

Inventories

Inventories consist of food and beverages and are valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or market.

Marketable Securities

Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon management’s intended holding period, the security’s maturity date, or both. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are carried in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the consolidated financial statements and are reclassified into earnings when the securities mature or are sold.

Land, Buildings and Equipment, Net

Land, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Building components are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of buildings in land, buildings and equipment, net, are amortized over the lesser of the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Equipment is depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years also using the straight-line method. See Note 5 for additional information. Gains and losses on the disposal of land, buildings and equipment are included in impairments and disposal of assets, net, while the write-off of undepreciated book value associated with the replacement of equipment in the normal course of business is recorded as a component of restaurant expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations associated with buildings and equipment and losses on replacement of equipment were as follows:

Capitalized Software Costs and Other Definite-Lived Intangibles

Capitalized software, which is a component of other assets, is recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Capitalized software is amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years. The cost of capitalized software and related accumulated amortization was as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

We have other definite-lived intangible assets, including assets related to the value of below-market leases resulting from our acquisitions that are included as a component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We also have definite-lived intangible liabilities related to the value of above-market leases and below-market agreements resulting from our acquisitions that are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of


to


years. The cost and related accumulated amortization was as follows:

Amortization expense from continuing operations associated with capitalized software and other definite-lived intangibles included in depreciation and amortization in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was as follows:

Amortization expense from continuing operations associated with above- and-below-market leases included in restaurant expenses as a component of rent expense in our consolidated statements of earnings was as follows:

Amortization of capitalized software and other definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately

$21.4 million

annually for fiscal


through


.

Trust-Owned Life Insurance

We have a trust that purchased life insurance policies covering certain of our officers and other key employees (trust-owned life insurance or TOLI). The trust is the owner and sole beneficiary of the TOLI policies. The policies were purchased to offset a portion of our obligations under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The cash surrender value for each policy is included in other assets, while changes in cash surrender values are included in general and administrative expenses.

Liquor Licenses

The costs of obtaining non-transferable liquor licenses that are directly issued by local government agencies for nominal fees are expensed as incurred. The costs of purchasing transferable liquor licenses through open markets in jurisdictions with a limited number of authorized liquor licenses are capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets and included in other assets. Liquor licenses are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Annual liquor license renewal fees are expensed over the renewal term.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Goodwill and Trademarks

We review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill and trademarks are not subject to amortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The reporting units are our restaurant brands. Our goodwill and trademark balances are allocated as follows:

(1)

Goodwill related to Olive Garden is associated with the RARE Hospitality International, Inc. (RARE) acquisition and the estimated value of the direct benefits derived by Olive Garden as a result of the RARE acquisition.

(2)

Goodwill and trademark values for Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen represent preliminary estimates as the acquisition was completed on April 24, 2017. See Note 2 for additional information.

A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

We elected to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired.  In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests, operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, no impairment of goodwill was indicated for any of our brands. As Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the preliminary estimate of goodwill allocated to that brand was not included in our qualitative assessment.

If the qualitative assessment is not performed or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated through a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. We estimate fair value using the best information available, including market information and discounted cash flow projections (also referred to as the income approach).  The income approach uses a reporting unit’s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions. The projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales, costs and number of units, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates, future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. We validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow and sales multiples to the reporting unit’s operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is higher than its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, we would record an impairment loss for the difference.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

A qualitative assessment was also performed for the trademarks. As Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the preliminary estimate of the Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen trademark was not included in our qualitative assessment. In considering the qualitative approach, we evaluate similar factors from the goodwill assessment, in addition to impacts of royalty rates and discount factors. We completed our impairment test and concluded as of the date of the test, there was

no

impairment of our trademarks.

We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. A determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

Land, buildings and equipment and certain other assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities, generally at the restaurant level. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined based on appraisals, sales prices of comparable assets or discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Restaurant sites and certain other assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Restaurant sites and certain other assets to be disposed of are included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets when certain criteria are met. These criteria include the requirement that the likelihood of disposing of these assets within one year is probable. Assets not meeting the “held for sale” criteria remain in land, buildings and equipment until their disposal is probable within one year.

We account for exit or disposal activities, including restaurant closures, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. Such costs include the cost of disposing of the assets as well as other facility-related expenses from previously closed restaurants. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. Additionally, at the date we cease using a property under an operating lease, we record a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligations, net of estimated sublease income. Any subsequent adjustments to that liability as a result of lease termination or changes in estimates of sublease income are recorded in the period incurred. Upon disposal of the assets, primarily land, associated with a closed restaurant, any gain or loss is recorded in the same caption within our consolidated statements of earnings as the original impairment. See Note 4 for additional information.

Insurance Accruals

Through the use of insurance program deductibles and self-insurance, we retain a significant portion of expected losses under our workers’ compensation, certain employee medical and general liability programs. Accrued liabilities have been recorded based on our estimates of the anticipated ultimate costs to settle all claims, both reported and not yet reported.

Revenue Recognition

Sales, as presented in our consolidated statements of earnings, represents food and beverage product sold and is presented net of discounts, coupons, employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis within sales in our consolidated statements of earnings.

Revenue from the sale of franchises is recognized as income when substantially all of our material obligations under the franchise agreement have been performed. Continuing royalties, which are a percentage of net sales of franchised restaurants, are accrued as income when earned.  Revenue from the sale of consumer packaged goods includes ongoing royalty fees based on a percentage of licensed retail product sales and is recognized upon the sale of product by our licensed manufacturers to retail outlets.

Unearned Revenues

Unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed.  We recognize sales from our gift cards when the gift card is redeemed by the customer.  Although there are

no

expiration dates or dormancy fees for our gift cards, based on our analysis of our historical gift card redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote, which is referred to as “breakage.”   We recognize breakage within sales for unused gift card amounts in proportion to actual gift card redemptions, which is also referred to as the “redemption recognition” method.  The


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

estimated value of gift cards expected to remain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed, generally over a period of


years.  Utilizing this method, we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption.  If actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates, actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded.  We update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions.

Food and Beverage Costs

Food and beverage costs include inventory, warehousing, related purchasing and distribution costs, and gains and losses on certain commodity derivative contracts. Vendor allowances received in connection with the purchase of a vendor’s products are recognized as a reduction of the related food and beverage costs as earned. Advance payments are made by the vendors based on estimates of volume to be purchased from the vendors and the terms of the agreement. As we make purchases from the vendors each period, we recognize the pro rata portion of allowances earned as a reduction of food and beverage costs for that period. Differences between estimated and actual purchases are settled in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Vendor agreements are generally for a period of one year or more and payments received are initially recorded as long-term liabilities. Amounts expected to be earned within one year are recorded as current liabilities.

Income Taxes

We provide for federal and state income taxes currently payable as well as for those deferred because of temporary differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Federal income tax credits are recorded as a reduction of income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Interest recognized on reserves for uncertain tax positions is included in interest, net, in our consolidated statements of earnings. A corresponding liability for accrued interest is included as a component of other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Penalties, when incurred, are recognized in general and administrative expenses.

ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized (or derecognized) in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 13 for additional information.

Income tax benefits credited to equity relate to tax benefits associated with amounts that are deductible for income tax purposes but do not affect earnings. These benefits are principally generated from employee exercises of non-qualified stock options and vesting of employee restricted stock awards.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments as required by FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and those utilized as economic hedges. We use financial derivatives to manage interest rate and compensation risks inherent in our business operations. Our use of derivative instruments is currently limited to equity forwards contracts. These instruments are generally structured as hedges of the variability of cash flows related to forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). However, we do at times enter into instruments designated as fair value hedges to reduce our exposure to changes in fair value of the related hedged item. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes, where changes in the cash flows or fair value of the derivative are not expected to offset changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item. However, we have entered into equity forwards to economically hedge changes in the fair value of employee investments in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan.  All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For those derivative instruments for which we intend to elect hedge accounting, on the date the derivative contract is entered into, we document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.

To the extent our derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, and otherwise meet the cash flow hedge accounting criteria required by Topic 815 of the FASB ASC, changes in the derivatives’ fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. These changes in fair value will be reclassified into earnings at the time of the forecasted transaction. Ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

recorded currently in earnings in the period in which it occurs. To the extent our derivatives are effective in mitigating changes in fair value, and otherwise meet the fair value hedge accounting criteria required by Topic 815 of the FASB ASC, gains and losses in the derivatives’ fair value are included in current earnings, as are the gains and losses of the related hedged item. To the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the derivative contracts are utilized as economic hedges, and changes in the fair value of such contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which they occur. Cash flows related to derivatives are included in operating activities. See Note 8 for additional information.

Leases

For operating leases, we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term, including cancelable option periods where we are reasonably assured to exercise the options. Differences between amounts paid and amounts expensed are recorded as deferred rent. Capital leases are recorded as an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term.  Sale-leasebacks are transactions through which we sell assets (such as restaurant properties) at fair value and subsequently lease them back.  The resulting leases generally qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. Financing leases are generally the product of a failed sale-leaseback transaction and result in retention of the “sold” assets within land, buildings and equipment with a financing lease obligation equal to the amount of proceeds received recorded as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Within the provisions of certain of our leases, there are rent holidays and escalations in payments over the base lease term, as well as renewal periods. The effects of the holidays and escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The lease term commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property, which is typically before rent payments are due under the terms of the lease. Many of our leases have renewal periods totaling


to


years, exercisable at our option, and require payment of property taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. The consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease term for amortizing leasehold improvements as we use to determine capital versus operating lease classifications and in calculating straight-line rent expense for each restaurant. Percentage rent expense is generally based on sales levels and is accrued at the point in time we determine that it is probable that such sales levels will be achieved. Amortization expense related to capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of earnings. Landlord allowances are recorded based on contractual terms and are included in accounts receivable, net, and as a deferred rent liability and amortized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Gains on sale-leaseback transactions are recorded as a deferred liability and amortized as a reduction of rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.  See Note 11 for additional information.

Pre-Opening Expenses

Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new restaurants are expensed as incurred.

Advertising

Production costs of commercials are charged to operations in the fiscal period the advertising is first aired. The costs of programming and other advertising, promotion and marketing programs are charged to operations in the fiscal period incurred and reported as marketing expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation

We recognize the cost of employee service received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards.  We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee service period for awards granted. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The dividend yield has been estimated based upon our historical results and expectations for changes in dividend rates. The expected volatility was determined using historical stock prices. The risk-free interest rate was the rate available on zero coupon U.S. government obligations with a term approximating the expected life of each grant. The expected life was estimated based on the exercise history of previous grants, taking into consideration the remaining contractual period for outstanding awards.  We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of our market-based equity-settled performance awards. See Note 15 for further information.

Net Earnings per Share

Basic net earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted net earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Outstanding stock options, restricted stock and equity-settled performance stock units granted by us represent the only dilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. These stock-based compensation instruments do not impact the numerator of the diluted net earnings per share computation.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per common share:

Restricted stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock excluded from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive, are as follows:

Foreign Currency

The Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian restaurant operations. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss). Aggregate cumulative translation losses were

$0.7 million

and

$1.2 million

at

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, respectively. Net losses from foreign currency transactions recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings were

Application of New Accounting Standards

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This update provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is when we plan to adopt these provisions.  This update permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method, however we have not yet selected a transition method. Upon initial evaluation, we do not believe this guidance will impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurants, which is our primary source of revenue.  We are continuing to evaluate the effect this guidance will have on other, less significant revenue sources, including franchises and consumer packaged goods.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330).  This update requires inventory within the scope of the standard to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is when we plan to adopt these provisions.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740).  This update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is when we plan to adopt these provisions.  Other than the revised balance sheet presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  This update requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a corresponding right-of-use asset.  The guidance also requires certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which is when we plan to adopt these provisions. We plan to elect the available practical expedients on adoption.  We expect our balance sheet presentation to be materially impacted upon adoption due to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases.  However, we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of earnings.  We do not expect our accounting for capital leases to substantially change.  We are continuing to evaluate the effect this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  This update was issued as part of the FASB’s simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees.  The amendments in this update cover such areas as the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies, the classification of those excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, an accounting policy election for forfeitures, the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes and still qualify for equity classification and the classification of those taxes paid on the statement of cash flows.  This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is when we plan to adopt these provisions.  This guidance will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method, depending on the area covered in this update.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).  This update provides clarification regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  This update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.  This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using a retrospective approach.  Early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740).  This update addresses the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  Current GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party.  In addition, interpretations of this guidance have developed in practice over the years for transfers of certain intangible and tangible assets.  The amendments in the update will require recognition of current and deferred income taxes resulting from an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  This update is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted.   We plan to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.  We do not expect this adjustment to be material.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715).  The amendments in this update require that an employer disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net benefit cost. The amendments also provide explicit guidance on how to present the service cost component and the other components of net benefit cost in the income statement and allow only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization.  This update is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The guidance will be applied retrospectively or prospectively, depending on the area covered in this update. Early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 2 - ACQUISITION OF CHEDDAR’S SCRATCH KITCHEN

On April 24, 2017, we acquired

100 percent

of the equity interest in Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen for

$799.0 million

in total consideration.  We funded the acquisition with the proceeds from the issuance of

$500.0 million

in senior notes combined with cash on hand.  The acquired operations of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen included


company-owned restaurants and


franchised restaurants. The results of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

The assets and liabilities of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition.  We are in the process of confirming, through internal studies and third-party valuations, the fair value of these assets, including land, buildings and equipment, intangible assets, and income tax assets and liabilities. The fair values set forth below are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained. When the valuation process is completed, adjustments to goodwill may result.

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill.  Of the

$329.4 million

recorded as goodwill,

none

is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  The portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents benefits expected as a result of the acquisition, including sales and unit growth opportunities in addition to supply-chain and support-cost synergies. The trademark has an indefinite life based on the expected use of the asset and the regulatory and economic environment within which it is being used. The trademark represents a highly respected brand with positive connotations and we intend to cultivate and protect the use of this brand. Goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Buildings and equipment will be depreciated over a period of

2 years

to

20 years

.

As a result of the acquisition and related integration efforts, we incurred expenses of approximately

$16.3 million

during the year ended

May 28, 2017

, which are included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings.  Pro-forma financial information of the combined entities for periods prior to the acquisition is not presented due to the immaterial impact of the financial results of Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

Discontinued Operations

Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings is primarily related to the Red Lobster disposition and is comprised of the following:

(1)

Amounts for fiscal years 2016 and 2015 primarily relate to the gain recognized on the sale of Red Lobster.

Assets Held For Sale

Assets classified as held for sale on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, consisted of land, buildings and equipment with carrying amounts of

$13.2 million

and

$20.3 million

NOTE 4 –IMPAIRMENTS AND DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, NET

Impairments and disposal of assets, net, in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings are comprised of the following:

Restaurant impairments for fiscal


and


were primarily related to underperforming restaurants and restaurant assets involved in individual sale-leaseback transactions.

Disposal gains for fiscal


were primarily related to the sale of restaurant properties, favorable lease terminations and the sale of excess land parcels.  Disposal gains for fiscal


and


were primarily related to the sale of land parcels and sale-leaseback transactions.

Other impairment charges for fiscal


primarily related to a cost-method investment, which has

no

remaining carrying value.  During fiscal


, other impairment charges related to a cost-method investment and the expected disposal of excess land parcels adjacent to our corporate headquarters.  Other impairment charges for fiscal


primarily related to the expected disposal of excess land parcels adjacent to our corporate headquarters, our lobster aquaculture project and a corporate airplane in connection with the closure of our aviation department.

Impairment charges were measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value.  Fair value is generally determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets and estimates of discounted future cash flows.  These amounts are included in impairments and disposal of assets, net as a component of earnings from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

NOTE 6 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

We manage our restaurant brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s in North America as operating segments. The brands operate principally in the U.S. within full-service dining.  We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. We have

four

reportable segments: (1) Olive Garden, (2) LongHorn Steakhouse, (3) Fine Dining and (4) Other Business.

The Olive Garden segment includes the results of our company-owned Olive Garden restaurants in the U.S. and Canada.  The LongHorn Steakhouse segment includes the results of our company-owned LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in the U.S.  The Fine Dining segment aggregates our premium brands that operate within the fine-dining sub-segment of full-service dining and includes the results of our company-owned The Capital Grille and Eddie V’s restaurants in the U.S.  The Other Business segment aggregates our remaining brands and includes the results of our company-owned Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze restaurants in the U.S.  This segment also includes results from our franchises and consumer-packaged goods sales.

External sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales, and the customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments.

Our management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments.  Segment profit includes revenues and expenses directly attributable to restaurant-level results of operations (sometimes referred to as restaurant-level earnings).  These expenses include food and beverage costs, restaurant labor costs, restaurant expenses and marketing expenses (collectively, restaurant and marketing expenses). The following tables reconcile our segment results to our consolidated results reported in accordance with GAAP:

NOTE 7 - DEBT

The components of long-term debt are as follows:

On

April 10, 2017

, we issued

$500.0 million

aggregate principal amount of unsecured

3.850 percent

senior notes due

May 2027

under a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 6, 2016.  Discount and issuance costs, which totaled

$4.4 million

, are being amortized over the term of the notes using the straight-line method, the results of which approximate the effective interest method.  Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year commencing November 1, 2017.  We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the principal amount plus a make-whole premium.  If we experience a change in control triggering event, unless we have previously exercised our right to redeem the notes, we may be required to purchase the notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to

101 percent

of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The interest rate on our

$300.0 million

6.800 percent

senior notes due

October 2037

is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to such series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level (or subsequently upgraded). The maximum adjustment is

2.000 percent

above the initial interest rate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate. As of

May 28, 2017

, no such adjustments are made to this rate.

The aggregate contractual maturities of long-term debt for each of the five fiscal years subsequent to

May 28, 2017

, and thereafter are as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

We maintain a

$750.0 million

revolving Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement), with Bank of America, N.A. (BOA) as administrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party thereto.  The Revolving Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the Company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of

0.75

to 1.00) and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type.  As of

May 28, 2017

, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on

October 24, 2018

, and the proceeds may be used for commercial paper back-up, working capital and capital expenditures, the refinancing of certain indebtedness, certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes.  Loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid (Applicable Margin), or the base rate (which is defined as the highest of the BOA prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus

0.500 percent

and the Eurocurrency Rate plus

1.00 percent

) plus the Applicable Margin. Assuming a “BBB” equivalent credit rating level, the Applicable Margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement will be

1.100 percent

for LIBOR loans and

0.100 percent

for base rate loans. As of

May 28, 2017

, we had

no

outstanding balances under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

We use financial derivatives to manage interest rate and equity-based compensation risks inherent in our business operations. By using these instruments, we expose ourselves, from time to time, to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. We currently do not have any provisions in our agreements with counterparties that would require either party to hold or post collateral in the event that the market value of the related derivative instrument exceeds a certain limit. As such, the maximum amount of loss due to counterparty credit risk we would incur at

May 28, 2017

, if counterparties to the derivative instruments failed completely to perform, would approximate the values of derivative instruments currently recognized as assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates, commodity prices or the market price of our common stock. We minimize this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal


we entered into Treasury lock derivative instruments with

$500.0 million

of notional value to hedge a portion of the risk of changes in the benchmark interest rate prior to the issuance of senior notes on April 10, 2017, as changes in the benchmark interest rate would cause variability in our forecasted interest payments.  These derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges and were settled at the issuance of the senior notes for a cumulative loss of

$1.3 million

.  This amount was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense on the senior notes or similar debt as incurred.

We enter into equity forward contracts to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows associated with the unvested, unrecognized Darden stock units. The equity forward contracts will be settled at the end of the vesting periods of their underlying Darden stock units, which range between

four

and

five

years and currently extend through

July 2021

. The contracts were initially designated as cash flow hedges to the extent the Darden stock units are unvested and, therefore, unrecognized as a liability in our financial statements. The forward contracts can only be net settled in cash. As the Darden stock units vest, we will de-designate that portion of the equity forward contract that no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, and changes in fair value associated with


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

that portion of the equity forward contract will be recognized in current earnings. We periodically incur interest on the notional value of the contracts and receive dividends on the underlying shares. These amounts are recognized currently in earnings as they are incurred or received.

We entered into equity forward contracts to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows associated with recognized, employee-directed investments in Darden stock within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.  We did not elect hedge accounting with the expectation that changes in the fair value of the equity forward contracts would offset changes in the fair value of Darden stock investments in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings.  These contracts currently extend through

July 2021

.

The notional and fair values of our derivative contracts are as follows:

(1)

Derivative assets and liabilities are included in receivables, net, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other current liabilities, as applicable, on our consolidated balance sheets.

The effects of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships in the consolidated statements of earnings are as follows:

(1)

Location of the gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI to earnings as well as the gain (loss) recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion of the hedge is restaurant labor expenses and general and administrative expenses.

(2)

Location of the gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI to earnings as well as the gain (loss) recognized in earnings for the ineffective portion of the hedge is interest, net.

The effects of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the consolidated statements of earnings are as follows:

Based on the fair value of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of

May 28, 2017

, we expect to reclassify

$0.2 million

of net gains on derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

during the next 12 months based on the maturity of equity forward contracts.  However, the amounts ultimately realized in earnings will be dependent on the fair value of the contracts on the settlement dates.

NOTE 9 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The fair values of cash equivalents, receivables, net, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate their carrying amounts due to their short duration.

The following tables summarize the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

:

(1)

The fair value of these securities is based on closing market prices of the investments, when applicable, or, alternatively, valuations utilizing market data and other observable inputs, inclusive of the risk of nonperformance.

(2)

The fair value of our U.S. Treasury securities is based on closing market prices.

(3)

The fair value of our equity forwards is based on the closing market value of Darden stock, inclusive of the risk of nonperformance.

Our fixed-income securities are carried at fair value and consist of available-for-sale securities related to insurance funding requirements for our workers’ compensation and general liability claims.  As of

May 28, 2017

, the cost and market value for our securities that qualify as available-for-sale was

$4.2 million

and

$4.1 million

, respectively.  Earnings include insignificant realized gains and loss from sales of available-for-sale securities. At

May 28, 2017

, our available-for-sale securities of

$2.9 million

have maturities of less than one year and

$1.2 million

have maturities within one to three years.

The carrying value and fair value of long-term debt, as of

May 28, 2017

, was

$936.6 million

and

$1.05 billion

, respectively.  The carrying value and fair value of long-term debt as of

May 29, 2016

, was

$440.0 million

and

$499.5 million

, respectively. The


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

fair value of long-term debt, which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, is determined based on market prices or, if market prices are not available, the present value of the underlying cash flows discounted at our incremental borrowing rates.

The fair value of non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, which is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, is determined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets and estimates of future cash flows.  As of

May 28, 2017

, adjustments to the fair values of non-financial assets were not material.  As of

May 29, 2016

, long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of

NOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Share Repurchase Program

On

September 29, 2016

, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to

$500.0 million

NOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES

Total income tax expense was allocated as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the provision for income taxes thereon are as follows:

The following table is a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate from continuing operations included in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings:

As of

May 28, 2017

, we had estimated current prepaid state income taxes of

$6.2 million

which is included on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as prepaid income taxes and estimated current federal income taxes payable of

$1.9 million

, which are included on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as accrued income taxes.

As of

May 28, 2017

, we had unrecognized tax benefits of

$16.4 million

, which represents the aggregate tax effect of the differences between tax return positions and benefits recognized in our consolidated financial statements, all of which would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in our favor. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at

May 28, 2017

, is

$0.7 million

related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of examinations. The

$0.7 million

relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Penalties, when incurred, are recognized in general and administrative expense. Interest expense associated with unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the release of accrued interest related to prior year matters due to settlement or the lapse of the statute of limitations was as follows:

At

May 28, 2017

, we had

$0.9 million

accrued for the payment of interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we participate in the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), whereby our U.S. federal income tax returns are reviewed by the IRS both prior to and after their filing.  Income tax returns are subject to audit by state and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. These returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. The major jurisdictions in which the Company files income tax returns include the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Canada, and all states in the U.S. that have an income tax. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2016, and state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2012.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Net operating loss, credit and charitable contribution carryforwards have the potential to expire. We have taken current and potential future expirations into consideration when evaluating the need for valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which our deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances at

May 28, 2017

.

NOTE 14 - RETIREMENT PLANS

Defined Benefit Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan

We sponsor non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, for a group of certain eligible employees in the United States under which benefits are based on various formulas, including a Final Average Pay formula and a Cash Balance formula. As of December 2014, the plans were frozen and no additional benefits will accrue for participants (except for continuing interest credits for eligible participants in the Cash Balance component). Pension plan assets are invested in U.S. and international equity and fixed-income security funds and a real estate investment fund. Our policy is to fund, at a minimum, the amount necessary on


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We also sponsor a non-contributory postretirement benefit plan that provides health care benefits to our salaried retirees. Fundings related to the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plan, which are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, were as follows:

(1)

Funding for fiscal 2016 includes a voluntary funding contribution of

$25.0 million

.

We expect to contribute approximately

$0.4 million

to our defined benefit pension plans and approximately

$1.3 million

to our postretirement benefit plan during fiscal


.

We are required to recognize the over- or under-funded status of the plans as an asset or liability as measured by the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation and any unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  Additionally, the defined benefit pension plans recognized

$19.9 million

of previously unrecognized loss in net periodic benefit cost due to a settlement charge triggered by lump sum payouts during the fourth quarter of fiscal


.

The following provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plan benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and the funded status of the plans as of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The following is a detail of the balance sheet components of each of our plans and a reconciliation of the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):

The following is a summary of our accumulated and projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit plans:

The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net expense:

(1)

Determined as of the end of fiscal year.

(2)

Determined as of the beginning of fiscal year.

We set the discount rate assumption annually for each of the plans at their valuation dates to reflect the yield of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments, with lives that approximate the maturity of the plan benefits. Additionally, for our mortality assumption as of fiscal year end, we selected the most recent RP-2014 mortality tables and MP-2016 mortality improvement scale to measure the benefit obligations.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon several factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results, an analysis of current market conditions, asset fund allocations and the views of leading financial advisers and economists.  We reduced our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our defined benefit plans from

7.0 percent

used in fiscal


to

6.5 percent

used in fiscal


and we continue to use

6.5 percent

for fiscal


in connection with our current expectations for long-term returns and target asset fund allocation. In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we have evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return projections of the plan assets, which give


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

consideration to the asset mix and the anticipated timing of the pension plan outflows. We employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity and fixed-income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a prudent level of risk. Our historical 10-year, 15-year and 20-year rates of return on plan assets, calculated using the geometric method average of returns, are approximately

6.0 percent

,

8.4 percent

and

8.5 percent

, respectively, as of

May 28, 2017

. Our Benefit Plans Committee has delegated to the Benefit Plans Investment Committee the authority to set the investment policy for the defined benefit plans and oversees the investment allocation, which includes setting long-term strategic targets. Our overall investment strategy is to achieve appropriate diversification through a mix of U.S. and international equity and fixed-income investments and real estate investments. Currently, our target asset fund allocation is

40.0 percent

high-quality, long-duration fixed-income securities,

31.0 percent

U.S. equities,

16.0 percent

international equities,

10.0 percent

absolute-return funds and

3.0 percent

real estate securities. The investment policy establishes a re-balancing band around the established targets within which the asset class weight is allowed to vary. Equity securities, absolute-return funds, international equities and fixed-income securities include investments in various industry sectors. Investments in real estate securities follow different strategies designed to maximize returns, allow for diversification and provide a hedge against inflation. Our current positioning is neutral on investment style between value and growth companies and large and small cap companies. We monitor our actual asset fund allocation to ensure that it approximates our target allocation and believe that our long-term asset fund allocation will continue to approximate our target allocation. Investments held in U.S. fixed income commingled funds, U.S. commingled funds, an international commingled fund, a global fixed-income commingled fund and emerging markets equity investments represented approximately

39.6 percent

,

30.7 percent

,

11.0 percent

,

9.9 percent

and

5.6 percent

, respectively, of total plan assets and represents the only significant concentrations of risk related to a single entity, sector, country, commodity or investment fund. No other single sector concentration of assets exceeded

5.0 percent

of total plan assets.

Components of net periodic benefit cost included in earnings are as follows:

The amortization of the net actuarial gain (loss) component of our fiscal


net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit plans and postretirement benefit plan is expected to be approximately

$(2.8) million

and

$3.0 million

, respectively.

The fair values of the defined benefit pension plans assets at their measurement dates of

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, are as follows:


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(1)

U.S. commingled funds are comprised of investments in funds that purchase publicly traded U.S. common stock for total return purposes. Investments are valued using a unit price or net asset value (NAV) based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the funds. There are no redemption restrictions associated with these funds.

(2)

International commingled fund is comprised of investments in funds that purchase publicly traded non-U.S. common stock for total return purposes. Investments are valued using a unit price or NAV based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the fund. There are no redemption restrictions associated with this fund.

(3)

Emerging market commingled fund and developed market securities are comprised of investments in funds that purchase publicly traded common stock of non-U.S. companies in emerging economies for total return purposes. Funds are valued using a unit price or NAV based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the funds. There are no redemption restrictions associated with these funds.


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Emerging market mutual fund is comprised of securities associated with emerging markets and frontier markets. Fund is valued using quoted market prices from national exchanges.

(5)

Real estate commingled fund is comprised of investments in funds that purchase publicly traded common stock of real estate companies for purposes of total return. These investments are valued using a unit price or NAV based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the fund. There are no redemption restrictions associated with this fund.

(6)

Fixed-income securities are comprised of investments in government and corporate debt securities. These securities are valued by the trustee at closing prices from national exchanges or pricing vendors on the valuation date.

(7)

Global fixed-income commingled fund is comprised of investments in U.S. and non-U.S. government fixed-income securities. Investments are valued using a unit price or NAV based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the fund. There are no redemption restrictions associated with this fund.

(8)

U.S. fixed-income commingled funds are comprised of a diversified portfolio of U.S. investment-grade corporate and government securities. Investments are valued using a unit price or NAV based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the funds. There are no redemption restrictions associated with these funds.

The following benefit payments are expected to be paid between fiscal


and fiscal


:

Postemployment Severance Practice

We accrue for postemployment severance costs in our consolidated financial statements and recognize actuarial gains and losses as well as prior service credits related to our postemployment severance accrual as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). As of

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

,

$0.1 million

and

$4.3 million

, respectively, of unrecognized actuarial losses related to our postemployment severance practice were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on a net of tax basis.

Defined Contribution Plan

We have a defined contribution (401(k)) plan (Darden Savings Plan) covering most employees age


and older. We match contributions for participants with at least

one

year of service up to

6 percent

of compensation, based on our performance. The match ranges from a minimum of

$0.25

to

$1.20

for each dollar contributed by the participant. The plan also provides for a profit sharing contribution for eligible participants equal to

1.5 percent

of the participant’s compensation. The plan had net assets of

$753.7 million

at

May 28, 2017

, and

$643.3 million

at

May 29, 2016

. Expense recognized in fiscal


,


and


was

$3.7 million

,

$15.1 million

and

$0.6 million

, respectively. Employees classified as “highly compensated” under the IRC are not eligible to participate in this plan. Instead, highly compensated employees are eligible to participate in a separate non-qualified deferred compensation (FlexComp) plan. This plan allows eligible employees to defer the payment of part of their annual salary and all or part of their annual bonus and provides for awards that approximate the matching contributions and other amounts that participants would have received had they been eligible to participate in our defined contribution and defined benefit plans. Amounts payable to highly compensated employees under the FlexComp plan totaled

$210.3 million

and

$194.0 million

at

May 28, 2017

and

May 29, 2016

, respectively. These amounts are included in other current liabilities on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The defined contribution plan includes a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). The ESOP borrowed

$16.9 million

from us at a variable rate of interest in July 1996.  At

May 28, 2017

, the ESOP’s original debt to us had a balance of

$1.4 million

with a variable rate of interest of

0.99 percent

and is due to be repaid no later than

December 2019

.  At the end of fiscal 2005, the ESOP borrowed an additional

$1.6 million

(Additional Loan) from us at a variable interest rate and acquired an additional

0.05 million

shares of our common stock, which were held in suspense within the ESOP at that time.  At

May 28, 2017

, the Additional Loan had a balance of

$1.1 million

with a variable interest rate of

1.16 percent

and is due to be repaid no later than December 2018.  Compensation expense is recognized as contributions are accrued.  Fluctuations in our stock price impact the amount of expense to be recognized. Contributions to the plan, plus the dividends accumulated on unallocated shares held by the ESOP, are used to pay principal, interest and expenses of the plan. As loan payments are made, common stock is allocated to ESOP participants. In each of the fiscal years

million

and

$1.1 million

, respectively, and contributions received from us of

$0.1 million

,

$0.1 million

and

$0.0 million

, respectively, to pay principal and interest on our debt.

ESOP shares are included in weighted-average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating net earnings per share with the exception of those shares acquired under the Additional Loan, which are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 718-40, Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Fluctuations in our stock price are recognized as adjustments to common stock and surplus when the shares are committed to be released. The ESOP shares acquired under the Additional Loan are not considered outstanding until they are committed to be released and, therefore, unreleased shares have been excluded for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net earnings per share. As of

May 28, 2017

, the ESOP shares included in the basic and diluted net earnings per share calculation totaled

2.3 million

shares, representing

2.0 million

allocated shares and

0.3 million

suspense shares.

NOTE 15 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

In September 2015, our shareholders approved the Darden Restaurants, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2015 Plan). All equity grants subject to ASC Topic 718 after the date of approval are made under the 2015 Plan.  No further equity grants after that date are permitted under the Darden Restaurants, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, the RARE Hospitality International, Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan or any other prior stock option and/or stock grant plans (collectively, the Prior Plans). The 2015 Plan and the Prior Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The 2015 Plan provides for the issuance of up to

7.6 million

common shares in connection with the granting of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock awards and other stock-based awards including performance stock units and Darden stock units to employees, consultants and non-employee directors. There are outstanding awards under the Prior Plans that may still vest and be exercised in accordance with their terms. As of

May 28, 2017

, approximately

3.7 million

shares may be issued under outstanding awards that were granted under the Prior Plans.

Stock-based compensation expense included in continuing operations was as follows:

(1)

The higher expense in fiscal


is primarily attributable to the workforce reduction efforts and a change in mix of equity awards granted.

Beginning in fiscal 2016, cash-settled performance awards were replaced with two new types of equity-settled performance-based restricted stock units, where

0.0 percent

to

150.0 percent

of the entire grant is earned or forfeited at the end of the respective vesting periods, which range from

three

to

years. The number of units that actually vest will be determined based on the achievement of performance criteria set forth in the award agreements and may range from

0.0 percent

to

150.0 percent

of target. A portion of these performance awards, which will vest based on the achievement of company-specific targets, are measured based on a value equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, and amortized over the service period. The other portion of these awards, which will vest based on the achievement of market-based targets, are measured based on estimated fair value as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, and amortized over the service period. As of

May 28, 2017

, there was

$12.6 million

of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested equity-settled performance stock units granted under our stock plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
