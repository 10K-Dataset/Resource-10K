Item 1.  BUSINESS

Introduction

     Darden  Restaurants,  Inc.  is the  largest  publicly  held  casual  dining
restaurant  company  in the  world.*  As of May  26,  2002,  we  operated  1,211
restaurants in the United States and Canada.  In the United States,  we operated
1,174  restaurants in 49 states (the exception being Alaska),  including 636 Red
Lobster(R), 490 Olive Garden(R), 29 Bahama Breeze(R), and 19 Smokey Bones(R) BBQ
Sports Bar restaurants. In Canada, we operated 37 restaurants,  including 31 Red
Lobster and six Olive Garden  restaurants.  We operate all of our restaurants in
the United States and Canada, with no franchising.  In Japan, we licensed 33 Red
Lobster  restaurants to an unaffiliated  Japanese  corporation that operates the
restaurants under an Area Development and Franchise Agreement.

     Darden is a Florida  corporation  incorporated  in March  1995,  and is the
parent company of GMRI,  Inc.,  also a Florida  corporation.  GMRI and our other
subsidiaries own the operating  assets of the  restaurants.  GMRI was originally
incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc.

     Our principal  executive offices and restaurant  support center are located
at 5900 Lake Ellenor Drive,  Orlando,  Florida 32809,  telephone (407) 245-4000.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to Darden, "we", "our" or
"us" include Darden, GMRI and our respective subsidiaries.

Background

     We opened our first  restaurant,  a Red Lobster,  in  Lakeland,  Florida in
1968.  Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden,  for whom we are named.  We
were acquired by General Mills,  Inc. in 1970. In May 1995, we became a separate
publicly  held company when General Mills  distributed  all  outstanding  Darden
stock to General Mills' stockholders.

     In recent years our two largest restaurant  concepts have resumed growth in
the  number  of  restaurants.  The  number  of  Red  Lobster  and  Olive  Garden
restaurants   open  at  the  end  of  fiscal  2002  increased  by  six  and  19,
respectively,  as compared to the end of fiscal 2001. Red Lobster has grown from
six  restaurants  in  operation  at the end of fiscal 1970 to 667 units in North
America  by the end of  fiscal  2002.  Olive  Garden,  an  internally  developed
concept,  opened its first  restaurant in fiscal 1983,  and by the end of fiscal
2002 had expanded to 496 restaurants and one food court cafe in North America.

     Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept with a Caribbean theme. In
fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando,  Florida.  At
the end of fiscal 2002, there were 29 Bahama Breeze restaurants.

     Our newest restaurant concept is Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar, an internally
developed  concept.  The first  restaurant was opened in fiscal 2000 in Orlando,
Florida. At the end of fiscal 2002, there were 19 Smokey Bones restaurants.

     The table on the  following  page  shows our growth and lists the number of
restaurants  operated by Red Lobster,  Olive  Garden,  Bahama  Breeze and Smokey
Bones as of the end of each  fiscal  year since  1970.  The final  column in the
table lists our total sales for the years indicated.

Strategy

     The  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments: quick service,  midscale,  casual dining and fine dining. The industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains.
We  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multi-unit  concepts  have the
opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment.  We plan to
grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts
and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded
profitably.

     While we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment,  we know we cannot be
successful  without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is "To nourish
and  delight  everyone we serve."  This core  purpose is  supported  by our core
values:

         o    Integrity and fairness;
         o    Respect and caring;
         o    Diversity;
         o    Always learning/always teaching;
         o    Being "of service";
         o    Teamwork; and
         o    Excellence.

     To support our core  purpose,  we have  established  a  framework  of three
strategic imperatives or "building blocks":

         o   leadership development as a core competency;
         o   service and hospitality excellence; and
         o   culinary and beverage excellence.

     We support these  strategic  imperatives  by developing  two key enablers -
diversity  literacy and technology  literacy - throughout the  organization.  We
believe that our continuing focus on these three building  blocks,  supported by
our  commitment to diversity and  technology,  provides a strong  foundation for
future growth.

Restaurant Concepts

Red Lobster

     Red  Lobster is the largest  casual  dining,  seafood-specialty  restaurant
operator in the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish,
shrimp,  crab, lobster,  scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere.  The
menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and non-seafood entrees, appetizers
and desserts.

     Dinner  entree  prices  range  from  $8.99 to  $24.99,  with fresh fish and
certain lobster items available at market price.  Lunch entree prices range from
$5.25 to $9.99.  The entree  price also  includes  side items and our  signature
Cheddar Bay  biscuits.  During  fiscal  2002,  the average  check per person was
between $15.50 and $16.50,  with alcoholic  beverages  accounting for about nine
percent  of  Red  Lobster's  sales.  Red  Lobster  maintains  approximately  128
different  menus to reflect  geographic  differences  in  consumer  preferences,
prices and selections in its trade areas,  as well as a lower-priced  children's
menu.

     Fiscal 2002 was a record  year in both sales and  profits for Red  Lobster.
Total sales of $2.34  billion  for the 2002  fiscal year were 7.1 percent  above
last year and  average  sales per  restaurant  for the year were $3.5  million -
record levels for Red Lobster. Operating profit for the fiscal year increased at
a double-digit  percentage rate and established a new record for Red Lobster. As
of the end of fiscal 2002,  Red Lobster had enjoyed 18  consecutive  quarters of
U.S. same-restaurant sales increases.





Olive Garden

     Olive  Garden is the  market  share  leader  among  casual  dining  Italian
restaurants  in the United  States.  Olive  Garden's  menu includes a variety of
authentic Italian foods featuring fresh  ingredients,  and an expanded wine list
that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy.  The menu includes
antipasti  (appetizers);  soups,  salad and garlic  breadsticks;  baked  pastas;
sauteed specialties with chicken,  seafood and fresh vegetables;  grilled meats;
and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for
its espresso and cappuccino.

     Dinner  entree  prices  range from $7.50 to $17.95,  and most lunch  entree
prices range from $5.75 to $8.95. The price of each entree also includes as much
fresh salad or soup as a guest  desires.  During fiscal 2002,  the average check
per person was $12.50 to $13.50, with alcoholic  beverages  accounting for about
nine percent of Olive Garden's sales.  Olive Garden  maintains  approximately 24
different dinner menus and 23 lunch menus to reflect  geographic  differences in
consumer  preferences,  prices and selections in its trade areas, as well as two
different lower-priced children's menus.

     Fiscal 2002 was a record  year for both sales and profits at Olive  Garden.
Olive Garden's  total sales for the 2002 fiscal year were $1.86 billion,  up 9.5
percent  from the prior  year,  and its  annual  average  sales  per  restaurant
increased to $3.9 million - both record levels.  Olive Garden had a double-digit
percentage increase in operating profit for the seventh consecutive fiscal year,
reaching  a new high in  operating  profit  as  well.  Olive  Garden  has had 31
consecutive  quarters of U.S.  same-restaurant  sales increases as of the end of
fiscal 2002.

Bahama Breeze

     Bahama  Breeze  is a  Caribbean-themed  restaurant  that  offers  guests  a
distinctive island dining experience. The first Bahama Breeze opened in 1996 and
met with strong positive consumer response.  We continued to test the concept by
opening a limited  number of  additional  restaurants  in each of the  following
years,  and began  national  expansion  of the concept in 1998.  In fiscal 2002,
sales  at  Bahama  Breeze  surpassed  $125  million  and  we  opened  eight  new
restaurants  in five new  markets,  bringing the total to 29  restaurants  in 20
markets.  The concept continues to be well received by guests, with strong sales
volumes.  We plan to open six to ten new  Bahama  Breeze  restaurants  in fiscal
2003.

Smokey Bones

     Our newest casual  dining  concept,  Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar,  combines
barbeque with a relaxed sports bar atmosphere.  We opened the first Smokey Bones
in September  1999, and began national  expansion of the concept in fiscal 2002.
There are  currently 19 Smokey Bones  restaurants,  and we plan to open 20 to 25
new Smokey Bones  restaurants  in fiscal 2003.  We believe that Smokey Bones has
strong  expansion  potential and could become at least a $1.5 billion  operating
concept in the future.

Recent and Planned Growth

     During fiscal 2002, we opened 49 new restaurants  (excluding the relocation
of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at
existing sites) and closed seven restaurants. This resulted in a net increase of
42 restaurants in operation (or 43, including relocations,  which net each other
out,  and  rebuilds).  We plan to open  approximately  54 to 72 new Red Lobster,
Olive  Garden,  Bahama  Breeze and Smokey Bones  restaurants  during fiscal 2003
(excluding  relocations and rebuilds).  Our actual and projected new openings by
concept (excluding relocations and rebuilds ) are shown below.




     Our objective is to continue to expand our current  portfolio of restaurant
concepts,  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded
profitably.  We are  currently  testing new ideas and  concepts,  and  expanding
Bahama  Breeze  and  Smokey  Bones  nationally  in light of  favorable  consumer
response. We also regularly evaluate potential acquisition  candidates to assess
whether they would satisfy our strategic and financial  objectives.  At present,
we have not identified any specific acquisitions.

     We will continue to focus on improving  operational returns at Olive Garden
and Red Lobster,  and will limit new  restaurant  expansion of those concepts to
the highest-potential  sites. Olive Garden's expansion will include its recently
developed "Tuscan  Farmhouse"  design,  an outgrowth of our  collaboration  with
Rocca delle Macie, a  family-owned  winery in Tuscany.  In addition,  we plan to
expand  Bahama  Breeze  and  Smokey  Bones at a pace that will  enable  each new
restaurant  to capture the  concept's  full  potential.  The specific  number of
openings will depend on many factors,  such as our ability to locate appropriate
sites,  negotiate  acceptable  purchase or lease terms,  obtain  necessary local
governmental  permits,  complete  construction  and recruit and train restaurant
management and hourly personnel.

     We consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant's
long-term  success,  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection
process.  Prior to entering a market,  we conduct a thorough  study to determine
the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants.  Our site  selection  process
incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors.  These
factors include trade area  demographics,  such as target population density and
household  income levels;  competitive  influences in the trade area; the site's
visibility,  accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers
such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members
of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to
its acquisition.  Constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120
to 180 days after the site is acquired and permits are obtained.

     The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment,
size and dining  capacity of the 11 Red Lobster and 20 Olive Garden  restaurants
that were  opened  during  fiscal  2002  (excluding  relocations,  rebuilds  and
conversion of existing restaurants).


     We systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that
each meets our standards.  When a restaurant falls below minimum  standards,  we
conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and
operational plans to improve that restaurant's performance.  If performance does
not improve to acceptable  levels,  the restaurant is evaluated for  relocation,
closing or conversion to one of our other concepts.

     During fiscal 2002, we permanently  closed five,  rebuilt one and relocated
six Red Lobster restaurants in the United States, and closed one Red
Lobster restaurant in Canada. During the same period, we permanently closed one
and relocated one Olive Garden restaurant in the United States, and none in
Canada.

Restaurant Operations

     We believe  that  high-quality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our
long-term  success.  We  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position,  strong
success-oriented   culture  and  various  short-term  and  long-term   incentive
programs,  including stock options and restricted stock, help attract and retain
highly motivated restaurant managers.




     Our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size.
Each restaurant is led by a general manager and one to four additional managers,
depending on the operating  complexity and sales volume of the restaurant.  Each
restaurant also employs  approximately 65 to 140 hourly employees,  most of whom
work part-time.  We issue detailed  operations  manuals  covering all aspects of
restaurant  operations,  as well as food and beverage  manuals  which detail the
preparation  procedures of our formulated  recipes.  The  restaurant  management
teams are  responsible  for the day-to-day  operation of each restaurant and for
ensuring compliance with our operating  standards.  At our two largest concepts,
Red Lobster and Olive Garden,  restaurant  general managers report to directors,
and each director is responsible  for seven to 14  restaurants.  Restaurants are
visited  regularly by all levels of supervision to help ensure strict  adherence
to all aspects of our standards.

     Each concept's vice president or director of training, together with senior
operations  executives,  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that
concept's  operations  training programs.  These efforts include a 12-to 15-week
training program for management  trainees,  and continuing  development programs
for  managers,  supervisors  and  directors.  The  emphasis of the  training and
development  programs  varies by restaurant  concept,  but includes  leadership,
restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills.  We also  use a  highly
structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants,  including  deploying
training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations.  The opening
training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the
new  restaurant  one  week  following  the  opening.   They  are  redeployed  as
appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant's operating staff.

Quality Assurance

     Our Quality Assurance  Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide
high-quality  food in a clean and safe  environment.  Through rigorous  physical
evaluation  and testing at our North  American  laboratories  and through "Point
Source  Inspection" in southeastern  Asia, we seek to purchase only seafood that
meets  or  exceeds  our  specifications.   Since  1976,  we  have  maintained  a
microbiological  laboratory to routinely test seafood and other  commodities for
quality and  microbiological  safety. In addition,  quality  assurance  managers
visit each restaurant  periodically  throughout the year to review food handling
and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation. The quality
assurance  managers  also serve as a liaison to  regulatory  agencies  on issues
relating to food safety.  We use independent third party auditors to inspect and
evaluate  commodity  vendors.  In this  manner,  we attempt  to ensure  that our
suppliers   maintain   good   manufacturing   practices  and  operate  with  the
comprehensive industry standard Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points programs
in place.

Purchasing and Distribution

     Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies
at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement
from reliable  sources.  Our purchasing staff sources,  negotiates and purchases
food and supplies from more than 2,500 suppliers in 45 countries. Suppliers must
meet strict quality control  standards in the  development,  harvest,  catch and
production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term
vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage  availability  and cost of
products.

     We believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant
competitive advantage.  Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United
States and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  top-quality
seafood at competitive  prices.  We believe that we have  established  excellent
long-term  relationships  with key seafood vendors,  and source product directly
from producers (not brokers or middlemen)  predominantly and whenever  possible.
We operate a procurement  office in Singapore to source  products  directly from
Asia.  While the supply of certain seafood species is volatile,  we believe that
we have the ability to identify  alternative  seafood products and to adjust our
menus as necessary.  All other essential food products are available,  or can be
made available upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers.  Because
of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the
restaurants  have a modest  aggregate  dollar  value in  relation  to  revenues.
Controlled  inventories of specified products are distributed to all restaurants
through national distribution companies.

Advertising and Marketing

     We believe that we have  developed  significant  marketing and  advertising
capabilities.  Our size  enables  us to be a dominant  advertiser  in the casual
dining  segment of the  restaurant  industry.  We  leverage  the  efficiency  of



national  network  television  advertising  and  supplement it with local market
television advertising.  Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers
and we use advertising and product promotions to attract customers. We implement
periodic  promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain  and  increase  our sales and
profits. We also rely on radio and newspaper  advertising,  as well as newspaper
and direct mail couponing  programs,  as appropriate,  to attract customers.  We
have developed and consistently use sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research
techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.

Employees

     At the end of fiscal 2002, we employed  approximately  133,200 persons.  Of
these employees, approximately 1,300 were corporate or concept personnel located
in our restaurant support center in Orlando,  Florida,  approximately 5,800 were
restaurant  management personnel in the restaurants or in field offices, and the
remainder were hourly  restaurant  personnel.  Of the restaurant  support center
employees,  approximately  58% were  management  personnel  and the balance were
administrative or office employees.  Our operating executives have an average of
more  than 14 years of  experience  with us.  The  restaurant  general  managers
average 11 years with us. We believe  that we  provide  working  conditions  and
compensation  that  compare  favorably  with  those  of  our  competitors.  Most
employees,  other than restaurant management and corporate management,  are paid
on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Management Information Systems

     We strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as
a competitive  advantage.  Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have
been used to assist in the management of the  restaurants.  We have  implemented
systems targeted at improved financial control, cost management,  enhanced guest
service and improved employee effectiveness.  Management information systems are
designed to be used across restaurant concepts,  yet are flexible enough to meet
the unique needs of each restaurant concept.  During fiscal 2002, we implemented
a  suite  of  web-enabled  financial  systems  and  a  high-speed  data  network
connecting  all  restaurants  to all  current  and future  applications.  We are
currently  completing an upgrade of our human  resource  (including  payroll and
benefits) systems using web-enabled and fully integrated application suites.

     Restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from
the restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a
day. A communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and
from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night,  providing  timely  and
extensive  information on business  activity in every  location.  The restaurant
support center houses our data center, which contains sufficient computing power
to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently.  Our
information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual
data  and the  physical  assets.  We  guard  against  business  interruption  by
maintaining a disaster  recovery plan, which includes storing critical  business
information off-site,  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hot-site facility
and  providing  on-site  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator.  We use
internally developed proprietary  software, as well as purchased software,  with
proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed
effectively to each of our restaurants.

     Our  management  believes its current  systems and the  upgrades  currently
underway will position us well to support  current needs and future  growth.  We
are committed to  maintaining  an industry  leadership  position in  information
systems  and  computing  technology.  We  use a  strategic  information  systems
planning  process that involves  senior  management  and is integrated  into our
overall business  planning.  Information  systems projects are prioritized based
upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.

Competition

     The  restaurant  industry is  intensely  competitive  with  respect to food
quality,  price,  service,  restaurant  location,  concept,   attractiveness  of
facilities,  and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and  marketing  programs.  The
restaurant  business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes;  national,
regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the
type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers' discretionary
purchasing  power.  We compete  within each market with  national  and  regional
chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only for customers but also for
management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. Restaurants also
face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers "convenient



meals" in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section. We
expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.

     Other factors  pertaining to our  competitive  position in the industry are
addressed under the sections entitled "Forward-Looking  Statements," "Purchasing
and  Distribution,"  "Advertising  and Marketing,"  and "Management  Information
Systems," elsewhere in this report.

Trademarks and Related Agreements

     We regard our  Darden  Restaurants(R),  Red  Lobster(R),  Olive  Garden(R),
Bahama  Breeze(R) and Smokey  Bones(R) BBQ Sports Bar service  marks,  and other
variations  of these service  marks,  as having  significant  value and as being
important in marketing the restaurants.  Our policy is to pursue registration of
our  important  service  marks and  trademarks  whenever  possible and to oppose
vigorously any infringement of them.

     Our only restaurant  operations outside of North America  historically have
been  conducted  through an Area  Development  and Franchise  Agreement with Red
Lobster  Japan  Co.,  Ltd.  (Red  Lobster  Japan),   an  unaffiliated   Japanese
corporation. In December 2001, the parent company of Red Lobster Japan agreed to
sell all the  shares  of Red  Lobster  Japan to  another  Japanese  corporation,
subject to our approval.  In February  2002, we entered into an amendment to the
Franchise Agreement to provide our approval,  and to make certain  modifications
to the  terms of the  agreement.  Red  Lobster  Japan  operated  33 Red  Lobster
restaurants in Japan as of May 26, 2002. We do not have an ownership interest in
Red Lobster Japan, but receive royalty income under the Franchise Agreement. The
amount of this income is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Seasonality

     Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.  During fiscal years 2002, 2001 and
2000,  our sales were highest in the spring,  lowest in the fall, and comparable
during  winter  and  summer.  Holidays,   severe  weather,  storms  and  similar
conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.

Government Regulation

     We are  subject to various  federal,  state and local  laws  affecting  our
business.  Each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and
regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which  include  health,
safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is
located.  The development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and
acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use,  environmental,
traffic and other regulations.  To date, we have not been significantly affected
by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

     Presently  about nine percent of our sales are  attributable to the sale of
alcoholic beverages.  Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each
site (in most  cases,  on an annual  basis),  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or
suspended  for cause at any time.  These  regulations  relate to many aspects of
restaurant operation,  including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours
of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling,
and storage and dispensing of alcoholic  beverages.  The failure of a restaurant
to obtain or retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect the  restaurant's
operations. We also are subject in certain states to "dram-shop" statutes, which
generally  provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment  that
wrongfully serves alcoholic  beverages to an intoxicated person, who then causes
injury. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive  general
liability insurance.

     We also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws
governing  such matters as overtime,  tip credits,  working  conditions,  safety
standards,  and hiring and  employment  practices.  Changes in these laws during
fiscal 2002 have not had a material effect on our operations.

     We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment ("TRAC")
agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  Through increased  educational and
other efforts in the restaurants,  the TRAC agreement  reduces the likelihood of
potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.




     We are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations,  but these
rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations.  During  fiscal  2002,
there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
and no such expenditures are anticipated.

     Our  facilities  must  comply  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  the
Americans  With  Disabilities  Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related  state  statutes.
Under  the  ADA  and  related  state  laws,  when  constructing  or  undertaking
significant  remodeling  of our  restaurants,  we must make  them  more  readily
accessible to disabled  persons,  to better provide service to disabled persons,
or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of disabled persons.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain  information  included in this report and other materials filed or to be
filed by us with the  Commission  (as well as  information  included  in oral or
written  statements  made by us or on our behalf),  may contain  forward-looking
statements about our future performance, plans and objectives,  long-term goals,
forecasts of market trends and other matters.  These statements may be contained
in our  filings  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  in our  press
releases,  in other written  communications,  and in oral  statements made by or
with the approval of one of our  authorized  officers.  Words or phrases such as
"believe,"  "plan," "will likely result,"  "expect,"  "intend," "will continue,"
"is anticipated,"  "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements.  These statements, and any other statements
that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as codified in Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934,  as  amended  from  time to time  (the  "Act").  These  forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, projections regarding: casual dining
sales  growth;  the  ability of the casual  dining  segment to weather  economic
downturns;   demographic  trends;  our  expansion  plans,  business  development
activities and future sales  expectations;  and our long-term goal of increasing
market share.

     In connection  with the "safe harbor"  provisions of the Act, we are filing
the following  cautionary  statements to identify important  factors,  risks and
uncertainties  that could  cause our actual  results to differ  materially  from
those  projected  in  forward-looking  statements  made by us, or on our behalf.
These cautionary statements are to be used as a reference in connection with any
forward-looking  statements.  The factors, risks and uncertainties identified in
these  cautionary  statements  are in addition to those  contained  in any other
cautionary statements, written or oral, which may be made or otherwise addressed
in  connection  with a  forward-looking  statement  or  contained  in any of our
subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of these
factors,  risks and uncertainties,  we caution against placing undue reliance on
forward-looking statements.  Although we believe that the assumptions underlying
its forward-looking  statements are reasonable,  any of the assumptions could be
incorrect,  and there can be no assurance  that the  forward-looking  statements
will prove to be accurate.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
on which they are made. We do not  undertake any  obligation to modify or revise
any  forward-looking  statement  to  take  into  account  or  otherwise  reflect
subsequent   events,   or   circumstances   arising  after  the  date  that  the
forward-looking statement was made.

     The following  factors,  risks and  uncertainties,  have affected,  and may
continue to affect,  our operating  results and the environment  within which we
conduct our  business.  If our  projections  and estimates  regarding  these key
factors differ  materially from what actually  occurs,  our actual results could
vary  significantly  from  the  performance  projected  in  its  forward-looking
statements.

     Competition.  The  casual  dining  sector  of the  restaurant  industry  is
intensely competitive in pricing,  service,  location,  personnel,  and type and
quality of food.  We compete with  national,  regional  and local  organizations
primarily  through the quality,  variety and value perception of menu items. The
number  and  location  of  restaurants,   quality  and  efficiency  of  service,
attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and marketing
programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will
continue in all of these areas.




     Economic,  Market and Other  Conditions.  The casual  dining  sector of the
restaurant  industry  is  affected by changes in  national,  regional  and local
economic  conditions;  the  seasonality of our business;  consumer  preferences,
including changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer acceptance of our
restaurant concepts;  consumer spending patterns;  demographic trends;  consumer
perceptions  of food  safety,  that could be  negatively  impacted by  publicity
concerning  food-borne  illnesses;   employee  availability;   weather;  traffic
patterns;  and the type, number and location of competing  restaurants.  Factors
such as inflation,  food costs,  labor and benefit costs,  legal claims, and the
availability  of  management  and  hourly   employees  also  affect   restaurant
operations and administrative  expenses. Our ability to undertake new restaurant
development,  as well as improvements and additions to existing restaurants,  is
affected  by economic  conditions,  including  interest  rates,  and  government
policies  impacting land and construction costs and the cost and availability of
borrowed funds.

     Changes in Food Costs and Other Costs.  Our  profitability is significantly
dependent on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the cost of food,
labor,  advertising and media, employee benefits and similar costs over which we
have little control.  The price and  availability of commodities,  including but
not limited to items such as shrimp,  lobster and dairy products, are subject to
fluctuation  and could increase or decrease more than we expect.  We are subject
to the general risk of inflation,  and possible  shortages or  interruptions  in
supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions that could adversely affect
the  availability  and cost of these  and  other  items we buy.  There can be no
assurance  that  management  will be able to  anticipate  and react to increased
costs without a material adverse effect on profitability.

     Importance of Locations.  The success of our  restaurants  depends in large
part on location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue
to  be  attractive,   as  demographic  patterns  change.  Possible  declines  in
neighborhoods where restaurants are located, or economic conditions  surrounding
those neighborhoods, could result in reduced sales in those locations.

     Government  Regulation.  We are subject to various federal, state and local
laws affecting our business. The development and operation of restaurants depend
to a  significant  extent on the selection and  acquisition  of suitable  sites,
which  are  subject  to  zoning,  land  use,  environmental,  traffic  and other
regulations.  Restaurant operations are also subject to licensing and regulation
by state and local departments relating to health,  liquor licenses,  sanitation
and safety standards, federal and state labor laws (including applicable minimum
wage  requirements,  overtime,  working and safety  conditions,  and citizenship
requirements),  federal and state laws which prohibit  discrimination  and other
laws  regulating the design and operation of  facilities,  such as the Americans
With Disabilities Act of 1990. We cannot predict the effect on our operations of
these laws and  regulations  or the future  enactment of additional  legislation
regulating these and other areas.

     Growth Plans. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our
growth objectives or that new restaurants opened or acquired will be profitable.
The opening and success of restaurants depends on various factors, including the
identification  and availability of suitable and economically  viable locations;
sales levels at existing  restaurants;  the  negotiation of acceptable  lease or
purchase terms for new locations;  obtaining all required  governmental permits,
including  zoning  approvals  and  liquor  licenses,  on a timely  basis;  other
regulatory   compliance;   the   availability   of   necessary   contracts   and
subcontractors  and the ability to meet construction  schedules;  our ability to
manage union activities such as picketing,  which could delay construction;  the
availability  of capital at affordable  cost to finance  growth;  changes in the
weather  or other  acts of God that  could  result in  construction  delays  and
adversely  affect the results of one or more  restaurants  for an  indeterminate
amount of time; our ability to hire and train  qualified  management  personnel;
and general economic and business conditions.




Item 2.  PROPERTIES

     As of May 26,  2002,  we  operated  1,211  restaurants  (including  667 Red
Lobster, 496 Olive Garden, 29 Bahama Breeze and 19 Smokey Bones restaurants) and
one Olive Garden Cafe in the following locations:


         Of our 1,211 restaurants and the one Olive Garden Cafe open on May 26,
2002, 777 were located on owned sites and 435 were located on leased sites. The
435 leases are classified as follows:


     During fiscal 1999, we formed two  subsidiary  corporations,  each of which
elected to be taxed as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust  ("REIT") under Sections
856  through  860 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  These  elections  limit  the
activities  of both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets.  The
formation of these two REITs is designed  primarily to assist us in managing our
real  estate  portfolio  and  possibly  to provide a vehicle  to access  capital
markets in the future.

     Both REITs are  non-public  REITs.  Through our  subsidiary  companies,  we
indirectly  own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of
the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting  purposes,  both REITs are
included in our consolidated group.

     We own our executive  offices,  culinary center and training  facilities in
Orlando,  Florida.  Except in limited instances,  our restaurant sites and other
facilities are not subject to mortgages or encumbrances  securing money borrowed
by us from outside sources. In the opinion of our management,  all buildings and
equipment are in good  condition,  suitable for their  purposes and adequate for
our current and foreseeable needs.

     See also Note 4 "Land,  Buildings  and  Equipment"  and Note 11 "Leases" of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 33 and 37, respectively,  of
the  Company's  2002  Annual  Report  to  Shareholders,  incorporated  herein by
reference.

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, we are made a party to legal proceedings  arising in the
ordinary  course of business.  We do not believe that the results of these legal
proceedings, even if unfavorable to us, will have a materially adverse impact on
our financial  position,  results of  operations or cash flows.  See the section
entitled "Government  Regulation" for a discussion of various federal, state and
local regulatory matters.
