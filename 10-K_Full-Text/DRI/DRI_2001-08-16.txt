Item 1.  BUSINESS

Introduction

     Darden  Restaurants,  Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Darden")
is the largest  publicly  held Casual  Dining  restaurant  company in the United
States.* As of May 27, 2001, the Company operated 1,131 restaurants in 49 states
(the exception being Alaska), including 629 Red Lobster(R), 472 Olive Garden(R),
21 Bahama  Breeze(R),  and nine Smokey Bones(R) BBQ Sports Bar  restaurants.  In
addition,  the  Company  operated 37  restaurants  in Canada,  including  32 Red
Lobster and five Olive Garden  restaurants.  The Company also operated one Olive
Garden Cafe(R) in the United States as of May 27, 2001. The Company operates all
of its North  American  restaurants.  In Japan,  as of May 27, 2001, Red Lobster
Japan Partners,  a Japanese retailer  unaffiliated with Darden,  operated 34 Red
Lobster restaurants pursuant to an Area Development and Franchise Agreement.

     The  Company,  a Florida  corporation  incorporated  in March 1995,  is the
parent company of GMRI,  Inc., a Florida  corporation  ("GMRI").  GMRI and other
Darden  subsidiaries  own the  operating  assets  of the  restaurants.  GMRI was
originally incorporated on March 27, 1968, as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc.

     The Company's principal executive offices and restaurant support center are
located at 5900 Lake Ellenor  Drive,  Orlando,  Florida 32809,  telephone  (407)
245-4000.  Unless the context indicates  otherwise,  all references to Darden or
the Company include Darden, GMRI and their respective subsidiaries.

Background

     The  Company  opened its first  restaurant,  a Red  Lobster,  in  Lakeland,
Florida in 1968.  Red  Lobster was  founded by William B.  Darden,  for whom the
Company is named.  The Company was  acquired by General  Mills,  Inc.  ("General
Mills")  in 1970.  In May 1995,  the  Company  became a separate  publicly  held
company when General Mills  distributed all outstanding  Darden stock to General
Mills's stockholders (the "Distribution").

     Following a period during which the Company focused on market  optimization
and the closing of under-performing  units, the Company's two largest restaurant
chains have recently resumed growth in the number of restaurants.  The number of
Red Lobster and Olive Garden  restaurants open at fiscal year end 2001 increased
by seven and eight,  respectively,  as  compared  to fiscal  year end 2000.  Red
Lobster  has grown from six  restaurants  in  operation  in 1970 to 661 units in
North America by the end of fiscal 2001. Olive Garden,  an internally  developed
concept,  opened its first restaurant in 1982, and by the end of fiscal 2001 had
expanded to 477 restaurants and one food court cafe in North America.

     Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept with a Caribbean theme. In
1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando,  Florida. At the end
of fiscal 2001, there were 21 Bahama Breeze restaurants.

     The  Company's  newest  restaurant  concept is Smokey  Bones BBQ Sports Bar
("Smokey  Bones"),  an internally  developed  concept.  The first restaurant was
opened in 1999 in Orlando,  Florida.  At the end of fiscal 2001, there were nine
Smokey Bones restaurants. In June 2001, the Company announced that it will begin
national expansion of Smokey Bones.

     The table on the following  page shows the  Company's  growth and lists the
number of restaurants operated by Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze and
Smokey  Bones as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970.  The final column in
the table lists the Company's total sales for the years indicated.

              Company-Operated Restaurants Open at Fiscal Year End



Strategy

     The  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments: Quick Service,  Midscale,  Casual Dining and Fine Dining. The industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains.
The Company believes that capable operators of strong  multi-unit  concepts will
have the opportunity to increase their share of the Casual Dining segment.



     The Company is a leader in the Casual  Dining  segment and is  committed to
the following three strategic building blocks:

        o             leadership development as a core competency;
        o             service and hospitality excellence; and
        o             culinary and beverage excellence.

     The Company supports these three strategic  imperatives with its continuing
commitment to diversity literacy and technology  literacy.  The Company believes
that its  continuing  focus on these three  building  blocks,  supported  by its
commitment to diversity and technology,  provides a strong foundation for future
growth.  The Company plans to grow by increasing  the number of  restaurants  in
each of its existing concepts and by developing or acquiring additional concepts
that can be expanded profitably.

Restaurant Concepts

Red Lobster

     Red  Lobster is the largest  Casual  Dining,  seafood-specialty  restaurant
operator it the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish,
shrimp, crab, lobster,  scallops, and other seafood in a casual atmosphere.  The
menu  includes a variety of specialty  seafood and  non-seafood  appetizers  and
desserts.  For the  thirteenth  consecutive  year,  Red  Lobster  was named Best
Seafood  Chain in  America in the annual  "Choice In Chains"  national  consumer
survey published in the March 2001 issue of Restaurants & Institutions magazine.
It is also the  recent  winner  of  Restaurant  Business  Magazine's  2001  Menu
Strategist Award for innovative menu offerings.

     Dinner  entree  prices  range  from  $7.25 to  $23.00,  with fresh fish and
certain lobster items available at market price.  Lunch entree prices range from
$4.99 to $10.99.  During  fiscal 2001,  the average check per person was between
$15.00 and $16.00,  with alcoholic  beverages  accounting for about 9 percent of
Red Lobster's sales. Red Lobster maintains  approximately 142 different menus to
reflect geographic differences in consumer preferences, prices and selections in
its trade areas, as well as a lower-priced children's menu.

     Fiscal 2001 was a record  year in both sales and  profits for Red  Lobster.
For the year,  same-restaurant sales at Red Lobster increased 5.9 percent. As of
the end of fiscal 2001, Red Lobster had enjoyed fourteen consecutive quarters of
same-restaurant sales increases.

Olive Garden

     Olive  Garden is the  market  share  leader  among  Casual  Dining  Italian
restaurants  in North  America.  Olive  Garden's  menu  includes  a  variety  of
authentic Italian foods featuring fresh  ingredients,  and an expanded wine list
that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy.  The menu includes
antipasti  (appetizers);  soups,  salad and garlic  breadsticks;  baked  pastas;
sauteed specialties with chicken,  seafood and fresh vegetables;  grilled meats;
and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for
its espresso and cappuccino.

     Dinner  entree  prices  range from $7.50 to $15.95,  and most lunch  entree
prices range from $5.75 to $8.95. The price of each entree also includes as much
fresh salad or soup as a guest  desires.  During fiscal 2001,  the average check
per person was $12.50 to $13.50, with alcoholic beverages accounting for about 9
percent  of Olive  Garden's  sales.  Olive  Garden  maintains  approximately  24
different dinner menus and 18 lunch menus to reflect  geographic  differences in
consumer preferences,  prices and selections in its trade areas, as well as four
different lower-priced children's' menus.

     Fiscal 2001 was a record year for profits at Olive Garden.  Same-restaurant
sales at Olive Garden increased 7.2 percent during fiscal 2001. Olive Garden has
had 27 consecutive quarters of same-restaurant  sales increases as of the end of
fiscal 2001.



Bahama Breeze

     Bahama  Breeze  is a  Caribbean-themed  restaurant  which  offers  guests a
distinctive island dining experience. The first Bahama Breeze was opened in 1996
and met with strong positive  consumer  response.  The Company continued to test
the concept by opening a limited number of additional restaurants in each of the
following years, and began national  expansion of the concept in 1998. In fiscal
2001,  the Company  opened seven Bahama Breeze  restaurants in four new markets,
bringing the total to 21 restaurants in 15 markets.  The concept continues to be
well received by guests,  with strong sales  volumes and  earnings.  The Company
plans to open eight to ten new Bahama Breeze restaurants in fiscal 2002.

Smokey Bones BBQ Sports Bar

     The  Company's  newest  Casual  Dining  restaurant  concept,  Smokey Bones,
combines  barbeque with a relaxed sports bar atmosphere.  The Company opened the
first Smokey  Bones in September  1999.  There are  currently  nine Smokey Bones
restaurants,  and the  Company  plans  to open  eight  to ten new  Smokey  Bones
restaurants  in fiscal 2002. In June 2001,  the Company  announced  that it will
begin national expansion of Smokey Bones.

Recent and Planned Growth

     During fiscal 2001,  the Company opened 31 new  restaurants  (excluding the
relocation  of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and  rebuilding  at existing
sites) and closed  four  restaurants.  This  resulted  in a net  increase  of 27
restaurants in operation (or 29 including the relocation of existing restaurants
to new sites and  rebuilding  at  existing  sites).  The  Company  plans to open
approximately 40 to 49 new Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze and Smokey
Bones  restaurants  during fiscal 2002  (excluding  relocations).  The Company's
actual and  projected  new  openings by concept  (excluding  the  relocation  of
existing  restaurants to new sites and  rebuilding at existing  sites) are shown
below.


     The Company's  objective is to continue to expand its current  portfolio of
restaurant concepts,  and to develop or acquire additional concepts which can be
expanded  profitably.  It is  currently  testing  new  ideas and  concepts,  and
expanding  Bahama  Breeze  and Smokey  Bones  nationally  in light of  favorable
consumer response.  The Company also regularly evaluates  potential  acquisition
candidates  to assess  whether they would  satisfy the  Company's  strategic and
financial  objectives.  At present,  the Company has not identified any specific
acquisitions.

     The Company  will  continue to focus on  improving  operational  returns at
Olive  Garden  and Red  Lobster,  and limit new  restaurant  expansion  of those
concepts to the  highest-potential  sites. Olive Garden's expansion will include
its recently  developed "Tuscan Farmhouse" design, an outgrowth of the Company's
collaboration  with  Rocca del  Macie,  a  family-owned  winery in  Tuscany.  In
addition,  the Company  plans to expand Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones at a pace
that will enable each new  restaurant to capture the concept's  full  potential.
The  specific  number of openings  will depend upon other  factors,  such as the
Company's ability to locate appropriate sites,  negotiate acceptable purchase or
lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits,  complete construction
and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel.  Other factors
that may affect  the  ability of the  Company to meet its  projected  restaurant
openings are set forth on Exhibit 99, which is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Company  considers  location to be a critical  factor in  determining a
restaurant's  long-term success,  and the Company devotes  significant effort to
the site  selection  process for new  locations.  Prior to entering a market,  a



thorough  study is conducted to determine  the optimal  number and  placement of
restaurants.  The Company's  site  selection  process  incorporates a variety of
analytical techniques to evaluate key factors.  These factors include trade area
demographics,  such as target  population  density and household  income levels;
competitive influences in the trade area; the site's visibility,  accessibility,
and traffic  volume;  and proximity to activity  centers such as shopping malls,
hotel/motel  complexes,  offices and universities.  Members of senior management
evaluate,  inspect and approve each  restaurant  site prior to its  acquisition.
Constructing and opening a new restaurant  typically takes 120 to 180 days after
the site is acquired and permits are obtained.

     The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment,
size and dining capacity of the eight Red Lobster and nine Olive Garden openings
(excluding  relocations  of existing  restaurants)  that occurred  during fiscal
2001.



     The Company  systematically reviews the performance of its restaurant sites
to ensure that each  restaurant  meets its  standards.  When a restaurant  falls
below  minimum  standards,  a thorough  analysis is completed  to determine  the
causes,  and marketing and  operational  plans are  implemented  to improve that
restaurant's performance.  If performance does not improve to acceptable levels,
the site is  evaluated  for  relocation,  closing  or  conversion  to one of the
Company's other concepts.

     During  fiscal 2001,  the Company  permanently  closed two and relocated or
rebuilt  seven Red  Lobster  restaurants  in the  United  States,  and closed or
relocated  no  restaurants  in  Canada.  During  the same  period,  the  Company
permanently  closed two and relocated or rebuilt three Olive Garden  restaurants
in the United States, and none in Canada.

Restaurant Operations

     The Company believes that high-quality restaurant management is critical to
its long-term  success.  It also believes that its leadership  position,  strong
success-oriented   culture  and  various  short-term  and  long-term   incentive
programs,  including stock options and restricted stock, help attract and retain
highly motivated restaurant managers.

     The  Company's  restaurant  management  structure  varies  by  concept  and
restaurant  size.  Each  restaurant is led by a general  manager and one to four
additional  managers,  depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of
the  restaurant.  Each restaurant  also employs  approximately  65 to 140 hourly
employees,  most of whom work part-time.  The Company issues detailed operations
manuals  covering  all  aspects  of  restaurant  operations  as well as food and
beverage  manuals  which  detail the  preparation  procedures  of the  Company's
formulated  recipes.  The restaurant  management  teams are  responsible for the
day-to-day  operation of each  restaurant and for ensuring  compliance  with the
Company's  operating  standards.  At the  Company's  two largest  concepts,  Red
Lobster and Olive Garden,  restaurant general managers report to directors,  and
each  director  is  responsible  for seven to 14  restaurants.  Restaurants  are
visited regularly by all levels of supervision to ensure strict adherence to all
aspects of the Company's standards.

     Each concept's vice president or director of training, together with senior
operations  executives,  is  responsible  for developing  and  maintaining  that
concept's  operational training programs.  These efforts include a 12-to-15 week
training program for management  trainees,  and continuing  development programs
for  managers,  supervisors  and  directors.  The  emphasis of the  training and
development  programs  varies by restaurant  concept,  but includes  leadership,
restaurant  business  management  and culinary  skills.  The Company also uses a
highly structured  training program to open new restaurants,  including training
teams consisting of groups of employees experienced in all aspects of restaurant
operations. The opening training teams typically begin on-site training one week
prior to opening and remain on location one week following the opening. They are
phased out when  appropriate to enable a smooth  transition to the  restaurant's
operating staff.



Quality Assurance

     The  Company's   Quality   Assurance   Department  helps  ensure  that  all
restaurants provide  high-quality food products in a clean and safe environment.
Through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at the Company's North American
laboratories  and through "Point Source  Inspection" in  southeastern  Asia, the
Company  seeks to  ensure  that all  seafood  purchased  meets  or  exceeds  its
specifications.  Since  1976,  the  Company  has  maintained  a  microbiological
laboratory  to  routinely  test seafood and  commodity  products for quality and
microbiological  safety.  In addition,  quality  assurance  managers  visit each
restaurant  periodically  throughout  the year to review food  handling,  and to
provide  education  and  training  in food  safety and  sanitation.  The quality
assurance  managers  also serve as a liaison to  regulatory  agencies  on issues
relating to food safety.  The Company uses  independent  third party auditors to
inspect and evaluate  vendors of commodity  food products.  In this manner,  the
Company attempts to ensure that its suppliers are maintaining good manufacturing
practices and are operating  with the  comprehensive  industry  standard  Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Points programs in place.

Purchasing and Distribution

     The Company's  ability to ensure a consistent  supply of high-quality  food
and supplies at  competitive  prices to all of its restaurant  concepts  depends
upon procurement from reliable sources.  The Company's purchasing staff sources,
negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,500  suppliers in 45
countries.  Suppliers are required to meet strict quality  control  standards in
the  development,  harvest,  catch and production of food products.  Competitive
bids,  long-term contracts and long-term vendor relationships are routinely used
to manage availability and cost of products.

     The  Company  believes  that  its  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a
significant  competitive  advantage.  The Company's  purchasing  staff routinely
travels  within  the  United  States  and  internationally  to  source  over 100
varieties of top-quality  seafood at competitive  prices.  The Company  believes
that it has  established  excellent  long-term  relationships  with key  seafood
vendors,  and sources  product  directly  from the vendors  when  possible.  The
Company operates a procurement  office in Singapore to source products  directly
from Asia. While the supply of certain seafood species is volatile,  the Company
believes that it has the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to
adjust its menus as required.  All other  essential food products are available,
or  can  be  made  available  upon  short  notice,  from  alternative  qualified
suppliers. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products,
inventories in the restaurants  have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation
to revenues. Controlled inventories of specified products are distributed to all
restaurants through national distribution companies.

Advertising and Marketing

     The  Company  believes  that it has  developed  significant  marketing  and
advertising  capabilities.  The  Company's  size  enables  it to  be a  dominant
advertiser in the Casual Dining segment of the restaurant industry.  The Company
leverages  the  efficiency  of  national  network  television   advertising  and
supplements  it  with  local  market  television   advertising.   The  Company's
restaurants  appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and it uses advertising and
product  promotions  to  attract  customers.  The  Company  implements  periodic
promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain and increase its sales and profits.  It
also relies on radio and newspaper advertising,  as well as newspaper and direct
mail couponing programs, as appropriate,  to attract customers.  The Company has
developed  and  consistently  uses  sophisticated  consumer  marketing  research
techniques   to  monitor   customer   satisfaction   and   customers'   evolving
expectations.

Employees

     At the end of fiscal  2001,  the  Company  employed  approximately  128,900
persons.  Of these  employees,  approximately  1,200 were  corporate  or concept
personnel  located  in the  Company's  restaurant  support  center  in  Orlando,
Florida,  approximately  5,300  were  restaurant  management  personnel  in  the
restaurants  or in field  offices,  and the  remainder  were  hourly  restaurant
personnel. Of the restaurant support center employees,  approximately 56 percent
were in management and the balance were administrative or office employees.  The
operating  executives  of the  Company  have an average of more than 13 years of
experience with the Company.  The restaurant  general  managers average 11 years
with the Company.  The Company believes that it provides working  conditions and
compensation  that  compare  favorably  with  those  of  its  competition.  Most
employees,  other than restaurant


management and corporate  management,  are paid on an hourly basis.  None of the
Company's  employees  are  covered by a  collective  bargaining  agreement.  The
Company considers its employee relations to be good.

Management Information Systems

     The Company  strives for  leadership  in the  restaurant  business by using
technology  as a competitive  advantage.  Since 1975,  computers  located in the
restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the  restaurants.  The
Company has implemented  systems targeted at improved  financial  control,  cost
management,   enhanced  guest  service  and  improved  employee   effectiveness.
Management  information  systems  are  designed  to be  used  across  restaurant
concepts,  yet are  flexible  enough to meet the unique  needs of each  specific
restaurant  concept.  The Company is currently  upgrading both its financial and
human resource  (including  payroll and benefits)  systems using web enabled and
fully integrated  application  suites.  The  implementation of a high-speed data
network  connecting all  restaurants to all current and future  applications  is
also currently  underway.  Implementation  of these projects is expected to take
place during fiscal 2002.

     Restaurant  support  is  provided  from the  restaurant  support  center in
Orlando,  Florida,  seven days a week, 24 hours a day. A communications  network
sends and  receives  critical  business  data to and from the  restaurants  each
night,  providing  timely and  extensive  information  each  morning on business
activity in every location.  The restaurant  support center houses the Company's
data center,  which contains  sufficient  computing power to process information
from all  restaurants  quickly and  efficiently.  The Company's  information  is
processed  in a secured  environment  to protect  both the  actual  data and the
physical assets. The Company guards against business interruption by maintaining
a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical  business  information
off-site  and testing the disaster  recovery  plan at a hot-site  facility.  The
Company uses internally  developed  proprietary  software,  as well as purchased
software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to
be distributed effectively to each of the Company's restaurant locations.

     The  Company's  management  believes  its current  systems and the upgrades
expected to be implemented  during fiscal 2002 will well position the Company to
support  current  needs as well as future  growth.  The Company is  committed to
maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing
technology.  The Company uses a strategic  information  systems planning process
that is integrated into the Company's  overall business planning and approved by
senior  management.  Information  systems  projects are  prioritized  based upon
strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.

Competition

     The  restaurant  industry is  intensely  competitive  with  respect to food
quality,  price,  service,  restaurant  location,  concept,   attractiveness  of
facilities,  and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and  marketing  programs.  The
restaurant  business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes;  national,
regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the
type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers' discretionary
purchasing  power.  The Company  competes  within each market with  national and
regional chains as well as locally-owned restaurants, not only for customers but
also for  management  and hourly  personnel  and  suitable  real  estate  sites.
Restaurants  face growing  competition from the supermarket  industry,  which is
offering "convenient meals" in the form of improved entrees and side dishes from
the deli section.  The Company expects intense competition to continue in all of
these areas.

     Other  factors  pertaining  to the  Company's  competitive  position in the
industry are addressed under the sections entitled "Forward-Looking Statements,"
"Purchasing  and  Distribution,"  "Advertising  and  Marketing," and "Management
Information Systems," and elsewhere in this report.

Trademarks and Related Agreements

     The  Company  regards  its Darden  Restaurants(R),  Red  Lobster(R),  Olive
Garden(R),  Bahama  Breeze(R) and Smokey  Bones(R) BBQ Sports Bar service marks,
and other variations of these service marks, as having  significant value and as
being important in marketing the restaurants.  The Company's policy is to pursue
registration of its important service marks and trademarks whenever possible and
to oppose vigorously any infringement of them.




     The only restaurant  operations outside of North America  historically have
been conducted  through Red Lobster Japan Partners,  a partnership  venture with
the  Japanese  retailer  JUSCO  that was  established  in 1982.  The  historical
financial results of Darden exclude the results of such operations. On April 26,
1995,  the  Darden  subsidiary,  GMRI,  entered  into  an Area  Development  and
Franchise  Agreement  with Red Lobster  Japan  Partners,  which  operated 34 Red
Lobster  restaurants  in  Japan  as of May 27,  2001.  Darden  does  not have an
ownership interest in Red Lobster Japan Partners. Royalty income is not material
to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Seasonality

     The Company's sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.  During fiscal years 2000
and 2001,  the Company's  sales were highest in the spring,  lowest in the fall,
and  comparable  during winter and summer.  Severe  weather,  storms and similar
conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.

Government Regulation

     The Company is subject to various  federal,  state and local laws affecting
its  business.  Each of the  Company's  restaurants  must comply with  licensing
requirements  and  regulations by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which
include  health,  safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which
the restaurant is located.  The development and operation of restaurants  depend
on selecting and acquiring  suitable  sites,  which are subject to zoning,  land
use, environmental,  traffic and other regulations. To date, the Company has not
been  significantly  affected  by any  difficulty,  delay or  failure  to obtain
required licenses or approvals.

     Presently  about  9  percent  of  sales  are  attributable  to the  sale of
alcoholic beverages.  Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each
site (in most  cases,  on an  annual  basis)  and  licenses  may be  revoked  or
suspended  for cause at any time.  These  regulations  relate to many aspects of
restaurant operation,  including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours
of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling,
storage and  dispensing of alcoholic  beverages.  The failure of a restaurant to
obtain  or  retain  these  licenses  would  adversely  affect  the  restaurant's
operations.  The  Company  is also  subject  in  certain  states to  "dram-shop"
statutes,  which  generally  provide an injured party with  recourse  against an
establishment  that  wrongfully  serves  alcoholic  beverages to an  intoxicated
person,  causing the injury.  The Company carries liquor  liability  coverage as
part of its comprehensive general liability insurance.

     The  Company is also  subject to federal  and state  minimum  wage laws and
other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits,  working conditions,
safety  standards,  and hiring and employment  practices.  Changes in these laws
during fiscal 2001 have not had a material effect on the Company's operations.

     The Company is currently operating under a Tip Rate Alternative  Commitment
("TRAC")  agreement  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service.   Through  increased
educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the
likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported
tips.

     The Company is subject to federal and state environmental regulations,  but
these rules have not had a material effect on the Company's  operations.  During
fiscal  2001,  there were no material  capital  expenditures  for  environmental
control facilities and no such expenditures are anticipated.

     The Company  continues to monitor its facilities  for  compliance  with the
Americans  With  Disabilities  Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state statutes in
order to conform to their  requirements.  Under the ADA and related  state laws,
the Company could be required to expend funds to modify its  restaurants to make
them more readily  accessible to disabled persons,  to better provide service to
disabled  persons,  or to make  reasonable  accommodation  for the employment of
disabled persons.

Forward-Looking Statements

     Certain information included in this report and other materials filed or to
be filed by the Company with the Commission (as well as information  included in
oral or written  statements made or to be made by, or on behalf of, the Company)
may contain  statements that are  forward-looking  within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  This forward-looking  information is based on
assumptions   concerning   important   risks  and   uncertainties   that   could
significantly affect anticipated results in the future and,  accordingly,  could
cause the  actual  results to differ  materially  from  those  expressed  in the
forward-looking  statements.  These risks and uncertainties include competition,
economic and market conditions,  changes in food and other costs, the importance
of locations,  government  regulations and the Company's  ability to achieve its
growth  objectives,  each of which is more specifically  discussed in Exhibit 99
filed with and incorporated into this report.



Item 2.  PROPERTIES

     As of May 27, 2001, the Company operated 1,168  restaurants  (including 661
Red  Lobster,  477  Olive  Garden,  21  Bahama  Breeze  and  nine  Smokey  Bones
restaurants) and one Olive Garden Cafe in the following locations:



     Of the Company's  1,168  restaurants  and the Olive Garden Cafe open on May
27, 2001,  752 were on owned sites and 417 were on leased sites.  The 417 leases
are classified as follows:

      Land-Only Leases (Darden owns buildings and equipment)........         301
      Ground and Building Leases....................................          61
      Space/In-Line/Other Leases....................................          55
                                                                            ----

           Total....................................................         417
                                                                             ===

     During fiscal 1999, the Company formed two subsidiary corporations, each of
which  elected to be taxed as a Real  Estate  Investment  Trust  ("REIT")  under
Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. These elections limit the
activities for both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets.  The
formation  of these two REITs is  designed  primarily  to assist the  Company in
managing its real estate  portfolio  and possibly to provide a vehicle to access
future capital markets.

     Both REITs are non-public REITs. Through its subsidiary  companies,  Darden
indirectly  owns 100% of all voting  stock and  greater  than 99.5% of the total
value of each REIT. For financial reporting purposes, both REITs are included in
Darden's consolidated group.
     The  Company  owns its  executive  offices,  culinary  center and  training
facilities  in Orlando,  Florida.  Except in limited  instances,  the  Company's
restaurant   sites  and  other  facilities  are  not  subject  to  mortgages  or
encumbrances securing money borrowed by the Company from outside sources.

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time, the Company is made a party to legal proceedings arising

have  a  materially  adverse  impact  on  its  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows. See the section entitled "Government Regulation" for a
