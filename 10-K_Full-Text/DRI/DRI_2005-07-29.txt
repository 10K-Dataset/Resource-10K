Condition and Results of Operations  incorporated by reference in Item 7 of this
Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in
Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Background

     We opened our first  restaurant,  a Red Lobster,  in  Lakeland,  Florida in
1968.  Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden,  for whom we are named.  We
were acquired by General Mills,  Inc. in 1970. In May 1995, we became a separate
publicly  held company when General Mills  distributed  all  outstanding  Darden
stock to General Mills' stockholders.

     The number of Red Lobster and Olive Garden  restaurants  open at the end of
fiscal 2005 decreased by one and increased by 20,  respectively,  as compared to
the end of fiscal 2004. Red Lobster has grown from six  restaurants in operation
at the end of fiscal  1970 to 679  restaurants  in North  America  by the end of
fiscal 2005. Olive Garden,  an internally  developed  concept,  opened its first
restaurant in Orlando, Florida in fiscal 1983, and by the end of fiscal 2005 had
expanded to 563 restaurants in North America.

     Bahama Breeze is an internally developed concept with a Caribbean theme. In
fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando,  Florida.  At
the end of fiscal 2005, there were 32 Bahama Breeze restaurants.

(based on U.S. revenues from company-owned restaurants).




     Smokey Bones is also an internally developed concept featuring barbeque and
other  grilled  favorites  served in an  inviting  mountain-lodge  setting  that
features  televised  sports.  The first  restaurant was opened in fiscal 2000 in
Orlando,  Florida.  At the end of  fiscal  2005,  there  were 104  Smokey  Bones
restaurants.

     In February  2003,  we opened a new test  restaurant  in  Orlando,  Florida
called Seasons 52. It is a casually  sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with
seasonally  inspired menus  offering fresh  ingredients to create great tasting,
nutritionally  balanced  meals  that  are  lower  in  calories  than  comparable
restaurant  meals.  At the end of fiscal  2005,  there  were  three  Seasons  52
restaurants.

     The table  below  shows our  growth  and  lists the  number of  restaurants
operated by Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,  Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones and Seasons
52 as of the end of each fiscal year since 1970.  The final  column in the table
lists our total sales for the years indicated.

Strategy

     The  restaurant  industry is generally  considered  to be comprised of four
segments: quick service,  midscale,  casual dining and fine dining. The industry
is highly  fragmented and includes many independent  operators and small chains.
We  believe  that  capable  operators  of strong  multi-unit  concepts  have the
opportunity  to increase  their share of the casual dining  segment.  We plan to
grow by increasing the number of  restaurants  in each of our existing  concepts
and by  developing  or  acquiring  additional  concepts  that  can  be  expanded
profitably.

     While we are a leader in the casual  dining  segment,  we know we cannot be
successful  without a clear sense of who we are. Our core purpose is "To nourish
and  delight  everyone we serve."  This core  purpose is  supported  by our core
values:

     o    Integrity and fairness;
     o    Respect and caring;
     o    Diversity;
     o    Always learning/always teaching; o Being "of service"; o Teamwork; and
     o    Excellence.

     Our mission is to be "The best in casual dining,  now and for generations."
We believe we can achieve  this goal by  continuing  to build on our  historical
strength  as a  multi-brand  casual  dining  company,  which is  grounded in our
commitment to combining the following areas:

     o    A strong culture that inspires and engages our people with firmly held
          values,  a clear  mission,  and a core  purpose to nourish and delight
          everyone we serve;
     o    Competitively superior leadership;
     o    Brand management excellence;
     o    Restaurant operating excellence; and
     o    Restaurant support excellence.

     Our strategic  framework also includes two points that we believe  separate
us from our competition. We are committed to:

     o    Being a  multi-brand  restaurant  company  that is bound  together  by
          common operating practices and a unifying culture which serves to make
          us stronger than the sum of our parts; and
     o    Obtaining  insights from our guests and employees to create  powerful,
          broadly appealing brands and to develop successful people.





Restaurant Concepts

Red Lobster

     Red  Lobster is the largest  casual  dining,  seafood-specialty  restaurant
operator in the United States. It offers an extensive menu featuring fresh fish,
shrimp,  crab, lobster,  scallops and other seafood in a casual atmosphere.  The
menu includes a variety of specialty seafood and non-seafood entrees, appetizers
and desserts.

     Most dinner entree prices range from $8.50 to $28.75,  with certain lobster
items available by the pound or at market price.  Most lunch entree prices range
from $5.99 to $11.75.  The price of each entree includes  salad,  side items and
our signature  Cheddar Bay biscuits.  During fiscal 2005,  the average check per
person  was  $17.00  to  $18.00,   with  alcoholic   beverages   accounting  for
approximately  8.2  percent  of  Red  Lobster's  sales.  Red  Lobster  maintains
approximately  101 different menus across its trade areas to reflect  geographic
differences  in  consumer  preferences,  prices  and  selections,  as  well as a
lower-priced children's menu.

Olive Garden

     Olive  Garden is the  market  share  leader  among  casual  dining  Italian
restaurants  in the United  States.  Olive  Garden's  menu includes a variety of
authentic  Italian foods featuring  fresh  ingredients and an expanded wine list
that includes a broad selection of wines imported from Italy.  The menu includes
antipasti  (appetizers);  soups,  salad and garlic  breadsticks;  baked  pastas;
sauteed specialties with chicken,  seafood and fresh vegetables;  grilled meats;
and a variety of desserts. Olive Garden also uses coffee imported from Italy for
its espresso and cappuccino.

     Most dinner entree prices range from $7.95 to $18.95, and most lunch entree
prices range from $5.95 to $9.75. The price of each entree also includes as much
fresh salad or soup and breadsticks as a guest desires.  During fiscal 2005, the
average  check  per  person  was  $14.00 to  $15.00,  with  alcoholic  beverages
accounting for approximately  8.7 percent of Olive Garden's sales.  Olive Garden
maintains  approximately 35 different dinner menus and 25 lunch menus across its
trade areas to reflect geographic  differences in consumer  preferences,  prices
and selections, as well as two children's menus.

Bahama Breeze

     Bahama Breeze is a restaurant that brings guests the feeling of a Caribbean
escape. It offers the food, drinks and atmosphere one might find in the islands.
The menu features  distinctive,  Caribbean-inspired  fresh seafood,  chicken and
steaks as well as signature  specialty drinks. The first Bahama Breeze opened in
1996 and met with strong positive  consumer  response.  We continued to test the
concept by opening a limited  number of  additional  restaurants  in each of the
following years, and began national  expansion of the concept in 1998. While the
concept continued to be well received by guests,  its financial  performance did
not meet our overall  expectations.  Bahama  Breeze closed six  restaurants  and
wrote down the carrying value of four others during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004,  reducing to 32 the total number of restaurants in operation.  In addition
to closing some  underperforming  restaurants  in fiscal  2004,  we made changes
designed to improve the sales,  financial performance and long-term potential of
Bahama Breeze. These changes include  implementing lunch operations,  creating a
new,  more  approachable  dinner menu and reducing the size of a typical  Bahama
Breeze  building and the related capital  investment.  We have postponed any new
restaurant expansion at Bahama Breeze while we evaluate the new prototype, which
opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and the other business building
enhancements.

     Most dinner entree prices at Bahama Breeze range from $9.00 to $20.00,  and
most lunch entree  prices range from $7.00 to $11.00.  During  fiscal 2005,  the
average  check  per  person  was  $22.00 to  $23.00,  with  alcoholic  beverages
accounting for approximately 25 percent of Bahama Breeze's sales.  Bahama Breeze
maintains  six  different  dinner lunch and dinner  menus to reflect  geographic
differences  in  consumer  preferences,  prices  and  selections,  as  well as a
children's menu.

Smokey Bones

     Smokey Bones features  barbequed pork,  beef and chicken,  as well as other
grilled favorites, all served in a lively yet comfortable mountain-lodge setting
that features  televised  sports.  We opened the first Smokey Bones in



September  1999,  and began  national  expansion  of the concept in fiscal 2002.
Smokey  Bones  has been well  received  by  consumers  and  continues  to expand
rapidly.  We opened 35 new Smokey Bones restaurants  during fiscal 2005, and had
104  restaurants  in operation at the end of the fiscal year. We plan to open 25
to 30 new Smokey Bones  restaurants in fiscal 2006. We believe that Smokey Bones
has strong  expansion  potential and is capable of achieving future annual sales
of $500 million or more.

     Most Smokey Bones dinner entree prices range from $9.29 to $14.99, and most
lunch entree prices range from $6.49 to $8.49.  During fiscal 2005,  the average
check per person was $14.00 to $15.00, with alcoholic  beverages  accounting for
approximately  11.2  percent of Smokey  Bones'  sales.  Smokey  Bones  maintains
approximately  12  different  dinner  menus and 12 lunch menus  across its trade
areas to reflect  geographic  differences  in consumer  preferences,  prices and
selections, as well as a children's menu.

Recent and Planned Growth

     During fiscal 2005, we opened 55 new restaurants  (excluding the relocation
of  existing  restaurants  to new sites and the  rebuilding  of  restaurants  at
existing  sites)  and  closed  three  restaurants.  In  addition,  we  had  four
restaurants  closed  temporarily  at the end of  fiscal  2005  that we expect to
reopen during fiscal 2006.  This resulted in a net increase of 56 restaurants in
fiscal 2005. We plan to open approximately 52-68 new Red Lobster,  Olive Garden,
Smokey  Bones  and  Seasons  52  restaurants   during  fiscal  2006   (excluding
relocations  and  rebuilds).  Our actual and  projected  new openings by concept
(excluding relocations and rebuilds) are shown below.

       Totals............................      55                  52-68

     The actual  number of openings for each of our concepts will depend on many
factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable
purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental  permits,  complete
construction,  and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel.
Our  objective  is to  continue to expand our current  portfolio  of  restaurant
concepts,  and to develop or acquire  additional  concepts  that can be expanded
profitably.  We have  continued  to test new  ideas  and  concepts,  and also to
evaluate potential  acquisition  candidates to assess whether they would satisfy
our strategic and financial objectives.

     We consider  location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant's
long-term  success,  and we  devote  significant  effort  to the site  selection
process.  Prior to entering a market,  we conduct a thorough  study to determine
the optimal  number and placement of  restaurants.  Our site  selection  process
incorporates a variety of analytical  techniques to evaluate key factors.  These
factors include trade area  demographics,  such as target population density and
household  income levels;  competitive  influences in the trade area; the site's
visibility,  accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers
such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members
of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to
its  acquisition.  Constructing  and opening a new  restaurant  typically  takes
approximately  180 days on average  after  permits are  obtained and the site is
acquired.

     The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment,
size and dining  capacity of the one Red Lobster,  17 Olive Garden and 35 Smokey
Bones  restaurants  that were opened during fiscal 2005 (excluding  relocations,
rebuilds and conversions of existing restaurants).

     We systematically  review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that
each one meets our standards.  When a restaurant falls below minimum  standards,
we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement  marketing
and operational plans to improve that restaurant's  performance.  If performance
does  not  improve  to  acceptable  levels,  the  restaurant  is  evaluated  for
relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other concepts.

     During  fiscal 2005,  we  permanently  closed three and  relocated  two Red
Lobster   restaurants,   and  rebuilt  two  and  relocated   four  Olive  Garden
restaurants.  During fiscal 2005,  we also wrote down the carrying  value of two
Olive  Garden  restaurants,  one Red  Lobster  restaurant  and one Smokey  Bones
restaurant.  The Smokey Bones  restaurant  was closed  subsequent to fiscal 2005
while the two Olive Garden restaurants and one Red Lobster restaurant  continued
to operate. These write-downs were a result of less-than-optimal  locations.  We
continue to evaluate our site  locations in order to minimize the risk of future
asset impairment charges.

Restaurant Operations

     We believe  that  high-quality  restaurant  management  is  critical to our
long-term  success.  We  also  believe  that  our  leadership  position,  strong
success-oriented   culture  and  various  short-term  and  long-term   incentive
programs, including stock options, restricted stock or stock units, help attract
and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.

     Our restaurant  management structure varies by concept and restaurant size.
Each  restaurant  is led by a  general  manager  and  three  to five  additional
managers,  depending  on  the  operating  complexity  and  sales  volume  of the
restaurant.  Each restaurant also employs approximately 50-180 hourly employees,
most of whom work part-time.  We issue detailed  operations manuals covering all
aspects of  restaurant  operations,  as well as food and beverage  manuals which
detail the  preparation  procedures of our  formulated  recipes.  The restaurant
management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant
and for ensuring compliance with our operating  standards.  At our three largest
concepts,  Red  Lobster,  Olive  Garden and  Smokey  Bones,  restaurant  general
managers report to directors. At Red Lobster and Olive Garden, each director was
responsible  for six to 11 restaurants  at the end of fiscal 2005,  which is our
target range for each director at  established  operating  companies.  At Smokey
Bones, each director was responsible for four to seven restaurants at the end of
fiscal 2005.  Restaurants are visited  regularly by all levels of supervision to
help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards.

     Each concept's vice president or director of training, together with senior
operations  executives,  are  responsible  for developing and  maintaining  that
concept's  operations  training programs.  These efforts include a 12 to 15-week
training program for management  trainees,  and continuing  development programs
for  managers,  supervisors  and  directors.  The  emphasis of the  training and
development  programs  varies by restaurant  concept,  but includes  leadership,
restaurant  business  management  and  culinary  skills.  We also  use a  highly
structured  training  program  to  open  new  restaurants,  including  deploying
training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations.  The opening
training teams  typically begin work one week prior to opening and remain at the
new  restaurant  up to three weeks after the opening.  They are  re-deployed  as
appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant's operating staff.



Quality Assurance

     Our Total  Quality  Department  helps ensure that all  restaurants  provide
safe,  high-quality  food in a clean  and  safe  environment.  Through  rigorous
physical  evaluation and testing at our North American  laboratories and through
"point source  inspection" by our international  team of Quality  Specialists in
several  foreign  countries,  we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our
specifications.  We use  independent  third  parties  to  inspect  and  evaluate
commodity  vendors.  In addition,  any commodity  supplier that produces a "high
risk"  product is subject to a food safety  evaluation  by Darden  personnel  at
least  annually.  We require  our  suppliers  to  maintain  sound  manufacturing
practices  and operate  with the  comprehensive  HACCP food  safety  programs in
place. Since 1976, we have required routine  microbiological  testing of seafood
and other  commodities  for quality and  microbiological  safety.  In  addition,
Darden Total Quality  Managers and third party  auditors  visit each  restaurant
periodically  throughout  the  year  to  review  food  handling  and to  provide
education and training in food safety and sanitation. The Total Quality managers
also  serve as a liaison  to  regulatory  agencies  on issues  relating  to food
safety.

Purchasing and Distribution

     Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies
at competitive prices to all of our restaurant concepts depends upon procurement
from reliable  sources.  Our purchasing staff sources,  negotiates and purchases
food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers in  approximately 45 countries.
Suppliers  must  meet  strict  quality  control  standards  in the  development,
harvest,  catch and production of food  products.  Competitive  bids,  long-term
contracts  and  long-term  vendor  relationships  are  routinely  used to manage
availability and cost of products.

     We believe  that our  seafood  purchasing  capabilities  are a  significant
competitive advantage.  Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United
States and  internationally  to source more than 100  varieties  of  top-quality
seafood at competitive  prices.  We believe that we have  established  excellent
long-term relationships with key seafood vendors, and usually source our product
directly  from  producers  (not brokers or  middlemen).  We operate  procurement
offices  in  Singapore  and  Toronto,  our only  purchasing  offices  outside of
Orlando,  to source products directly from Asia and Canada.  While the supply of
certain seafood species is volatile,  we believe we have the ability to identify
alternative  seafood  products and to adjust our menus as  necessary.  All other
essential  food  products are  available,  or can be made  available  upon short
notice, from alternative  qualified  suppliers.  Because of the relatively rapid
turnover of perishable  food  products,  inventories in the  restaurants  have a
modest  aggregate dollar value in relation to sales.  Controlled  inventories of
specified  products  are  distributed  to all  restaurants  through  independent
national distribution companies.

     Our  supplier  diversity  program  is an  integral  part of our  purchasing
efforts.  Through this program, we identify minority and women-owned vendors and
assist them in establishing supplier  relationships with us. We are committed to
the  development  and growth of minority  and  women-owned  enterprises,  and in
fiscal 2005 we spent approximately 6.6 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, of
our purchasing dollars with those firms.

Advertising and Marketing

     We  believe  we  have  developed   significant  marketing  and  advertising
capabilities.  Our size  enables  us to be a leading  advertiser  in the  casual
dining segment of the restaurant industry. Red Lobster and Olive Garden leverage
the efficiency of national network television advertising and supplement it with
local television advertising. Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones do not use national
television advertising.  Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers
and we use advertising and product promotions to attract customers. We implement
periodic  promotions  as  appropriate  to maintain  and  increase  our sales and
profits. We also rely on radio and newspaper  advertising,  as well as newspaper
and direct mail coupon programs, as appropriate,  to attract customers.  We have
developed  and  consistently  use  sophisticated   consumer  marketing  research
techniques to monitor customer satisfaction and evolving expectations.




Employees

     At the end of fiscal 2005, we employed  approximately  150,100 persons.  Of
these  employees,  approximately  1,300 were  corporate  or  restaurant  concept
personnel  located  in  our  restaurant  support  center  in  Orlando,  Florida,
approximately 6,030 were restaurant  management  personnel in the restaurants or
in field offices,  and the remainder were hourly  restaurant  personnel.  Of the
restaurant  support center  employees,  approximately 60 percent were management
personnel and the balance were administrative or office employees. Our operating
executives  have an  average  of more than 14 years of  experience  with us. The
restaurant general managers average 12 years with us. We believe that we provide
working  conditions and  compensation  that compare  favorably with those of our
competitors.  Most  employees,  other than  restaurant  management and corporate
management,  are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Information Technology

     We strive for leadership in the restaurant  business by using technology as
a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. Since 1975, computers
located in the  restaurants  have been used to assist in the  management  of the
restaurants. We have implemented systems targeted at improved financial control,
cost  management,  enhanced guest service and improved  employee  effectiveness.
Management  information  systems  are  designed  to be  used  across  restaurant
concepts,  yet are flexible  enough to meet the unique needs of each  restaurant
concept.  Several  years ago, we  implemented a suite of  web-enabled  and fully
integrated  financial  and  human  resource  (including  payroll  and  benefits)
systems.   We  also  implemented  a  high-speed  data  network   connecting  all
restaurants  to all current and  anticipated  future  applications.  In the past
year, we have been developing and piloting a next generation technology platform
for our restaurant  point of sale system.  We expect to deploy the new platform,
including new hardware and software,  to all  restaurant  concepts over the next
three years.

     Restaurant  hardware and software  support is provided or coordinated  from
the restaurant support center in Orlando, Florida, seven days a week, 24 hours a
day. A communications  network sends and receives  critical business data to and
from  the  restaurants  throughout  the  day and  night,  providing  timely  and
extensive  information on business  activity in every  location.  The restaurant
support center houses our data center, which contains sufficient computing power
to  process  information  from all  restaurants  quickly  and  efficiently.  Our
information  is  processed in a secured  environment  to protect both the actual
data  and the  physical  assets.  We  guard  against  business  interruption  by
maintaining a disaster  recovery plan, which includes storing critical  business
information off-site,  testing the disaster recovery plan at a hot-site facility
and  providing  on-site  power  backup  via a  large  diesel  generator.  We use
internally developed proprietary  software, as well as purchased software,  with
proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed
effectively to each of our restaurants.

     Our  management   believes  that  our  current   systems  and  practice  of
implementing  regular updates will position us well to support current needs and
future growth. We are committed to maintaining an industry  leadership  position
in information systems and computing technology.  We use a strategic information
systems planning process that involves senior  management and is integrated into
our overall  business  planning.  Information  systems  projects are prioritized
based  upon  strategic,  financial,  regulatory  and  other  business  advantage
criteria.

Competition

     The restaurant  industry is intensely  competitive with respect to the type
and quality of food, price, service,  restaurant location,  personnel,  concept,
attractiveness  of facilities,  and  effectiveness of advertising and marketing.
The  restaurant  business  is often  affected  by  changes in  consumer  tastes;
national,  regional or local economic  conditions;  demographic trends;  traffic
patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers'
discretionary  purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and
regional  chains and  locally-owned  restaurants  for customers,  management and
hourly   personnel  and  suitable  real  estate  sites.  We  also  face  growing
competition from the supermarket  industry,  which offers  "convenient meals" in
the form of improved  entrees and side dishes from the deli  section.  We expect
intense competition to continue in all of these areas.

     Other factors  pertaining to our  competitive  position in the industry are
addressed   under  the  sections   entitled   "Purchasing   and   Distribution,"
"Advertising  and  Marketing,"  "Information  Technology"  and  "Forward-Looking



Statements" elsewhere in this report.

Trademarks and Related Agreements

     We regard our  Darden  Restaurants(R),  Red  Lobster(R),  Olive  Garden(R),
Bahama  Breeze(R),  Smokey Bones  Barbeque & Grill(R) and Seasons  52(R) service
marks, and other variations of these service marks, as having  significant value
and as being  important in marketing  the  restaurants.  Our policy is to pursue
registration  of our  important  service  marks  and  trademarks  and to  oppose
vigorously any infringement of them.  Generally,  with  appropriate  renewal and
use, the registration of our service marks will continue indefinitely.

     Our only restaurant  operations outside of North America  historically have
been  conducted  through an Area  Development  and Franchise  Agreement with Red
Lobster  Japan  Co.,  Ltd.  ("Red  Lobster  Japan"),  an  unaffiliated  Japanese
corporation.  Red Lobster Japan operated 37 Red Lobster  restaurants in Japan as
of May 29, 2005. We do not have an ownership  interest in Red Lobster Japan, but
receive royalty income under the Franchise Agreement.  The amount of this income
is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Seasonality

     Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally.  During fiscal 2005, our sales were
highest in the spring and winter,  followed  by summer,  and lowest in the fall.
During fiscal 2004 and 2003, our sales were highest in the spring, lowest in the
fall,  and  comparable  during winter and summer.  Holidays,  severe weather and
similar  conditions  may  impact  sales  volumes  seasonally  in some  operating
regions.

Government Regulation

     We are  subject to various  federal,  state and local  laws  affecting  our
business.  Each of our restaurants  must comply with licensing  requirements and
regulations  by a number of  governmental  authorities,  which  include  health,
safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is
located.  The development  and operation of restaurants  depend on selecting and
acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use,  environmental,
traffic and other regulations.  To date, we have not been significantly affected
by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

     During   fiscal  2005,   approximately   9.2  percent  of  our  sales  were
attributable  to the sale of alcoholic  beverages.  Regulations  governing their
sale require  licensure by each site (in most cases,  on an annual  basis),  and
licenses may be revoked or suspended  for cause at any time.  These  regulations
relate to many aspects of  restaurant  operation,  including  the minimum age of
patrons and employees,  hours of operation,  advertising,  wholesale purchasing,
inventory  control  and  handling,  and  storage  and  dispensing  of  alcoholic
beverages.  The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would
adversely  affect the  restaurant's  operations.  We also are subject in certain
states to "dram-shop"  statutes,  which generally  provide an injured party with
recourse  against  an  establishment  that  serves  alcoholic  beverages  to  an
intoxicated person, who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry
liquor  liability  coverage  as  part  of our  comprehensive  general  liability
insurance.

     We also are subject to federal and state  minimum  wage laws and other laws
governing  such matters as overtime,  tip credits,  working  conditions,  safety
standards,  and hiring and  employment  practices.  Changes in these laws during
fiscal 2005 have not had a material effect on our operations.

     We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment ("TRAC")
agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  Through increased  educational and
other efforts in the restaurants,  the TRAC agreement  reduces the likelihood of
potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.

     We are subject to federal and state  environmental  regulations,  but these
rules have not had a material  effect on our  operations.  During  fiscal  2005,
there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities
and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.

     Our  facilities  must  comply  with  the  applicable  requirements  of  the
Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA") and related state  accessibility
statutes.  Under the ADA and related  state  laws,  we must  provide  equivalent



service  to  disabled  persons,  and make  reasonable  accommodation  for  their
employment,  and when constructing or undertaking  significant remodeling of our
restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.

Cautionary Factors That Could Affect Our Results

     Described below are important  factors,  risks and uncertainties that could
cause  our  actual  results  to  differ   materially  from  those  projected  in
forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.

     Intense Competition.

     The  casual  dining  sector  of  the   restaurant   industry  is  intensely
competitive with respect to pricing, service,  location,  personnel and type and
quality of food,  and there are many  well-established  competitors.  We compete
within  each  market  with   national   and  regional   restaurant   chains  and
locally-owned  restaurants.  We also face growing competition as a result of the
trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services,  particularly
in the  supermarket  industry  which  offers  "convenient  meals" in the form of
improved entrees and side dishes from the deli section.  We compete primarily on
the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location
of   restaurants,   type  of  concept,   quality  and   efficiency  of  service,
attractiveness  of facilities and  effectiveness  of  advertising  and marketing
programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition will
continue with respect to all of these  factors.  If we are unable to continue to
compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations
would be adversely affected.

     Economic and Business Factors.

     Our business  results depend on a number of  industry-specific  and general
economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. The casual dining sector
of the  restaurant  industry is affected by changes in  national,  regional  and
local economic  conditions,  seasonal  fluctuation  of sales  volumes,  consumer
preferences,  including  changes in consumer  tastes and dietary  habits and the
level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant  concepts,  and consumer spending
patterns.  The  performance  of  individual  restaurants  may also be  adversely
affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather, traffic patterns
and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.

     In addition,  general economic  conditions,  such as recessionary  economic
cycles, a protracted  economic  slowdown,  a worsening  economy or industry-wide
cost  pressures,  could affect  consumer  behavior  and spending for  restaurant
dining  occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings.  Furthermore,  we
cannot predict the effects of actual or threatened  armed conflicts or terrorist
attacks, efforts to combat terrorism,  military action against any foreign state
or group located in a foreign state or heightened  security  requirements on the
economy or consumer  confidence in the United States.  Any of these events could
also affect consumer  spending  patterns or result in increased costs for us due
to security measures.

     Unfavorable  changes in the above factors or in other business and economic
conditions  affecting our customers could increase our costs,  reduce traffic in
some or all of our  restaurants or impose  practical  limits on pricing,  any of
which could lower our profit  margins and have a material  adverse affect on our
financial condition and results of operations.

     Price and Availability of Food, Ingredients and Utilities.

     Our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate
and  react to  changes  in the  price  and  availability  of food,  ingredients,
utilities  and  other  related  costs  over  which we may have  little  control.
Operating  margins for our  restaurants  are subject to changes in the price and
availability of food  commodities,  including  shrimp,  lobster,  crab and other
seafood, as well as beef, pork, chicken, cheese and produce. The introduction of
or changes to tariffs on imported  shrimp or other food products  could increase
our costs and possibly  impact the supply of those  products.  We are subject to
the general risks of inflation. In addition, possible shortages or interruptions
in the  supply of food items  caused by  inclement  weather or other  conditions
beyond our control could adversely affect the availability,  quality and cost of
the items we buy.  Our  restaurants'  operating  margins  are also  affected  by
fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas,  whether as a result
of  inflation or  otherwise,  on which the  restaurants  depend for their energy
supply. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change
in any of these factors could have a significant  adverse  effect on our results
of operations.



     Labor and Insurance Costs.

     Our  restaurant  operations are subject to federal and state laws governing
such matters as minimum wages, working conditions,  overtime and tip credits. We
have a  substantial  number of employees  who are paid wage rates at or slightly
above the minimum wage. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may
need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage  employees  but also the
wages  paid to  employees  at wage  rates  that are above  minimum  wage.  Labor
shortages and increased  employee  turnover could also increase our labor costs.
If competitive  pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting  increased
labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.  In addition,
the  current  premiums  that  we  pay  for  our  insurance  (including  workers'
compensation, general liability, health, and directors' and officers' liability)
may  increase at any time,  thereby  further  increasing  our costs.  The dollar
amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers' compensation and
general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles,  may
also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs.

     Increased advertising and marketing costs.

     If our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotion, if
our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, or if our advertising and
promotion  become  less  effective  than  that  of  our  competitors,  we  could
experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

     Higher-than-anticipated Costs to Open or Close Restaurants.

     Our revenues and expenses can be impacted  significantly  by the number and
timing  of the  opening  of new  restaurants  and the  closing,  relocating  and
remodeling of existing  restaurants.  We incur substantial  pre-opening expenses
each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate or
remodel existing restaurants.  The expenses of opening,  closing,  relocating or
remodeling any of our restaurants,  may be higher than anticipated.  An increase
in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

     Litigation.

     Our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees,  consumers,
suppliers,  shareholders  or others  through  private  actions,  class  actions,
administrative proceedings,  regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome
of litigation,  particularly  class action lawsuits and regulatory  actions,  is
difficult to assess or quantify.  Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek
recovery  of very  large or  indeterminate  amounts,  and the  magnitude  of the
potential  loss  relating to such  lawsuits may remain  unknown for  substantial
periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant.  There
may also be adverse  publicity  associated  with  litigation that could decrease
customer  acceptance of our services,  regardless of whether the allegations are
valid or whether we are  ultimately  found liable.  As a result,  litigation may
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

     Unfavorable Publicity.

     Multi-unit  restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by
publicity  resulting from  complaints or litigation  alleging poor food quality,
food-borne illness,  personal injury, adverse health effects (including obesity)
or other  concerns.  Negative  publicity  may also result from actual or alleged
violations by our  restaurants  of "dram shop" laws which  generally  provide an
injured  party with  recourse  against an  establishment  that serves  alcoholic
beverages  to an  intoxicated  party who then  causes  injury to himself or to a
third party.  Regardless of whether the  allegations  or  complaints  are valid,
unfavorable  publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants,  or only
to a single  restaurant,  could adversely affect public perception of the entire
brand.  Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food
safety could have a material adverse effect on our business.

     Lack of Suitable Locations.

     The success of our restaurants depends in large part on their location.  As
demographic and economic patterns change,  current locations may not continue to
be  attractive  or  profitable.  Possible  declines in  neighborhoods  where our
restaurants  are located or adverse  economic  conditions  in areas  surrounding
those  neighborhoods  could result in reduced  revenues in those  locations.  In
addition,  desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation
of existing  restaurants  may not be  available  at an  acceptable  cost when we
identify a  particular  opportunity



for a new  restaurant  or  relocation.  The  occurrence  of one or more of these
events could have a  significant  adverse  effect on our revenues and results of
operations.

     Government Regulations.

     The restaurant  industry is subject to extensive  federal,  state and local
laws  and   regulations,   including  those  relating  to  building  and  zoning
requirements  and  those  relating  to the  preparation  and sale of  food.  The
development and operation of restaurants  depend to a significant  extent on the
selection and acquisition of suitable sites,  which are subject to zoning,  land
use, environmental,  traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also
subject to licensing and regulation by state and local  authorities  relating to
health,  sanitation,  safety and fire standards and liquor licenses, federal and
state laws governing our relationships with employees  (including the Fair Labor
Standards Act and applicable minimum wage requirements,  overtime, family leave,
tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and citizenship requirements),
federal and state laws which prohibit  discrimination  and other laws regulating
the design and operation of facilities,  such as the Americans With Disabilities
Act of 1990.  In  addition,  we are subject to a variety of  federal,  state and
local laws and regulations  relating to the use, storage,  discharge,  emission,
and disposal of hazardous materials. The impact of current laws and regulations,
the  effect of future  changes in laws or  regulations  that  impose  additional
requirements  and the  consequences of litigation  relating to current or future
laws and  regulations  could  increase our  compliance  and other costs of doing
business  and  therefore  have an adverse  effect on our results of  operations.
Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory  requirements  of federal,  state
and local  authorities  could  result in,  among  other  things,  revocation  of
required  licenses,  administrative  enforcement  actions,  fines  and civil and
criminal liability.

     Failure to Achieve Growth Objectives.

     As part of our  business  strategy,  we intend to  continue  to expand  our
current  portfolio of restaurant  concepts and to develop or acquire  additional
concepts that can be expanded profitably. This strategy involves numerous risks,
and we may not be able to achieve our growth  objectives.  We may not be able to
open all of our planned new  restaurants,  and the new restaurants  that we open
may  not be  profitable  or as  profitable  as  our  existing  restaurants.  New
restaurants  typically  experience an adjustment  period before sales levels and
operating  margins  normalize,   and  even  sales  at  successful   newly-opened
restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in
their initial months of operation.  The opening of new restaurants can also have
an adverse effect on sales levels at existing restaurants.  There are additional
risks involved with  expanding  newer concepts (such as Bahama Breeze and Smokey
Bones) that have not yet proven their long-term viability.  Furthermore,  we may
not be able to develop or acquire additional  concepts that are as profitable as
our existing  restaurants.  Growth through  acquisitions may involve  additional
risks.  For  example,  we may pay too much for a concept  relative to the actual
economic  return,  be required to borrow  funds to make our  acquisition  (which
would  increase  our  interest  expense) or be unable to  integrate  an acquired
concept into our operations.

     The  ability  to open and  profitably  operate  restaurants  is  subject to
various  risks,  such as the  identification  and  availability  of suitable and
economically  viable locations,  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase
terms for new locations,  the need to obtain all required  governmental  permits
(including  zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis, the need to
comply  with  other  regulatory  requirements,  the  availability  of  necessary
contractors and subcontractors,  the ability to meet construction  schedules and
budgets,  the  ability to manage  union  activities  such as  picketing  or hand
billing  which  could  delay  construction,  increases  in  labor  and  building
materials  costs,  the  availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms,
changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays
and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate
amount of time, our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and
general economic and business conditions. At each potential location, we compete
with other  restaurants and retail businesses for desirable  development  sites,
construction  contractors,  management  personnel,  hourly  employees  and other
resources.  If we are unable to  successfully  manage these risks, we could face
increased  costs and lower than  anticipated  revenues  and  earnings  in future
periods.

Item 2.  PROPERTIES

     As of May 29,  2005,  we  operated  1,381  restaurants  (including  679 Red
Lobster,  563 Olive Garden, 32 Bahama Breeze, 104 Smokey Bones and three Seasons
52 restaurants) in the following locations:

  Alabama (22)      Iowa (14)            Nevada (12)           South Dakota (3)
  Arizona (29)      Kansas (11)          New Hampshire (5)     Tennessee (34)

  Georgia (59)      Minnesota (24)       Oklahoma (18)         Wisconsin (20)
  Hawaii (1)        Mississippi (8)      Oregon (12)           Wyoming (2)

  Illinois (57)     Montana (2)          Rhode Island (3)
  Indiana (47)      Nebraska (8)         South Carolina (22)

     Of our 1,381  restaurants  open on May 29, 2005,  838 were located on owned
sites and 543 were located on leased  sites.  The 543 leases are  classified  as
follows:

    Land-Only Leases (we own buildings and equipment)............       423
    Ground and Building Leases...................................        68
    Space/In-Line/Other Leases...................................        52
                                                                       ----
             Total...............................................       543
                                                                       ====

     During fiscal 1999, we formed two  subsidiary  corporations,  each of which
elected to be taxed as a Real Estate  Investment  Trust  ("REIT") under Sections
856  through  860 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  These  elections  limit  the
activities  of both  corporations  to holding  certain real estate  assets.  The
formation of these two REITs is designed  primarily to assist us in managing our
real  estate  portfolio  and  possibly  to provide a vehicle  to access  capital
markets in the future.

     Both REITs are  non-public  REITs.  Through our  subsidiary  companies,  we
indirectly  own 100 percent of all voting stock and greater than 99.5 percent of
the total value of each REIT. For financial reporting  purposes,  both REITs are
included in our consolidated financial statements.

     Of the 15 buildings that make up our executive offices, culinary center and
training  facilities in Orlando,  Florida,  we own 11 and lease four.  Except in
limited instances,  our restaurant sites and other facilities are not subject to
mortgages or encumbrances securing money borrowed by us from outside sources. In
our opinion,  our  buildings  and  equipment  generally  are in good  condition,
suitable for their purposes and adequate for our current and foreseeable  needs.
See also Note 4 "Land, Buildings, and Equipment, Net" and Note 12 "Leases" under
Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in our  2005  Annual  Report  to
Shareholders, incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     We are subject to private lawsuits,  administrative  proceedings and claims
that arise in the ordinary  course of our business.  A number of these lawsuits,
proceedings  and claims may exist at any given  time.  These  matters



typically   involve  claims  from  guests,   employees  and  others  related  to
operational  issues  common to the  restaurant  industry,  and can also  involve
infringement  of, or challenges  to, our  trademarks.  While the resolution of a
lawsuit, proceeding or claim may have an impact on our financial results for the
period in which it is  resolved,  we believe that the final  disposition  of the
lawsuits,  proceedings  and claims in which we are  currently  involved,  either
individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.


     Like other restaurant companies and retail employers, we have been faced in
a few states with allegations of purported  class-wide wage and hour violations.
The following is a brief  description of the more  significant of these matters.
In  view  of the  inherent  uncertainties  of  litigation,  the  outcome  of any
unresolved  matter described below cannot be predicted at this time, nor can the
amount of any potential loss be reasonably estimated.

     In March 2002 and March 2003,  two  purported  class action  lawsuits  were
brought  against us in the Superior Court of Orange County,  California by three
current and former hourly restaurant employees alleging violations of California
labor laws with respect to providing meal and rest breaks.  Although we continue
to believe we provided the required  meal and rest breaks to our  employees,  to
avoid potentially costly and protracted litigation,  we agreed during the second
quarter  of fiscal  2005 to settle  both  lawsuits  and a similar  case filed in
Sacramento  County,  for  approximately  $9.5 million.  Terms of the settlement,
which do not include any admission of liability by us, have received preliminary
judicial  approval,  but  completion of the settlement may not occur for several
months.  We  recorded  settlement  expenses  associated  with these  lawsuits of
approximately  $4.5 million  during fiscal 2005 and  approximately  $5.0 million
during fiscal 2004,  which are included in selling,  general and  administrative
expenses. The settlement amounts of these lawsuits are included in other current
liabilities at May 29, 2005.

     In August  2003,  three  former  employees  in  Washington  filed a similar
purported  class action in Washington  State  Superior  Court in Spokane  County
alleging  violations  of  Washington  labor laws with respect to providing  rest
breaks.  The Court  stayed  the  action  and  ordered  the  plaintiffs  into our
mandatory  arbitration  program;  the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration was
not  granted,  and their  appeal of the denial of  reconsideration  was also not
granted.  We  believe  we  provided  the  required  meal and rest  breaks to our
employees, and we intend to vigorously defend our position in this case.


     Beginning in 2002, a total of five  purported  class action  lawsuits  have
been filed in Superior  Courts of California (two each in Los Angeles County and
Orange County, and one in Sacramento County) in which the plaintiffs allege that
they and other current and former  service  managers,  beverage and  hospitality
managers and culinary  managers were improperly  classified as exempt  employees
under  California  labor laws.  The  plaintiffs  seek unpaid  overtime wages and
penalties. Two of the cases have been removed to arbitration under our mandatory
arbitration  program,  and we are  seeking  to cause the  remaining  cases to be
stayed pending  resolution of the  earliest-filed  cases. We believe we properly
classified  these  employees  as exempt  under  California  law and we intend to
vigorously defend against all claims in these lawsuits.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

     The following table gives  information  about our common shares that may be
issued as of May 29, 2005 under our 2002 Stock  Incentive  Plan  ("2002  Plan"),
Stock Option and  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan of 1995 ("1995  Plan"),  Restaurant
Management  and  Employee  Stock  Plan of 2000  ("2000  Plan"),  Stock  Plan for
Directors ("Director Stock Plan"),  Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
("Director Compensation Plan") and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.






The 2000 Plan

     The 2000 Plan provided for the issuance of up to 5,400,000 shares of common
stock out of our treasury as  non-qualified  stock options,  restricted stock or
restricted  stock  units.  No awards  could be made  under  the 2000 Plan  after
January 1, 2004,  but options and other awards granted prior to that time remain
outstanding  and will vest in  accordance  with their terms.  Only our employees
other than  executive  officers were  eligible to receive  awards under the 2000
Plan.  The  purpose  of the 2000 Plan was to  provide  incentives  and awards to
employees  who  may  be  responsible  for  the  management,   growth  and  sound
development of our restaurants, and to align the interests of employees with the
interests of our shareholders. The 2000 Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee  of the  Board of  Directors.  The  exercise  price of a stock  option
granted  under the 2000 Plan could not be less than the fair market value of the
underlying  stock on the date of grant,  and no option could have a term of more
than ten years. The options currently  outstanding under the 2000 Plan generally
vest one to four  years  after the date of grant and  expire  ten years from the
date of grant. The 2000 Plan was approved by our Board of Directors.

The Director Stock Plan

     The Director  Stock Plan provides for the issuance of up to 375,000  shares
of common stock out of our treasury as non-qualified  stock options,  restricted
stock,  restricted stock units or stock awards.  Our non-employee  directors are
the only persons  eligible to receive  awards under the Director Stock Plan. The
purpose  of the  Director  Stock  Plan is to  provide  incentives  and awards to
non-employee  directors to align their interests with those of our shareholders.
The Director Stock Plan is  administered  by the  Compensation  Committee of the
Board of  Directors.  The  exercise  price of a stock option  granted  under the
Director Stock Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying
stock on the  date of  grant,  and no  option  may have a term of more  than ten
years. The options that are currently  outstanding under the Director Stock Plan
generally  vest one to three  years after the date of grant and expire ten years
from the date of grant.  The  restrictions  on restricted  stock and  restricted
stock units  granted under the plan  generally  lapse one year after the date of
grant. The Director Stock Plan was approved by our Board of Directors. No awards
may be made under the Director Stock Plan after September 30, 2005.

The Director Compensation Plan

     The Director  Compensation  Plan provides for the issuance of up to 105,981
