PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL; RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

The Company, founded in 1846, develops, manufactures and
markets a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products under well-recognized brand names, including ARM & HAMMER and TROJAN. The Company’s business is divided into three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer
International and Specialty Products. The Consumer Domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing and cleaning, such as ARM & HAMMER baking soda and cat litter and SCRUB-FREE and BRILLO cleaning products; and laundry products, such
as XTRA and ARM & HAMMER laundry detergents and XTRA NICE’N FLUFFY fabric softeners. This segment also includes personal care products, such as TROJAN condoms, NAIR depilatories, FIRST RESPONSE and ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test
kits, ARRID antiperspirant and ARM & HAMMER, MENTADENT, CLOSE-UP, PEPSODENT and AIM toothpastes. The Consumer International segment sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines, in
international markets, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Spain. The Specialty Products segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for
a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2004, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products segments
represented approximately 74%, 12% and 14%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales.

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN 2004

On May 28, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Armkel, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, that it did not already own from an affiliate of Kelso & Company. The purchase price
for the acquisition was approximately $254 million plus the assumption of Armkel’s obligations, including $225 million principal amount of Armkel’s 9


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 and approximately $136 million under Armkel’s credit facility. Armkel was subsequently merged into the Company. The Company’s
position in the personal care product line is bolstered by Armkel’s products, which include TROJAN Condoms, NAIR Depilatories and Waxes and FIRST RESPONSE and ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits. Internationally, prior to the
acquisition, Armkel primarily marketed oral care products, depilatories, condoms, skin care products, home pregnancy test kits and other regional niche products. Prior to the acquisition, the Company exerted significant influence over Armkel through
membership on Armkel’s board of directors and various agreements with Armkel, but did not control its operating and financial decisions. As a result, prior to the acquisition, Armkel’s operations were not consolidated in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

On May 28, 2004, in
conjunction with the Armkel acquisition, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a five year term
loan in a principal amount of $100 million, a seven year term loan in the principal amount of $440 million, which term loan may be increased by up to an additional $250 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and a five year
multi-currency revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million. The term loans were used to finance the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Armkel not previously owned by the Company,
pay approximately $136 million outstanding under Armkel’s principal credit facility and refinance the approximately $194 million outstanding under the Company’s principal credit facility. The revolving loans are available, for general
corporate purposes.

On December 22, 2004, the Company issued
$250 million of 6.00% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the “Notes”) in a private offering. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 6.00% per annum, accruing from December 22, 2004, and payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of
each year, commencing on June 15, 2005. The Notes mature on December 15, 2012, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the indenture relating to the Notes. The proceeds were used by the Company principally to redeem $218.6 million
principal amount of 9 ½% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 originally issued by Armkel and assumed by the Company, that were tendered in the Company’s tender offer on November 22, 2004.

As previously disclosed in January 2003, the Company entered into a
receivables purchase agreement in order to refinance $60 million of the Company’s primary credit facility. The Company entered into this transaction to reduce expenses associated with the credit facility and to lower the Company’s
financing costs by accessing the commercial paper market. The Company continues to sell its receivables pursuant to the receivables purchase agreement. During July 2004, as a result of its acquisition of the remaining interest in Armkel that it did
not previously own, the Company amended the agreement to increase the capacity that can be borrowed from $60.0 million to $100.0 million. The proceeds of the increased borrowing were used to make a voluntary term A loan payment under the credit
facility on August 4, 2004.



As previously disclosed in October 2003, the Company acquired from Conopco, Inc., a New York corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC (“Seller”), certain assets of Seller’s oral care business in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and Canada. The purchase price was approximately $104 million in
cash, plus additional performance-based payments of between $5 and $12 million payable at specified times following the closing. Through December 31, 2004, the Company has made performance-based payments of approximately $2.5 million. The
acquisition included assets related to the MENTADENT brand of toothpaste and toothbrushes, PEPSODENT and AIM brands of toothpaste and exclusive licensing rights to the CLOSE-UP brand of toothpaste, in each case in the United States (including Puerto
Rico) and Canada. Assets acquired in the transaction principally include the equipment, inventory, intellectual property, permits, contracts and books and records relating to the aforementioned brands. The integration of this oral care business was
completed in the latter part of 2004.

The financing
transactions referenced above are described in detail under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

,

” which is Item 7 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

As previously disclosed, in January 2002,
the Company acquired Biovance Technologies, Inc. (subsequently renamed C&D Technologies, Inc.), an Oskaloosa, Iowa based producer of specialty animal feed ingredients which complement the Company’s existing range of animal nutrition
products.

The purchase price paid in 2002 was approximately $7.8 million (exclusive of cash acquired) and included the assumption of debt. An additional earn-out payment of $3.4 million was paid in February 2003 based upon C&D
Technologies’ 2002 operating performance. A final earn-out payment of $3.2 million was paid in February 2004 based upon C&D Technologies’ 2003 operating performance.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As a
result of the Armkel acquisition, the Company redefined its reportable segments. These segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. Specifically, the Company’s business is organized
into three reportable segments

,

Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Church & Dwight Specialty Products Division (“SPD”). None of these segments are seasonal, with the exception of the depilatories and waxes product
group in the Consumer Domestic segment which generally performs better in the spring and summer months. Information concerning the net sales, operating income and identifiable assets of each of the segments is set forth in Note 17 to the
consolidated financial statements and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is Item 7 of this report.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

Consumer Domestic

Principal Products

The Company’s founders first marketed baking soda in 1846 for use in
home baking. Today, this product is known for a wide variety of uses in the home, including as a refrigerator and freezer deodorizer, scratchless cleaner and deodorizer for kitchen surfaces and cooking appliances, bath additive, dentifrice, cat
litter deodorizer, and swimming pool pH stabilizer. The Company specializes in baking soda-based products, as well as other products which use the same raw materials or technology or are sold in the same markets. In addition, this segment includes
other deodorizing



and household cleaning products, as well as laundry and personal care products. The following table sets forth the principal products of the Company’s
Consumer Domestic segment.



Deodorizing and Cleaning Product

The Company has sold baking soda since 1846. The ARM & HAMMER trademark
was adopted in 1867. ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda remains the leading brand of baking soda in terms of consumer recognition of the brand name and reputation for quality and value.

The deodorizing properties of baking soda have led to the development of several household products. In 2004, Deodorizing
and Cleaning Products constituted approximately 24% of the Company’s consumer sales and approximately 18% of the Company’s total sales. ARM & HAMMER Carpet and Room Deodorizer was the leading brand in the domestic carpet and room
deodorizer market in 2004. All brand “rankings” contained in this report are based on IRI FDTKS, excluding Wal-Mart, for the 52 weeks ending December 19, 2004.

The Company markets a line of cat litter products such as ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP Clumping Cat Litter, which is the
number two brand in the clumping segment of the cat litter market. Line extensions of SUPER SCOOP are ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BLEND, a premium-priced clumping cat litter which uses silica crystals, baking soda and an anti-microbial ingredient to
inhibit growth of bacterial odors, and ARM & HAMMER EASY FLUSH Clumping Cat Litter, a flushable cat litter that enables consumers to flush litter box clumps in the bathroom so odors do not escape into the home. In 2004, the Company introduced
ARM & HAMMER Multi-Cat Cat Litter, designed for households with more than one cat. The Company also markets a line of pet care products under the LAMBERT KAY brand name. The Company intends to continue to innovate and offer new products under
the ARM & HAMMER brand in the household and pet care categories.

The Company intends to capitalize on the well recognized BRILLO name by extending its line of soap pads and expanding into new categories.

Laundry Products

The Company’s laundry detergents constitute its largest consumer business, measured by sales volume. In 2004, Laundry Products constituted
approximately 39% of the Company’s Consumer Domestic sales and approximately 29% of the Company’s total sales.

The Company markets its ARM & HAMMER Brand Laundry Detergents, in both powder and liquid forms, as value products, priced at a discount from products
identified by the Company as market leaders. The Company markets its XTRA laundry detergent in both powder and liquid at a slightly lower price than ARM & HAMMER Brand Laundry Detergents. Although the powder laundry detergent segment continued
its long-term decline throughout 2004, ARM & HAMMER powder maintained its position as the leading powder detergent value brand by volume share. Early in 2005, the Company launched ARM & HAMMER Detergent Plus a Touch of Softener, which
combines detergent and fabric softener technologies to meet the needs of consumers who want cleaning efficacy with a softening benefit.

The Company’s Laundry Products also include fabric softener sheets that prevent static cling and soften and freshen clothes. The Company also markets
ARM & HAMMER FRESH ‘N SOFT Liquid Fabric Softener. In addition the Company offers another liquid fabric softener, XTRA NICE’N FLUFFY, at a slightly lower price enabling the Company to compete at several price points.

Personal Care Product

The Company entered the personal care business using the unique strengths of
its ARM & HAMMER trademark and baking soda technology, and has expanded its presence through its acquisition of antiperspirants, oral care products, depilatories and reproductive health products

.

The personal care market is highly
innovative and is characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions and intense competition, requiring heavy advertising and promotion. In 2004, Personal Care Products constituted approximately 37% of the Company’s Consumer
Domestic sales and approximately 27% of the Company’s total sales.

ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, when used as a dentifrice, whitens and polishes teeth, removes plaque and leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean. These properties led to the development of a complete line of sodium bicarbonate-based
dentifrice products which are marketed and sold nationally primarily under the ARM & HAMMER DENTAL CARE brand name. In 2004, the Company launched ARM & HAMMER ENAMEL CARE Advanced Cleaning and Natural Whitening toothpastes, based on
proprietary formulation and dual chamber tube packaging technology, which combines the cleaning and whitening properties of baking soda with fluoride and liquid calcium to fill tooth surfaces and restore enamel luster. Early in 2005 the Company
launched ARM & HAMMER ENAMEL CARE with Breath Defense toothpaste, which combines liquid calcium technology with additional long-lasting breath benefits.



The Company also manufactures and markets in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and Canada, the
MENTADENT brand of toothpaste and toothbrushes, PEPSODENT and AIM toothpaste, and has exclusive licensing rights to CLOSE-UP toothpaste from Conopco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever N.V. and Unilever PLC

.

The acquisition
strengthened the Company’s strategically important oral care business, tripling its unit sales and more than doubling its dollar sales within the U.S. oral care sector. Early in 2005 the Company launched MENTADENT REPLENISHING WHITE toothpaste
with Liquid Calcium which strengthens tooth enamel and prevents stains from forming.

The Company’s deodorant and antiperspirant products are marketed under the ARM & HAMMER, ARRID and LADY’S CHOICE brand names. In the past few years the Company has broadened its antiperspirant products
by launching ARRID Total Soft Solid antiperspirants and ARM & HAMMER ULTRAMAX gel antiperspirant. In 2005, the entire ARRID antiperspirant line will be restaged with improved formulas, fragrances and packaging.

Following the Armkel acquisition, the Company now includes in its Consumer
Domestic segment additional products relating to reproductive health (TROJAN condoms and FIRST RESPONSE and ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits) and skin care (NAIR depilatories and waxes).

Condoms are recognized as highly reliable contraceptives as well as an
effective means of reducing the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The TROJAN condom brand has been in use for more than 80 years. In 2004, the brand continued its share leadership in the United States behind the success of such products
as EXTENDED PLEASURE, HER PLEASURE, TWISTED PLEASURE, the continuation of the TROJAN MAN advertising campaign, and an ongoing comprehensive educational program. In 2004, two new products were added to the TROJAN condom line, SHARED PLEASURE and
MAGNUM WITH WARM SENSATIONS, a unique lubricant system which warms the skin on contact for enhanced pleasure. Early in 2005, the Company launched TROJAN MINT TINGLE, a flavored lubricated condom. In addition, the Warming Sensations lubricating
system introduced last year will be extended to the HER PLEASURE line of condoms.

In 2004, FIRST RESPONSE was the number two brand in the home pregnancy and test kit business category. The Company also markets a second brand, ANSWER, which competes in the value segment of the home pregnancy and
ovulation test kit market.

The NAIR line of non-shaving hair
removal products is the number two brand in the United States, with innovative products that address consumer needs for quick, complete and longer-lasting hair removal. The Company offers waxes, depilatory creams and cloth strips under the NAIR
brand name. In 2004, the Company launched a line of “No Touch” depilatory products, including NAIR mousse, a product designed for direct application and improved ease of use.

Consumer International

The Consumer International segment sells a variety of personal care products in international markets, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada,
Mexico, Australia and Spain.

Certain of the Company’s
international product lines are similar to its domestic product lines. For example, the Company markets depilatories and waxes, home pregnancy and ovulation test kits and oral care products in most of its international markets and markets condoms in
Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

The

Company
believes that approximately 21% of its international net sales in this segment are attributable to brands which hold the number one or two position in their respective local markets. With the exception of France and Canada, which each account for
27% of the Company’s international sales in this segment, no other country in which the Company operates accounts for more than 20% of its total international net sales, and no brand accounts for more than 13% of its total international net
sales. Certain of the Company’s international product lines are similar to its domestic product lines.

During the past few years, the Company has expanded its products into other international markets by introducing TAKY/ NAIR waxes and depilatory products
into Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, PEARL DROPS products into Australia, LINEANCE BODY CARE products into Spain and STERIMAR nasal hygiene products into Canada and Australia. LINEANCE, one of the Company’s skin care products,
is the leading supermarket brand in slimming body care in France.



The majority of the products that the Company offers within the Consumer International segment were
formerly Armkel products. However, the Company continues to seek opportunities to expand distribution of ARM & HAMMER products.

COMPETITION FOR CONSUMER DOMESTIC AND CONSUMER INTERNATIONAL

For information regarding Consumer Domestic and Consumer International Products Competition, see “Competitive Environment” in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which is Item 7 of this report.

Product introductions usually involve heavy marketing costs in the year of launch, and the eventual success of the new product and line extensions
described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will not be known for some time.

DISTRIBUTION FOR CONSUMER DOMESTIC

Products
in the Consumer Domestic segment are primarily marketed throughout the United States and Canada and sold through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart, and drugstores. The Company employs a
sales force based regionally throughout the United States. This sales force utilizes the services of independent food brokers in each market. The Company’s products are strategically located in Company plants and public warehouses and either
picked up by customers or delivered by independent trucking companies.

DISTRIBUTION FOR CONSUMER INTERNATIONAL

The
Company’s Consumer International distribution network is based on capacity and cost considerations. In Canada, Mexico, Spain and Australia, finished goods are warehoused internally and shipped directly to customers through independent freight
carriers. In the United Kingdom, all product distribution is subcontracted to a professional distribution company. In France, distribution of consumer products to mass markets is handled internally while distribution of OTC products to pharmacies
and professional diagnostics to laboratories is handled by outside agencies.

SPD

Principal Products

The Company’s SPD segment focuses on sales to businesses and
participates in three product areas: Specialty Chemicals, Animal Nutrition and Specialty Cleaners. The following table sets forth the principal products of the Company’s SPD segment.

(1)

Manufactured and marketed by Armand Products Company, an entity in which the Company holds a joint venture interest.

(2)

Manufactured for the Company by Armand Products Company.

(3)

Distributed by The Armakleen Company, an entity in which the Company holds a joint venture interest.



Specialty Chemicals

The Company’s specialty chemicals business primarily consists of the manufacture, marketing and sale of sodium
bicarbonate in a range of grades and granulations for use in industrial and agricultural markets. In industrial markets, sodium bicarbonate is used by other manufacturing companies as a leavening agent for commercial baked goods, as an antacid in
pharmaceuticals, as a carbon dioxide release agent in fire extinguishers, as an alkaline agent in swimming pool chemicals, and as a buffer in kidney dialysis.

The Company markets and sells ammonium bicarbonate and other specialty chemicals to food and agricultural markets in Europe through its wholly-owned
British subsidiary, Brotherton Speciality Products Ltd.

The
Company’s 99% owned Brazilian subsidiary, Quimica Geral do Nordeste (“QGN”) is South America’s leading provider of sodium bicarbonate.

The Company and Occidental Petroleum Corporation are equal partners in a joint venture named Armand Products Company, which produces and markets potassium
carbonate and potassium bicarbonate. Potassium chemicals are sold to, among others, the glass industry for use in TV and computer monitor screens. Armand Products also manufactures for the Company a potassium carbonate-based animal feed additive for
sale in the dairy industry.

Animal Nutrition Products

A special grade of sodium bicarbonate, as well as sodium
sesquicarbonate, is sold to the animal feed market as a feed additive for use by dairymen as a buffer, or antacid, for dairy cattle. The Company also markets and sells DCAD Plus Feed Grade Potassium Carbonate as a feed additive into the animal feed
market. This product is manufactured for the Company by Armand Products Company.

The Company markets and sells MEGALAC Rumen Bypass Fat, a nutritional supplement made from natural oils, which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high-milk production, resulting in improved
milk yields and minimal weight loss. The product and the trademark MEGALAC are licensed under a long-term license agreement from a British company, Volac Ltd.

The Company also manufactures, markets and sells BIO-CHLOR and FERMENTEN, a range of specialty feed ingredients for dairy cows, which improve rumen
feed efficiency and help increase milk production.

Specialty Cleaners

The Company also provides
a line of cleaning and deodorizing products for use in commercial and industrial applications such as office buildings, hotels, restaurants and the like.

The Company formed a joint venture in 1999 with the Safety-Kleen Corporation called The ArmaKleen Company. The ArmaKleen Company was formed to build a
specialty cleaning products business based on the Company’s technology and Safety-Kleen’s sales and distribution organization. This joint venture distributes the Company’s proprietary product line of aqueous cleaners along with the
Company’s ARMEX Blast Media line. Within two years after formation, the joint venture was affected by Safety-Kleen’s financial difficulties, which led to Safety-Kleen’s Chapter 11 filing and implementation of a major reorganization
during 2000. In 2003 Safety-Kleen emerged from bankruptcy, and although The ArmaKleen Company continues to demonstrate increased stability, the Company is unable to predict the long-term prospects for this joint venture. The Company continues to
pursue opportunities to build a specialized industrial cleaning business using our aqueous-based technology as well as The ArmaKleen Company’s ARMEX Blast Media line of products, which is designed for the removal of a wide variety of surface
coatings.

COMPETITION FOR SPD

For information regarding Specialty Products Competition, see
“Competitive Environment” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is Item 7 of this report. Product introductions usually involve heavy introductory costs in the year of launch,
and the eventual success of the new product and line extensions will not be known for some time.

DISTRIBUTION FOR SPD

In the
SPD segment, the Company markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the United States and Canada. Distribution is accomplished through regional sales offices and manufacturer’s
representatives, augmented by the sales personnel of independent distributors throughout the country. The Company’s products in this segment are located in Company plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking
companies or picked up by customers at the Company’s facilities.



RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY

The Company manufactures sodium bicarbonate for both of its consumer and specialty products businesses at two of its plants
located at Green River, Wyoming and Old Fort, Ohio. The primary source of soda ash, a basic raw material in the production of sodium bicarbonate, used by the Company is the mineral trona which is found in abundance in southwestern Wyoming, near the
Company’s Green River plant. The Company has adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support the requirements of its sodium bicarbonate business and may acquire other leases in the future as the need arises.

The Company is party to a partnership agreement with General Chemical
Corporation, which mines and processes trona reserves in Wyoming. Through the partnership and related supply and services agreements, the Company fulfills a substantial amount of its soda ash requirements, enabling the Company to achieve some of the
economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw material. The Company also has an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company. The partnership agreement and other
supply agreements between the Company and General Chemical are terminable upon two years notice by either company. The Company believes that alternative sources of supply are available.

The Company believes that ample sources of raw materials are available for all of its other major products. Detergent
chemicals are used in a variety of the Company’s products and are available from a number of sources. Bottles, paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers, although the Company chooses to source most of these materials from
single sources under long-term supply agreements in order to gain favorable pricing. Alternative sources of supply are available in case of disruption or termination of the agreements.

The main raw material used in the production of potassium carbonate is liquid potassium hydroxide. Armand Products obtains
its supply of liquid potassium hydroxide under a long term supply arrangement.

Increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the Company’s costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its
customers.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

The Company’s trademarks (identified throughout this annual report in
capitalized letters), including ARM & HAMMER, are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and also with the trademark offices of many foreign countries. The ARM & HAMMER trademark has been used by the Company since the
late 1800’s, and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of the Company’s business. The Company’s other valuable trademarks include TROJAN, NAIR, FIRST RESPONSE, MENTADENT, CLOSE-UP, AIM, PEPSODENT, XTRA, BRILLO,
ARRID, SNO BOL, PARSONS’, SCRUB FREE and CLEAN SHOWER. United States trademark registrations are for a term of 10 years, renewable every 10 years so long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. The Company maintains a
portfolio of trademarks representing substantial goodwill in the businesses using the trademarks.

United States patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. Although the Company actively develops
and maintains a number of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole

.

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG

A group of three Consumer Domestic products customers accounted for approximately 26% of consolidated net sales in 2004, including a single customer,
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.

,

which accounted for approximately 18%. A group of three Consumer Domestic customers accounted for approximately 26% of consolidated net sales in 2003 including Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 17%. This group
also accounted for approximately 23% of net sales (of which Wal-Mart accounted for 16%) in 2002.

The time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short, and, as a result, backlog is not significant.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

The Company conducts research and development primarily at its Princeton and
Cranbury facilities in New Jersey. The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and basic research



to develop differentiated products with new and distinctive features, to provide increased convenience and/or value to its customers. To increase its
innovative capabilities, the Company engages outside contractors for general research and development in activities beyond its core areas of expertise. During 2004, $33.0 million was spent on research activities as compared to $26.9 million in 2003
and $26.9 million in 2002.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Some of the Company’s products are subject to regulation under the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is administered by the Food and Drug Administration, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, which are administered by the
Environmental Protection Agency. The Company is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission in connection with the content of its labeling, advertising, promotion, trade practices and other matters. The Company’s relationship
with certain unionized employees may be overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. The Company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which the Company sells its products.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company’s operations are subject to federal, state and local
regulations governing air emissions, waste and steam discharges, and solid and hazardous waste management activities. The Company endeavors to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations. These steps include periodic environmental audits
of each Company facility. The audits, conducted by an independent engineering concern with expertise in the area of environmental compliance, include site visits at each location, as well as a review of documentary information, to determine
compliance with such federal, state and local regulations. The Company believes that its compliance with existing environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect with regard to the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position. No material capital expenditures relating to environmental control or remediation are presently anticipated.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

Approximately 83% of net sales of the Company (exclusive of unconsolidated entities) in 2004, 91% in 2003 and 92% in 2002 were to customers in the United
States and approximately 92% of long-lived assets of the Company (exclusive of unconsolidated entities) in 2004, 94% in 2003 and 95% in 2002 were located in the United States.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 3,800 employees. The Company is party to a labor contract with the United Industrial Workers of North
America at its London, Ohio plant which contract continues until September 28, 2007. Internationally, the Company employs union employees in France, Spain and Mexico. The Company believes that its relations with both its union and non-union
employees are satisfactory.

RISK FACTORS

The following risks and uncertainties, as well as others described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, could materially adversely affect the
Company’s business, results of operations

and financial condition:

•

The Company has recently developed and commenced sales of a number of new products which, if they do not gain widespread customer acceptance or if they cause sales of the
Company’s existing products to decline, could harm the financial performance of the Company.

The Company has recently introduced a number of new consumer products, such as ARM & HAMMER ENAMEL CARE toothpastes, TROJAN MINT TINGLE condoms, ARM
& HAMMER multi-cat cat litter and line extensions to its NAIR depilatory brand. The development and introduction of new products involves substantial research, development and marketing expenditures which the Company may be unable to recoup if
the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. In addition, if the new products merely cause sales of the Company’s existing products to decline, the financial performance of the Company could be harmed.

•

The Company may discontinue products or product lines which could result in returns, asset write-offs and shut down costs. The Company may also engage in product recalls, which
would reduce its cash flow and earnings.

In
the past, the Company has discontinued certain products and product lines which resulted in returns from customers, asset write-offs and shut down costs. The Company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues
products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand. Product returns, write-offs or shut down costs would reduce cash flow and earnings. Product efficacy or safety concerns could result in product recalls or declining sales,
which would reduce cash flow and earnings.

•

The Company faces intense competition in a mature industry that may require it to increase expenditures and accept lower profit margins to preserve or maintain its market share.
Unless the markets in which the Company competes grow substantially, a loss of market share will result in reduced sales levels and declining operating results

.

During 2004, approximately 83% of the Company’s sales were generated in U.S. markets. U.S. markets for consumer
products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to the Company’s most significant product categories, such as laundry detergents, deodorizers and household cleaning products,
toothpastes and antipersipirants and deodorants. The Company’s unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers, product innovation and its ability to capture market share from competitors. The
Company may not succeed in implementing its strategies to increase domestic revenues.

The consumer products industry, particularly the laundry detergent, personal care and air deodorizer categories, is intensely competitive. To protect its existing market share or to capture increased market share, the
Company may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and introduce and establish new products. Increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing market share and could result in lower sales and profits.
Many of the Company’s competitors, including The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever, Inc., The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, Gillette Co., Henkel, SSL Industries, Reckitt Benkiser, Pfizer and S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., are
substantially larger companies that have greater financial resources than the Company has. These competitors have the capacity to outspend the Company should they attempt to gain market share. In addition, if the Company loses market share and the
markets in which it competes do not grow, the Company’s sales levels and operating results would decline.

•

Providing price concessions or trade terms that are acceptable to the Company’s trade customers, or the failure to do so, could adversely affect sales and profitability.

Consumer products, particularly those that
are value-priced like many of the Company’s products, are subject to significant price competition and in recent years have been characterized by price deflation. From time to time, the Company may need to reduce the prices for some of its
products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share. Any reduction in prices to respond to these pressures would harm profit margins. In addition, if the Company’s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to
offset any reduction in margins, its results of operations would suffer.



Because of the competitive environment facing retailers, many of the Company’s trade customers,
particularly its high-volume retail store customers, have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. To the extent the Company provides concessions or better trade terms, its margins are reduced. Further, if the Company
is unable to maintain terms that are acceptable to its trade customers, these trade customers could reduce purchases of the Company’s products and increase purchases of products from its competitors, which would harm the Company’s sales
and profitability.

•

Reductions in inventory by the Company’s trade customers, including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry, could adversely affect sales in periods during
which the reduction results in reduced orders for the Company’s products.

From time to time the Company’s retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements. Any reduction in
inventory levels by the Company’s retail customers would harm its operating results for the financial periods affected by the reductions. In particular, continued consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory
levels maintained by the Company’s retail customers, which could adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions.

•

A continued shift in the retail market from food and drug stores to club stores and mass merchandisers could cause the Company’s sales to decline.

The Company’s performance also depends upon
the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers. Industry wide, consumer products such as those marketed by
the Company are increasingly being sold in club stores and mass merchandisers, while sales of consumer products by food and drug stores are comprising a smaller proportion of the total volume of consumer products sold. Sales of the Company’s
products are stronger in the food and drug channels of trade and not as strong with the club stores and mass merchandisers. Although the Company has taken steps to improve sales in club stores and mass merchandisers, if it is not successful in
improving sales to these channels, and the current trend continues, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could suffer.

•

Loss of any of the Company’s principal customers could significantly decrease its sales and profitability.

Wal-Mart, including its affiliate Sam’s Club, is the Company’s
largest customer, accounting for approximately 18% of net sales in 2004, 17% of net sales in 2003 and 16% of net sales in 2002. The Company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 26% of net sales in 2004, 26% of net sales in 2003 and
23% of net sales in 2002. The loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by Wal-Mart or any of the Company’s other top customers would harm the Company’s sales and profitability.

•

The Company may make acquisitions that could result in dilution to its current stockholders or increase its indebtedness, or both. In addition, acquisitions that are not properly
integrated or are otherwise unsuccessful could strain or divert the Company’s resources.

The Company has made several acquisitions in the past few years, including the acquisition of USA Detergents, Inc., Biovance Technologies, Inc.,
Unilever’s oral care brands in the United States and Canada and some of the consumer products businesses of Carter-Wallace, Inc., which was completed through the acquisition of Armkel, and may make additional acquisitions or substantial
investments in complementary businesses or products in the future. Any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks, including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products, the
potential disruption of the Company’s ongoing business and, generally, the Company’s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment. These factors could harm the Company’s
financial condition and operating results. Any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures, the issuance of new equity in the Company and the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities. In addition,
any potential acquisitions or investments, whether or not they are ultimately completed, could divert the attention of management and divert other resources from other matters that are critical to the Company’s operations.

•

The Company’s condom product line could suffer if the spermicide N-9 is proved or perceived to be harmful.

The Company’s distribution of condoms under the TROJAN and other
trademarks is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Certain of the Company’s condoms contain the spermicide nonoxynol-9 (N-9). The World Health Organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that N-9
should not be used



rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse, given the ingredient’s potential to cause irritation to
human membranes. The Company expects the FDA to issue non-binding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms with N-9, although the timing of such draft guidance is uncertain. The Company believes that condoms with N-9 provide an acceptable
added means of contraceptive protection and it is cooperating with the FDA concerning the appropriate labeling revisions, if any. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the FDA review. While labeling guidance from the FDA is pending, the
Company has implemented an interim label statement change cautioning against rectal use and multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse.

If the FDA or state governments take action that prohibit or restrict the use of N-9 in condoms (such as new labeling requirements), the Company could
incur further costs from obsolete products, packaging or raw materials, and sales of condoms could decline, which, in turn, could decrease the Company’s operating income.

•

Price increases in raw materials or energy costs could erode the Company’s profit margins, which could harm operating results.

Increases in the prices of raw materials such as surfactants, which are
cleaning agents, paper products and bottles, or increases in energy costs, could significantly affect the Company’s profit margins. The Company uses surfactants and bottles in the manufacture and marketing of laundry and household cleaning
products such as ARM & HAMMER and XTRA laundry detergents and SCRUB FREE and CLEAN SHOWER bathroom cleaners. The Company uses paper products for packaging in many of its consumer and specialty chemical products. If price increases were to occur,
the Company may not be able to increase the prices of its products to offset these increases. This could harm the Company’s financial condition and operating results.

•

The Company is subject to various government regulations in the countries in which it operates that could adversely affect its business.

The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling and
advertising of the Company’s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. In addition, the Company’s operations are subject to
the oversight of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Labor Relations Board. The Company’s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and
foreign countries in which the Company’s products are sold.

In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of condoms, home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. The FDA also exercises a somewhat less rigorous oversight over
cosmetic products such as depilatories. In addition, pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the FDA and the FTC, the FTC has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products, and the FTC regulates the promotion
and advertising of the Company’s other products as well. As part of its regulatory authority, the FDA may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities, machinery, processes and procedures that the Company uses to manufacture
regulated products and may observe compliance issues that would require the Company to make certain changes in the Company’s manufacturing facilities and processes. It may be necessary to make additional expenditures to comply with these
regulatory observations or possibly stop selling certain products until a condition has been remediated. As a result, the Company’s business could be adversely affected.

The Company’s international operations, including the production of over-the-counter drug products, are subject to
regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which the Company manufactures or markets goods. Changes in product standards or manufacturing requirements in any of these jurisdictions could require the Company to make certain modifications to
its operations or product formulations, or to cease manufacturing certain products completely. As a result, the Company’s business could be adversely affected.

•

The Company is subject to risks related to its international operations that could adversely affect the results of operations.

In May 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in
Armkel that the Company did not already own, increasing the scope of the Company’s foreign operations. These operations subject the Company to risks customarily associated with foreign operations, including:

•

currency fluctuations;



•

import and export license requirements;

•

trade restrictions;

•

changes in tariffs and taxes;

•

restrictions or repatriating foreign profits back to the United States; and

•

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.

In all foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment, foreign trade
and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit the Company’s ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the United States and may limit the Company’s ability to convert foreign currency cash flow into
U.S. dollars. Outside the United States, sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies, including the euro, British pound, Brazilian real, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Australian dollar. A weakening of the currencies in which sales
are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated may decrease operating profits and cash flow.

•

Environmental matters create potential liability risks.

The Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including those relating to
the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. A release of such chemicals due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial
liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations. It is possible that the Company
could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could result in a material adverse effect to the results of operations or financial condition.

•

Failure to maximize or successfully assert intellectual property rights could materially impact the Company’s competitiveness.

The Company relies on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to
protect its intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own
intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged
in the future. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the Company’s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the
laws of the United States. The Company’s failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial
condition of the Company.

•

The Company’s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect its financial condition and its ability to operate its businesses and repay the indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $858.7
million of total consolidated indebtedness. This level of indebtedness could (i) limit the Company’s ability to borrow money to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs and
(ii) make the Company more vulnerable to a downturn in its business, industry or the economy in general. In the event of a general increase in interest rates the Company’s interest expense would increase because a substantial portion of the
indebtedness, including all of the indebtedness under the Company’s senior credit facilities, bears interest at floating rates. The Company’s failure to service its indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a
material adverse effect on the business operating results and financial condition of the Company. The terms of the subordinated note and credit agreement place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments the Company can make. This limitation
includes the amount the Company can pay in dividends on its common stock. As long as the Company is not in default under either agreement, the limitation ( which is a percent of net income relative to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio)
is such that the Company does not currently anticipate having an effect on the its ability to pay dividends at its current rate.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On
January 17, 2002, a petition for appraisal, Cede & Co., Inc. and GAMCO Investors, Inc. v. MedPointe Healthcare Inc., was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware demanding a determination of the fair value of shares of MedPointe.
The action was brought by purported former shareholders of Carter-Wallace in connection with the merger on September 28, 2001 of MCC Acquisition Sub Corporation with and into Carter-Wallace. The merged entity subsequently changed its name to
MedPointe. The petitioners sought an appraisal of the fair value of their shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The matter was heard by the court on March 10 and 11, 2003, at which time the petitioners
purportedly held approximately 2.3 million shares of MedPointe. An additional post-trial hearing was held on January 20, 2004 to address the valuation of the Company. The Court determined that the petitioners were entitled to receive an additional
$4.01 per Carter-Wallace share over the $20.44 per share price paid on the merger date, and that interest on the full appraisal value, at the annual rate of 7.5% compounded quarterly, should be added to the award.

MedPointe and certain former Carter-Wallace shareholders were party to an
indemnification agreement pursuant to which such shareholders would be required to indemnify MedPointe from a portion of the damages suffered by MedPointe in relation to the exercise of appraisal rights by the former Carter-Wallace shareholders in
the merger. Pursuant to the agreement, the shareholders agreed to indemnify MedPointe for 40% of any Appraisal Damages (defined as the recovery greater than the per share merger price times the number of shares in the appraisal class) suffered by
MedPointe in relation to the merger; provided, that if the total amount of Appraisal Damages exceeded $33.3 million, then the indemnifying stockholders will indemnify MedPointe for 100% of any damages suffered in excess of that amount. The Company,
in turn, was party to an agreement with MedPointe pursuant to which it agreed to indemnify MedPointe and certain related parties against 60% of any Appraisal Damages for which MedPointe remains liable. The maximum liability to the Company pursuant
to the indemnification agreement was $12 million.

On March 27,
2003, GAMCO Investors, Inc. filed a separate complaint in the New York Supreme Court seeking damages from MedPointe, the former directors of Carter-Wallace, and one of the former shareholders of Carter-Wallace. The complaint alleged breaches of
fiduciary duty in connection with certain employment agreements with former Carter-Wallace executives, the sale of Carter Wallace’s consumer products business to the Company and the merger of MCC Acquisition Sub Corporation with and into
Carter-Wallace. The complaint sought monetary damages and equitable relief, including among other things, invalidation of the transactions. The Company was not named as a defendant in this action and believed it had no liability.

On October 12, 2004, MedPointe and the plaintiffs settled both legal actions.
In connection with the settlements, the Company entered into a settlement agreement and release with MedPointe pursuant to which, in settlement of the Company’s indemnification obligations or other claims that Medpointe may have against the
Company and certain persons related to the Company, the Company agreed to pay MedPointe $8.1 million. Payment was made by the Company on October 13, 2004.



On January 30, 2004 a suit was filed against the Company by Fleming Companies, Inc. in the US Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware. Fleming, a customer of the Company, previously filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on April 1, 2003. Fleming sought the recovery of certain preference
payments and overpayments made to the Company in the amount of approximately $4.2 million. In addition, Fleming claimed that it is owed approximately $1.9 million relating to a vendor agreement with the Company. In December 2004, the Company settled
this matter with the Reclamation Creditors’ Trust, successor in interest to the debtors, including Fleming, in the amount of $1.1 million. This amount was paid in January 2005.

The Company, in the ordinary course of its business, is the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal
actions. The Company believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operation.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (“MD&A”)

Overview

The Company develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products. It recognizes revenues and profits from selling its
products under a variety of brands, including ARM & HAMMER and TROJAN, to consumers through supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers; and to industrial customers and distributors. On May 28, 2004, the Company acquired the joint venture
interest in Armkel owned by affiliates of Kelso & Company, and Armkel was merged into the Company. This is sometimes referred as “the Armkel acquisition.” The discussion of results of operations of Armkel are reflected in the results
of operations since the acquisition on May 28, 2004.

The
Company is divided into three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. Our Consumer Domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing and cleaning, such as ARM & HAMMER baking soda, cat
litter, SCRUB-FREE, BRILLO cleaning products and laundry products, such as XTRA and ARM & HAMMER laundry detergents; and personal care products, such as TROJAN condoms, NAIR depilatories and waxes, FIRST RESPONSE and ANSWER home pregnancy and
ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant and ARM & HAMMER, MENTADENT, CLOSE-UP, PEPSODENT and AIM toothpastes. Our Consumer International segment sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brands as our domestic
product lines, in international markets, including France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Spain. Our Specialty Products segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty
inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, our Consumer Domestic,
Consumer International and Specialty Products segments (“SPD”) represented approximately 74%, 12% and 14%, respectively, of net sales.

For the two year period ended December 31, 2004, the Company’s earnings per share has grown at an average rate of approximately 13%, its sales has
increased from $1,047.1 million in 2002 to $1,462.1 million in 2004 and its gross profit margin increased from 29.7% in 2002 to 36.5% in 2004. The major reasons for these increases stem from the Unilever oral care business and Armkel acquisitions.

The Company operates in highly competitive consumer product
markets, in which cost efficiency, new product offerings and innovation are critical to success. The consumer products markets are particularly mature in North America and are characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to
our most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care. Furthermore, because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers, the Company faces pricing pressure from these customers,
particularly the high-volume retail store customers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. To protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share, the Company has had to increase
expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products. Consequently, the need for on-going cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or product line extensions remain the most
viable path to generating organic top-line growth given the mature nature of most product categories in North American markets. Through its recent acquisitions, the Company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity
of its various manufacturing facilities. This has resulted in higher levels of cash flow.

In the Specialty Products segment, competition within the specialty chemicals and animal nutrition product lines remained intense in 2003 and 2004. Specialty chemicals operates in a competitive environment influenced
by capacity utilization, buyers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs. With respect to the animal nutrition product line, the Company continues to face higher ingredient costs for its line of nutritional supplements under
the MEGALAC brand name, and weathered a poor U.S. dairy economy in 2003, which had a severe impact on the purchasing ability and financial viability of dairymen. To meet these challenges, the Specialty Products business pursued an important business
improvement initiative which was aimed at improving its longer term operational effectiveness and cost structure.

Critical accounting policies

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical
experience, our observance of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our critical accounting policies include:

Promotional and sales returns reserves

The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns
are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons
and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements. All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the related sale is
recognized. Co-op advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company’s products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with
end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product is sold relating to the promotion. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience
to project coupon redemption rates



to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of coupons redeemed over the past couple of years, a 0.1% deviation in the actual rate of
redemptions versus the rate accrued for in the financial statements could result in approximately a $2 million difference in the reserve required. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, we use experience-based estimates,
customer and sales organization inputs, and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company’s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by 10%, the impact to promotional spending
and sales return accruals would be approximately $6.0 million. While we believe that our promotional and sales returns reserves are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ
materially from what will actually transpire in the future. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately $10.2 million based on changes to previous estimates, and in 2003
and 2002 the Company reversed prior year promotion liabilities of approximately $1.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively.

Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment

Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived
intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The Company’s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires
significant judgment with respect to volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment
occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying
value and the net present value of estimated cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as
unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired.

Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance
with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. The Company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. The
analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and
reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to
determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows.

The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the business plans and
estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken. Future
outcomes may also differ. If the Company’s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company’s revenue and cost forecasts
may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. In 2004, the Company recognized tradename impairment, plant impairment and equipment obsolescence charges of approximately $6.7 million, which was
included in the operating results of the Consumer Domestic segment. In 2003 the Company recognized an impairment charge of $2.7 million on manufacturing equipment which was charged to the Consumer Domestic segment. In 2002, the Company recognized
tradename, equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately $6.2 million, which was charged to the Consumer Domestic segment.

Inventory valuation

When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value), including any costs
to sell or dispose. The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires
estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company’s products, technological changes, and new product introductions. The estimates as to the future demand used in the valuation of inventory are dependent on the ongoing success of
the Company’s products. In addition, the Company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the rationalization of the number of stock keeping units (“SKU’s”). The number of SKU’s has been reduced by approximately
27% over the last 2 years. To minimize this risk, the Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to the inventory’s net realizable value were $5.9 million at
December 31, 2004, and $3.2 million at December 31, 2003.

Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs

The Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to our actuaries, including the discount rate and expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions.

The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate
bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the Moody’s AA Corporate Bond Index to select a rate at which we believe the pension
benefits could be effectively settled. Based on the published rates as of December 31, 2004, as well as selected Corporate bonds matching our estimated cash flows of the plans, the Company used a discount rate of 5.75% for the three remaining
domestic plans, a decline of 25 basis points from the 6.00% rate used in 2003. This had the effect of increasing the projected benefit obligation for pensions and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $1.5 million and
$0.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004.



The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a
historical trend based on a 15 year average, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the
Company’s weighted average expected long-term rate of return as of December 31, 2004 is 7.61%, a decline of 111 basis points from the 8.72% rate used at December 31, 2003. This decrease is due to the change in the expected long-term rate of the
Company’s domestic plans from 8.75% to 8.25% and the inclusion of Armkel’s plans. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in less than a $0.4 million change in pension expense for 2005.

On December 31, 2004 the accumulated benefit obligation related to our
pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets (such excess is referred to as an un-funded accumulated benefit obligation). This difference is attributed to (1) an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that resulted from
the decrease in the interest rate used to discount the projected benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from 6.00% to 5.75%, partially offset by (2) the increase in the market value of the plan assets at December 31, 2004. As a result,
in accordance with SFAS No. 87, the Company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of $1.4 million included in benefit obligations, and recorded a charge, net of tax, to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.8 million which
decreased stockholders’ equity. The charge to stockholders’ equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the income statement
impact for 2004 is estimated to be approximately $0.8 million charged to earnings. On a cash basis, an estimated contribution of approximately $5.4 million will be required in 2005.

Tax contingencies

The Company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions. The liabilities relate to tax return
positions, although supportable by the Company, that may be challenged by the tax authorities. The Company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by Courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in
estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations. The Company’s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities. Settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash. Favorable
resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to the Company’s annual tax rate. The IRS is currently examining the Company’s 2002 US Federal Corporation Income Tax Return and, to date, no adjustments have been proposed.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-1,
“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Act). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy
to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The FSP permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a
one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. The Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes reflect the effects of the Act on the postretirement health care plan. The effect of adopting the provisions of this FSP
did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) concluded in EITF Issue 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” that contingently convertible debt (“Co-Cos”) be
treated for diluted EPS purposes as if converted from debt to equity, beginning with the date the contingently convertible debt instrument is initially issued, even if the triggering events (such as stock price) have not yet occurred. The effective
date would be reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2004 and prior period EPS amounts presented for comparative purposes would have to be restated. The Company has implemented this consensus in its 2004 financial statements, which had
the effect of lowering 2004 diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and did not have an effect on 2003 and 2002 earnings per share.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs, an amendment for ARB 43, Chapter 4”. This Statement requires that certain
abnormal costs that were included in inventory pricing such as abnormal costs for idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be treated as current period charges. In addition, this Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during the fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 151 will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”. SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, which
requires recognition of an expense when goods or services are provided. SFAS No. 123R requires the determination of the fair value of the share-based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which
the share-based compensation vests. SFAS No. 123R permits a prospective or two modified versions of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures
required for those periods by the original SFAS No. 123. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R effectively July 1, 2005, at which time the Company will begin recognizing an expense for unvested share-based compensation
that has been issued or will be issued after that date. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption, January 1, 2005 for the Company, or for all periods presented. The Company has
not yet finalized its decision concerning the transition option and measurement methodology it will utilize to adopt SFAS No. 123R, but estimates that the impact will not be materially different than the amounts in its pro forma disclosure.



The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the AJCA) was enacted on October 22, 2004. The AJCA repeals an
export incentive, creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the U.S.

The FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP FAS 109-1) on December 21, 2004. In accordance with FSP FAS 109-1, the Company will treat the
deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, which is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2005, as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign
earnings. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by
segment. The discussion of our segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. The segment discussion also presents certain product line fluctuations. The Company’s reporting
units are consistent with its reportable segments.

Consolidated results

2004 compared to 2003

Net Sales

Net sales increased by $405.2 million or 38.3% to $1,462.1 million, compared to $1,056.9 million in the previous year. The increase is primarily due to
the Armkel acquisition and the oral care business acquisition which contributed sales of $380.4 million in 2004. Also contributing to the increase was the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates of $4.6 million, and $10.2 million resulting from
the reversal of prior year’s promotion reserves due to a change in estimate. The 2003 sales also included $25.2 million generated by the oral care business, which was acquired in fourth quarter and $1.3 million due to the reversal of prior year
promotion adjustments.

Operating Costs

The Company’s gross margin increased to 36.5% from 30.1% in the prior
year. The increase in gross margin is primarily due to the Armkel acquisition and full year effect of the oral care business acquisition. The acquired products carry a higher gross margin than the Company’s existing product lines prior to the
acquisitions. Included in the 2004 gross margin was the impact of a $10.5 million inventory related purchase accounting charge associated with the Armkel acquisition and a $1.5 million plant impairment charge. Gross profit in 2003 included a $5.9
million inventory related purchase accounting charge related to the oral care business acquisition.

Marketing expenses of $161.2 million increased $72.4 million or 81% from 2003. Approximately $62 million of the increase is associated with the acquired
Armkel and oral care brands. Marketing expenses for existing brands increased $10 million primarily in support of Deodorizing and Cleaning products, Personal Care products and new product activity. This increase was partially offset by lower expense
for BRILLO SCRUB’N TOSS, which was introduced in 2003.

Selling, general and administrative expenses of $200.5 million increased $83.1 million or 41% as compared to 2003. This increase is primarily due to approximately $62.0 million associated with the former Armkel business and additional costs
in support of the oral care business acquisition. Other increases include $4 million of severance costs and the termination costs relating to one of the Company’s foreign subsidiary’s pension plan, a $1.9 million tradename impairment
charge, higher performance related compensation costs of $6.4 million, higher Sarbanes-Oxley compliance expenses of $3.7 million, and higher research & development (“R&D”) expenses of $1.7 million (exclusive of costs to support the
acquired Armkel and oral care brands).

Other Income and
Expenses

The decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates
of $13.5 million reflects the consolidation of the Armkel acquisition since May 28, 2004. Included in the Company’s equity earnings from Armkel in 2004 is a $2.5 million tradename impairment charge. The 2003 result benefited from a litigation
settlement, partially offset by an impairment of an asset held for sale, for a net contribution to the Company of approximately $5 million. The combined results of the Company’s other equity investments, Armand Products Company
(“Armand”) and the ArmaKleen Company (“ArmaKleen”), increased by $0.8 million.

Interest expense increased $21.0 million to $ 41.4 million. The increase can be attributed primarily to increased debt that was assumed by the Company as
part of the Armkel acquisition, and new debt required to purchase the remaining interest in Armkel, a $4.9 million third quarter interest payment related to a legal settlement and the full year effect of the debt required to purchase the oral care
business.



Net loss on early extinguishment of debt of $22.9 million includes an $8.0 million charge incurred in the
second quarter of 2004 associated with the Company’s bank debt refinancing to effect the acquisition of Armkel and a $14.9 million charge in the fourth quarter related to the redemption of the Armkel 9 ½% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009
assumed as part of the Armkel acquisition. The charge in 2003 of $4.1 million was associated with the bank debt refinanced to acquire the oral care business.

Investment income was approximately $1.9 million higher than in 2003 as a result of a higher amount of investable cash available and slightly higher
interest rates.

Other income and expense includes the effect
of foreign exchange remeasurement gains related to intercompany loans between the Company’s subsidiaries.

Taxation

The tax rate for 2004 was 30.3% as compared to 30.8% in 2003. This year’s tax rate was favorably impacted by prior year R&D tax credits and other
items of $4.6 million. The 2003 tax rate included a settlement of a state tax matter as well as the resolution of other tax contingencies.

2003 compared to 2002

Net Sales

Net sales increased by $9.8 million or 0.9% to $1,056.9 million, compared to $1,047.1 million in the previous year. The majority of this increase was due
to the additional sales resulting from the fourth quarter acquisition of certain assets of Unilever’s oral care business in the United States and Canada. Other increases included the effects of foreign exchange of approximately $3.0 million and
the reversal of prior period promotion reserves of approximately $1.3 million due to a change in estimate. These increases were partially offset by the Company’s change in revenue recognition policy from FOB shipping point to FOB destination
point, which reduced sales by approximately $6.3 million in 2003. Sales in 2002 included a similar change in promotion estimate of $5.3 million, as well as the discontinuation of certain former USA Detergents cleaners and former Carter-Wallace pet
care products of approximately $8.6 million. The impact of these discontinued products was approximately $1.2 million in 2003.

Operating Costs

The Company’s gross margin increased to 30.1% from 29.7% in the prior year. This increase in gross margin represented a substantial improvement in
the consumer domestic product margin partially offset by a substantial reduction in specialty products margin. The higher consumer products margin was due to the full-year benefits of the integration of certain former Carter-Wallace products
completed in 2002, as well as additional purchasing, manufacturing and distribution efficiencies associated with economies of scale achieved in 2003, partially offset by higher start-up costs and promotion expenses associated with new product
introductions. The lower specialty products margin was primarily due to higher ingredient costs for the animal nutrition business.

Marketing expenses increased $2.6 million to $88.8 million. The increase was primarily associated with advertising expenses for Personal Care products,
namely ARM & HAMMER dentifrice and ARRID brands, as well as the marketing costs associated with the newly introduced cleaning product, BRILLO SCRUB’N TOSS, partially offset by a reduction in advertising expenses for other Personal Care
products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased $3.2 million. This decrease was primarily a result of the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in 2002 associated with the Carter-Wallace products acquired in the fourth quarter of 2001, and tradename impairment charges
recorded in 2002, partially offset by higher personnel related expenses.

Other Income and Expenses

The increase in equity in earnings of affiliates of $7.1 million was almost entirely due to the Company’s pro-rata share in the year over year increase in earnings from Armkel. Armkel’s earnings increase for the year was primarily
a result of a litigation settlement in the second quarter, partially offset by an impairment of an asset held for sale, for a net contribution to the Company of approximately $5 million. This increase over the prior year also reflected a strong
performance by international operations, partially offset by significantly weaker domestic results. Earnings in 2002 reflected the disproportionate recapture of $5 million of allocated losses sustained in the fourth quarter of 2001 in accordance
with the terms of the Armkel joint venture agreement. The prior period increase was also impacted by the inventory step-up charge in the first quarter of 2002 related to Armkel’s opening inventory values. The combined results of the
Company’s other equity investments, Armand and ArmaKleen, were virtually unchanged.

Investment earnings were lower as a result of lower interest rates on funds invested.

Interest expense increased $0.5 million for the year even though there was a significant reduction in average debt outstanding at lower interest rates.
This is because the Company recorded a $4.9 million charge to write off deferred financing costs related to previous financing transactions and settlement of interest rate swaps.

Other income and expense includes foreign exchange gains realized by the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, while 2002 was
unfavorably affected by foreign exchange losses incurred by the same subsidiary.



Taxation

The effective tax rate for the year was 30.8%, compared to 34.0% in the previous year. This decrease is primarily a result of a settlement of a state
tax matter as well as the resolution of other tax contingencies.

Segment
results for 2004, 2003 and 2002

Segment results are
presented based upon segments as described in Note 17 of the notes to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements.

As a result of the Armkel acquisition, the Company has redefined its reportable segments. The Company has identified its reportable segments based on
differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. Specifically, the Company has identified the following segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. The Company also has a Corporate
segment.

Segment revenues are derived from the sale of the
following products:

The Company had a 50
percent ownership interest in the Armand and ArmaKleen partnerships as of December 31, 2004. Since the Company did not control these entities as of December 31, 2004, they were accounted for under the equity method in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its equity in earnings are included in Income Before Taxes and Minority Interest of the Corporate segment.

On May 28, 2004, the Company purchased the remaining 50% of Armkel that it did not own and Armkel was merged into the Company. Operating results for the
former Armkel business have been fully consolidated in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments for results subsequent to May 28, 2004. The Company’s equity in earnings of Armkel’s domestic operations for the period up to
May 28, 2004 are included in Income Before Taxes and Minority Interest of the Consumer Domestic segment, and equity in earnings of Armkel’s international operations for the period up to May 28, 2004 are included in Income Before Taxes and
Minority Interest of the Consumer International segment.

The
following table presents selected financial information relating to the Company’s segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. The Company’s segment presentation for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
have been revised from prior period presentations to conform with the new segments. The segment discussion also presents product line fluctuations.

Consumer Domestic

2004 compared to 2003

Consumer Domestic Net Sales increased $245.0 million to $1,077.1 million for
the year. The increase is largely due to the Armkel and oral care business acquisitions, which contributed an additional $214.9 million in sales, and the reversal of $9.6 million of prior year promotion reserves due to a change in estimate. At the
product line level, after accounting for the effect of the previously mentioned items, net sales of deodorizing and cleaning products rose strongly, laundry products rose slightly and personal care products declined. At the brand level, sales of ARM
& HAMMER and XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, and ARM & HAMMER toothpaste, were all above last year, while sales of laundry detergent powder, fabric softeners and antiperspirants were lower. The trend
of higher liquid laundry detergent and lower powder detergent sales continued in 2004 as an increasing number of consumers switch to the liquid form of the product.



Consumer Domestic Income Before Taxes and Minority Interests increased $23.0 million to $112.7 million in
2004 as compared to $89.7 million in 2003. This is primarily a result of the Armkel and oral care business acquisitions. This increase was negatively impacted by the inventory related purchase accounting charge in 2004 of $8.2 million, a $1.5
million plant impairment charge and a tradename impairment charge of $1.9 million. The results of 2003 include the effect of a $5.9 million inventory related purchase accounting charge. Existing Consumer Domestic products earnings contributions were
slightly higher in 2004 as a result of higher gross profit partially offset by higher marketing in support of Deodorizing and Cleaning products, certain Personal Care products, new product activity and SG&A expenses. The segments earnings from
affiliates was significantly lower than in 2003 as a result of the Armkel acquisition, whose results since May 28, 2004 are included in the segment’s operating results. Interest expense was significantly higher due to the debt required to
purchase Armkel, debt assumed as part of the Armkel acquisition and the full year effect of interest associated with the debt to purchase the oral care business.

2003 compared to 2002

Consumer Domestic Net Sales were essentially unchanged at $832.1 million for the year, which reflected the fourth quarter Unilever acquisition, partially
offset by a change in revenue recognition policy. Major factors that impacted comparative product lines performance included a $1.3 million reversal of prior year promotion reserves due to a change in estimate; net sales in 2002 reflected a similar
change in promotion estimate of $5.3 million. Furthermore, Consumer Domestic Net Sales were also lower due to discontinuation of some former USA Detergents cleaners and former Carter-Wallace pet care products, which impacted the Deodorizing and
Cleaning Products line. Net sales of liquid laundry detergent were significantly higher and more than offset the continuing industry trend of declining powder laundry detergent sales as an increasing number of consumers switched to the liquid form
of the product in the Laundry Products line. Personal Care Products, exclusive of the impact of the oral care business acquisition, were lower in part because of a reduction in gum sales and the discontinued ARM & HAMMER Breathcare line.

Consumer Domestic Income Before Taxes and Minority Interest
increased $15.2 million, or 20.3%, to $89.7 million mostly due to a $9.5 million increase in gross profit with more than half of this increase attributable to the acquired oral care brands. The remainder of the gross profit improvement was the
result of improved Laundry Product margins as well as lower manufacturing costs for ARRID Antiperspirant after the relocation of manufacturing to the Lakewood plant from the former Carter-Wallace Cranbury plant. Higher marketing expenses of $4.1
million were incurred mainly to support the newly introduced Cleaning Product BRILLO SCRUB’N TOSS, as well as by higher advertising costs for ARRID Antiperspirant and ARM & HAMMER Dentifrice, partially offset by lower marketing costs for
the gum line and the discontinued Breathcare line. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.0 million due to the elimination of transition related expenses incurred in 2002 associated with Carter-Wallace products acquired by the
Company in the fourth quarter of 2001. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 reflected tradename impairment charges of $2.3 million. These factors were partially offset by higher personnel related costs. Equity in
Armkel’s earnings increased $2.7 million as a result of a higher gross margin, which was negatively impacted in 2002 by Armkel’s recognition of the remainder of its purchase accounting inventory step up charge and lower selling, general
and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher marketing expenses.

Consumer International

2004 compared to

Consumer International’s Net Sales rose $139.7
million to $176.7 million. This increase includes $138.0 million that was attributable to the former Armkel foreign subsidiaries and $2.4 million associated with favorable foreign exchange rates. Existing product sales were virtually unchanged.

Consumer International Income Before Taxes and Minority
Interest of $15.3 million was $3.7 million or 31.5% higher than in 2003 primarily due to contributions from the former Armkel foreign subsidiaries. Higher operating profit of $9.6 million was partially offset by lower equity in earnings of
affiliates of $3.8 million and an allocation of interest expense. The 2004 results include a $2.3 million inventory related purchase accounting charge relating to the Armkel acquisition and a charge included in SG&A for the termination of a
pension plan.

2003 compared to 2002

Consumer International’s Net Sales of $37.0 million were $5.3 million
or 16.9% higher than 2002. Favorable foreign exchange of $2.9 million and increased export sales of $1.1 million were the main contributors to the higher sales.

Consumer International Income Before Taxes and Minority Interest increased $5.0 million to $11.6 million. The major reason for the increase was higher
equity income from Armkel’s foreign subsidiaries of $4.4 million, which reflected higher sales and gross profit, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher marketing expenses. Favorable exchange rates
also contributed to higher earnings.



Specialty Products

2004 compared to 2003

Specialty Products Net Sales increased $20.4 million or 10.9% to $208.3 million in 2004 due to higher sales of animal nutrition and specialty chemical
products. Also impacting the sales increase was favorable foreign exchange rates of approximately $2.2 million.

Specialty Products Income Before Taxes and Minority Interest of $18.0 million was $1.8 million or 11.1% above last year. This increase is due to higher
gross profit contributions by both animal nutrition and specialty chemical products, partially offset by higher marketing expenses in support of animal nutrition products and a higher amount of allocated interest expense.

2003 compared to 2002

Specialty Products Net Sales grew $4.8 million or 2.6% due to higher
specialty chemicals sales, which included the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates at the Company’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Brazil, partially offset by lower sales of animal nutrition products and the impact from the change
in revenue recognition policy.

Specialty Products Income
Before Taxes and Minority Interest decreased by $0.4 million to $16.2 million for the year. The decrease was mainly a result of a $3.7 million decrease in gross profit due to higher manufacturing costs in certain animal nutrition and specialty
chemical products, particularly a palm oil derivative used in animal nutrition. Offsetting factors were lower marketing expenses of $1.5 million, mostly with respect to the animal nutrition products, combined with flat year over year selling,
general and administrative expenses, and a $0.7 million reduction in interest expense.

Competitive Environment

Many of our competitors are large companies, including The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever, Inc., The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, The Gillette Company, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., Pfizer, Inverness and SSL
International, which have greater financial resources than the Company. These companies have the capacity to outspend the Company in an attempt to gain market share.

Because of the competitive environment facing retailers, the Company faces pricing pressure from these customers,
particularly the high-volume retail store customers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. These concessions or terms could reduce the Company’s margins. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to
maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers, the customers could increase product purchases from our competitors, which would harm the Company’s sales and profitability.

Consumer products, particularly those that are value-priced, such as laundry
and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition. From time to time, the Company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share.

The Company has entered the oral care and personal care and
deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its ARM & HAMMER trademark and baking soda technology. These are highly innovative markets, characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions, and requiring heavy
advertising and promotion.

In the toothpaste category, after
leading its category in growth several years ago, driven by the success of ARM & HAMMER ADVANCE WHITE toothpaste, the Company’s share dropped in both 2002 and 2003 mainly as a result of competitive new products and aggressive spending by
other manufacturers in the category. However in 2004, share increased modestly based upon the introduction of ARM & HAMMER ENAMEL CARE.

Early in 2004, the Company launched ARM & HAMMER ENAMEL CARE toothpaste, its most important oral care innovation in several years. ENAMEL CARE is
based on proprietary formulation and packaging technology which combines the cleaning and whitening properties of baking soda with fluoride and patented liquid calcium in a dual chamber tube to fill tooth surfaces and restore enamel luster. The
product is available in two variants: Advanced Cleaning and Natural Whitening. In 2005, the Company will introduce ARM & HAMMER ENAMEL CARE with Breath Defense, which combines LIQUID CALCIUM technology with additional long-lasting breath
benefits. In addition, the entire ARM & HAMMER toothpaste line has been re-staged with new packaging graphics designed to return the brand to its original emphasis on therapeutic benefits. In 2005, the Company is launching MENTADENT REPLENISHING
WHITE toothpaste with liquid calcium technology to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent stains from forming. Other important personal care initiatives, early in 2004, included additions to the ARM & HAMMER ULTRAMAX antiperspirant line and in
2005, the entire ARRID antiperspirant line will be restaged with improved formulas, fragrances and packaging.

The domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors. The market is divided between premium brands
and price brands, with companies competing on the basis of quality, innovation and price. The major domestic producers are the Company, with its TROJAN, NATURALAMB and CLASS ACT brands, SSL International with its Durex and Avanti brands, and Ansell
with its Lifestyles brand. The Company is the market leader with an approximate 70% share in the U.S. The Company is currently the leading advertiser in the U.S. condom category based on dollars spent. The Company also increased its promotional
programs and has regularly developed new and innovative product line extensions including the very successful introduction of HER PLEASURE in



2002 and TWISTED PLEASURE in 2003. In 2004, the Company added two new products to the TROJAN condom line, SHARED PLEASURE and MAGNUM WITH WARM SENSATION, a
unique lubricant system which warms the skin on contact for advanced pleasure. In 2005, the Company introduced TROJAN MINT TINGLE, a uniquely flavored lubricated condom. In addition, the successful Warming Sensations lubricating system introduced
last year will now be extended to the HER PLEASURE line of TROJAN condoms.

The domestic market for home pregnancy test kits is divided between premium and value brands. The Company markets its FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy kits with a superior “use 5 days before a missed period” claim.
The home pregnancy test kit industry is highly competitive and in 2003 the first digital pregnancy kit was introduced by Inverness

.

In 2004, Pfizer also introduced digital pregnancy kits

.

The major domestic pregnancy test kit producers
are the Company, Pfizer and Inverness

.

The domestic
depilatories and waxes market is highly concentrated with a limited number of competitors. Products compete based on their functionality, innovation and price. The major domestic manufacturers are the Company with its NAIR brand, Del Labs with its
Sally Hansen brand, Reckitt Benckiser with its Veet brand, and Aussie Nads with its Nads wax product. The Company believes that, as a result of its dedicated advertising and promotional programs, distinct packaging and several successful line
extensions, NAIR is positioned to continue to be a major participant in lotion and cream depilatories. In 2004, the Company introduced a “No Touch” line of depilatory products. In 2005, there will be several new additions to the NAIR
depilatory line, including a novel bladeless shaving kit.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company completed the national distribution of ARM & HAMMER EASY FLUSH Clumping Cat Litter, a major new addition to its cat litter line. The Company also repackaged its XTRA Liquid Laundry
Detergent line in vibrant new bottle colors cued to the product’s fragrance variants, and expanded distribution of this product line in the mass channel. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company launched ARM & HAMMER Multi-Cat clumping
cat litter, a superior deodorizing litter designed for the large number of households with two or more cats. Early in 2005, the Company introduced ARM & HAMMER Detergent Plus a Touch of Softener which combines detergent and fabric softener
technologies to meet the need of consumers who want trusted cleaning efficacy with a softening benefit.

Internationally, the Company’s products compete in similar, competitive categories. Some of the Company’s U.S. branded products are also
marketed in other countries, holding leading or number two market share positions. Examples include: TROJAN in Canada and Mexico, and NAIR, in Canada, Mexico, France, Australia, and the U.K., and Spain, where the Company’s depilatory products
are marketed under the TAKY brand name. The Company also has a position in the cosmetic whitening dentifrice segment with its PEARL DROPS brand in the U.K., Australia, Italy, and Germany (under the PERLWEISS brand), as well as in France (where the
Company’s products are marketed as EMAIL DIAMANT).

The
Company markets home pregnancy test kits in many countries, under such brand names as FIRST RESPONSE, DISCOVER, CONFIDELLE, and ANSWER. This category has been negatively affected in international markets by the introduction of many lower-priced and
private label products, but the Company has seen some growth for its business recently as it has rolled out the “use 3 days before a missed period” claim first used domestically.

In the skin care category the Company markets such brands as LINEANCE and
BARBARA GOULD in France, the former for anti-cellulite and general body care and the latter for facial care. In Spain, the Company markets EUDERMIN hand care cream, in the mass market class of trade, where it has a number two position. Recently this
line has been expanded to include body and foot care products.

In various countries the Company also markets OTC pharmaceutical products. These include GRAVOL and OVOL, the leading anti-nauseant and anti-gas brands in Canada, the PANGAVIT range of vitamin supplements in Mexico, STERIMAR, a sea-water
nasal hygiene product sold primarily in France, but also in about fifty other countries, including most recently Mexico.

In the Specialty Products business, competition remained intense especially in the buffer segment of the animal nutrition business. Potassium carbonate
was negatively impacted by the excess capacity caused by the departure of the U.S. video glass industry, which migrated to lower cost regions of the world.

During 2004, the Company continued to pursue opportunities to build a specialized industrial cleaning business using our aqueous-based technology. In
early 1999, the Company extended its alliance with Safety-Kleen Corp. to build a specialty cleaning products business based on our technology and their sales and distribution organization. The second year of this alliance was impacted by
Safety-Kleen’s financial difficulties leading to a Chapter 11 filing in June of 2000, and a major reorganization implemented during the second half of that year. Safety-Kleen Corp. emerged from bankruptcy in 2003. While this opportunity has
demonstrated more stability in 2004 and continues to hold great promise, the outcome will not be known for some time.



Liquidity and capital resources

Debt

The Company had outstanding total debt of $858.7 million and cash of $145.5 million (of which $56.5 million resides in foreign subsidiaries). Total debt
less cash (“Net debt”) was $713.2 million at December 31, 2004. The Company had outstanding total debt of $397.0 million, and cash of $75.6 million, resulting in net debt of $321.4 million at December 31, 2003.

During the first quarter of 2003, the Company entered into a receivables
purchase agreement with an issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper in order to refinance a portion, $60.0 million, of its primary credit facility. Under this arrangement, the Company sold, and will sell from time to time, throughout the
three-year term of the agreement, its trade accounts receivable to a wholly-owned, consolidated, special purpose finance subsidiary, Harrison Street Funding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Harrison”). Harrison in turn sold, and
will sell on an ongoing basis, to the commercial paper issuer an undivided interest in the pool of accounts receivable. The receivables assets and the short-term borrowings of Harrison are included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company. The transactions were entered into to reduce certain expenses associated with the credit facility in addition to lowering the Company’s financing costs by accessing the commercial paper market. During July 2004, as a result of
purchasing Kelso’s interest in Armkel, the Company amended its accounts receivable securitization agreement to increase the capacity that can be borrowed from $60 million to the current $100 million. The balance outstanding under the agreement
on December 31, 2004 was $93.7 million. The proceeds of the increased borrowing were used to make a voluntary Term A Loan payment on August 4, 2004.

In August of 2003, the Company issued $100 million principal amount of 5.25% convertible senior debentures due August 15, 2033 through a private placement
to qualified institutional buyers. The debentures rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The debentures are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the
Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness and to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company has
the right to redeem all or part of the debentures on or after August 15, 2008. Interest is paid semi-annually on August 15th and February 15th of each year.

On each of August 15, 2010, August 15, 2013, August 15, 2018, August 15, 2023 and August 15, 2028, or in the event of a change in control, holders may
require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the debentures at a purchase price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Company must pay cash for any
debentures repurchased on August 15, 2010. However, the Company may choose to pay cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash or shares of its common stock for any debentures repurchased on August 15, 2013, August 15, 2018, August 15,
2023 or August 15, 2028 or following a change in control.

Holders may convert their debentures into shares of the Company’s common stock prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 32.26 shares of common stock per each $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to a conversion
price of approximately $31.00 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. A holder may convert the debentures into the Company’s common stock under the following circumstances: during any conversion period prior to August 15,
2032, if the sale price of the Company’s common stock is more than 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the first day of that conversion period (the “20% conversion
price premium”); the trading price of a debenture falls below a specified threshold; specified credit rating events with respect to the debentures occur; the Company calls the debentures for redemption; or specified corporate transactions
occur.

Because of the inclusion of the restricted
convertibility feature of the debentures, the Company’s diluted net income per common share calculation effective for periods ending before December 15, 2004 did not account for the effect to the dilution from the conversion of the debentures
until the Company’s share price exceeded the 20% conversion price premium or one of the other events described above occurs. However, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) concluded in EITF Issue 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” that contingently convertible debt (“Co-Cos”) be treated for diluted earnings per share purposes as if converted from debt to equity, beginning with the date the contingently
convertible debt instrument is initially issued, even if the triggering events (such as stock price) have not yet occurred, and prior period EPS amounts presented for comparative purposes would have to be restated. The Company has implemented this
consensus in its 2004 financial statements, which had the effect of lowering 2004 diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and did not have an effect on 2003 and 2002 earnings per share.

In conjunction with the Armkel acquisition, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the
“Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Fleet National Bank and National City Bank, each as a documentation agent, Citicorp North America, Inc., as syndication agent, and J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a five year term loan in a principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Term A Loan”), (ii) a seven year term loan in the principal amount of $440.0 million,
which term loan may be increased by up to an additional $250.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the “Term B Loan,” and together with the Term A Loan, the “Term Loans”), and (iii) a five year multi-currency
revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Loans”), $94.0 million of which was undrawn at December 31, 2004. The Term Loans were used to finance the acquisition
of the remaining 50% interest in Armkel not previously owned by the Company, pay amounts outstanding under Armkel’s principal credit facility of approximately $136.0 million and refinance the Company’s principal credit facility of
approximately $194.0 million. The Revolving Loans are available for general corporate purposes. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic
subsidiaries. Those domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the loan obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Term Loans and the Revolving Loans bear interest under one of two rate options, selected by the Company, equal to (a) either (i) a
eurocurrency rate (adjusted for any reserve requirements) (“Eurocurrency Rate”) or (ii) the greater of the



prime rate, the secondary market rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for any reserve requirements) plus the applicable FDIC assessment
rate plus 1.0%, or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% (“Alternate Base Rate”), plus (b) an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by the Company’s current leverage ratio. At the closing date of the Credit
Agreement, the applicable margin was (a) 1.75% for the Eurocurrency Rate and (b) 0.75% for the Alternate Base Rate.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company issued $250 million of 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due December 15, 2012 through a private placement. In
conjunction with the placement, the Company effected a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the outstanding Armkel 9 ½% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 that it assumed as part of the acquisition. It was determined
that the price to be paid for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered and accepted for payment (including a consent payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes) was $1,086.80, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date. Of
the outstanding balance of $225 million, $218.6 million was purchased by the Company. As a result, the Company incurred a fourth quarter net loss on early extinguishment of debt charge of $14.9 million (which included the write-off of existing
deferred financing costs and prepayment penalty).

As noted
above, on December 22, 2004, the Company issued $250 million of 6.0% senior subordinated notes due December 15, 2012 (“Notes”) with interest paid semi-annually. The Notes were issued at par and the Company received $225 million of proceeds
that were used to redeem $218.6 million of the Armkel notes and the balance was used to make voluntary bank debt repayments. The notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by substantially all of the Company’s existing and future
domestic subsidiaries whose annual revenues (other than intercompany revenues) or total assets (other than intercompany receivables) are $100,000 or more. The notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time on
or after December 15, 2008, at pre determined redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. The notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time prior to
December 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium. At any time prior to December 15, 2007, the Company may redeem up to 35%
of the original principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional notes issued under the same indenture) with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings of the Company’s capital stock at a redemption
price of 106.0% of the principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

The terms of the subordinated note and credit agreement place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments the Company can make. This limitation
includes the amount the Company can pay in dividends on its common stock. As long as the Company is not in default under either agreement, the limitation ( which is a percentage of net income relative to the Company’s consolidated leverage
ratio) is such that the Company does not currently anticipate having an effect on its ability to pay dividends at its current rate.

In addition, QGN has lines of credit which allow it to borrow in its local currency. This amounts to $7 million, of which approximately $3 million was
utilized as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 18% and 15.3%, respectively; QGN’s long-term debt is at various interest rates that are determined
by several local inflation indexes.

Adjusted EBITDA is a
required component of the financial covenants contained in the Company’s primary credit facility and Senior Subordinated Notes. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors as a financial indicator of the
Company’s ability to service its indebtedness. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Financial covenants include a total debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, which, if not met, could result in an event of default and
trigger the early termination of the credit facility and notes, if not remedied within a certain period of time. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the notes are not materially different than that of the credit agreement.

Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $287.0 million for 2004. The leverage ratio
(total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) for the twelve months December 31, 2004 which, under the credit agreement, permitted the inclusion of Armkel’s EBITDA prior to its acquisition by the Company for pro forma purposes, was 2.96 versus the
agreement’s maximum 4.25, and the interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense) was 5.3 versus the agreement’s minimum of 3.0. This credit agreement is secured by the assets of the Company and certain domestic
subsidiaries. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in millions):



Cash flow from operating activities

In 2004, cash flow from operating activities was $194.9 million. Major factors affecting cash flow from operating activities
included operating earnings before non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and disposal and write-down of assets, the write-off of deferred financing costs and a decrease in working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents). Operating
cash flow, together with an increase in bank debt, the issuance of the Notes, distributions from affiliates, proceeds from stock option exercises and existing cash, were used to fund the purchase of Kelso’s interest in Armkel, make additions to
property, plant and equipment, and pay dividends and debt repayments, including the tender of the Armkel Notes.

During 2003, cash flow from operating activities was $117.9 million. Major factors contributing to the cash flow from operating activities included
operating earnings before non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, a decrease in working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) partially offset by the net non-cash impact from the equity in earnings of affiliates. Operating cash
flow together with new bank borrowing activity, the issuance of convertible debt and proceeds obtained through a receivables purchase agreement described above, were used to fund the investing activities to acquire certain assets of Unilever’s
oral care business in the United States and Canada, and to pay for additions to property, plant and equipment. Remaining cash was used to make both voluntary and mandatory debt repayments, and the proceeds from stock options exercised helped to pay
cash dividends.

Commitments as of December 31, 2004

The table below summarizes the Company’s material
contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004.

(1)

Represents interest on the Company’s 5.25% senior convertible debentures due 2033, interest on the 6% senior subordinated notes due in 2012 and interest on $6.4 million of


/


% Armkel notes due in 2009.

(2)

Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for such things as insurance claims in the event of the Company’s insolvency, one year of lease payments on a warehouse,
and 200 days of interest on the Industrial Revenue Bond borrowing.

(3)

Guarantees represent minimum performance based payment obligations in connection with the oral care business acquisition and the New Jersey Department of Enviromental Protection for
estimated remediation costs at its Cranbury, New Jersey facility.

(4)

Surety/performance bonds were established for construction of the Company’s headquarters addition in Princeton, NJ and for construction activities at the Company’s North
Brunswick, NJ plant.

(5)

The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2004 for raw, packaging and other materials in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation
amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and do not represent total anticipated purchases.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.



Financial Condition

The Company generally relies on operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings to meet its financing requirements. Our
broad product portfolio, strong brand names and market positions have provided a stable base of cash flow. Its broad product line is marketed through multiple distribution channels. The Company believes that, as is the case with other basic consumer
products, consumers purchase most of its products largely independent of economic cycles. However, the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations depends on successful financial and operating performance. The Company cannot guarantee
that its business strategy will succeed or that it will achieve the anticipated financial results. The Company’s financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors
include:

•

Competitive conditions in the categories of the consumer products industry in which the Company competes;

•

The Company’s ability to retain certain principal customers, such as Wal-Mart;

•

Operating difficulties, operating costs or pricing pressures the Company may experience;

•

Passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that affect the Company adversely;

•

Delays in implementing any strategic projects; and

•

Current geo-political events.

The Company cannot give assurance that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that it will be able to obtain sufficient funding to
satisfy all its obligations, including those noted above. If the Company is unable to pay its obligations, it will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring indebtedness or raising
additional equity capital. However, the Company cannot give assurance that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate to satisfy its obligation.

The Company has a total debt-to-capital ratio of approximately 61%. At December 31, 2004 the Company had approximately $94.0
million of additional domestic borrowing capacity available through the revolving loans under its Credit Agreement. Management believes that operating cash flow, coupled with the Company’s access to credit markets, will be sufficient to meet
the anticipated cash requirements for the coming year.

On July
2, 2004, the Company announced that it had agreed to invest $30 million in a company formed by Kelso & Company to acquire Del Laboratories, Inc. The Company’s investment was to be substantially in the form of convertible preferred stock,
and would have represented about 20% of the equity financing. Kelso & Company was to provide the remaining equity, with the participation of Del’s existing management team. On December 6, 2004, the Company and Kelso agreed that the Company
would not have to proceed with its participation in the transaction and the Company was released from its obligation to invest.

OTHER ITEMS

Market risk

Concentration of Risk

A group of three
Consumer Domestic customers accounted for approximately 26% of consolidated net sales in 2004, including a single customer, Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 18%. A group of three Consumer Domestic customers accounted for approximately 26%
of consolidated net sales in 2003, including Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 17%. A group of three Consumer Domestic customers accounted for approximately 23% of consolidated net sales in 2002, including Wal-Mart, which accounted for
approximately 16%.

As part of the USA Detergents merger
agreement in 2001, the Company divested USA Detergents non-laundry business and other non-core assets to former USA Detergents executives under the new company name of USA Metro, Inc. (“USAM”), subsequently renamed USA Detergents
(“USAD”). The Company had a concentration of risk with USAD at December 31, 2004 in the form of trade accounts receivable and an amount due for leased space of approximately $2.8 million and approximately $3.2 million at December 31, 2003,
a $0.4 million equity interest in USAD and a note receivable for other assets of $2.0 million (repayments start in 2006). This note has a carrying value of approximately $1.4 million using an effective interest rate of 17%.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company has total debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 of $858.7
million, of which $356.6 million or 42% carries a fixed rate of interest. The remaining debt balance is comprised of $540 million in Term Loans under the Credit Agreement (which may be increased by $250 million upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions), of which $400.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004; and $100.0 million under the revolving facility under the Credit Agreement, $94.0 million of which was un-drawn at December 31, 2004. The Company entered into a
receivables purchase agreement with the issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper in order to refinance a portion of its primary borrowing facility, and subsequently increased this facility as a result of the Armkel acquisition. The balance
outstanding under this agreement was $93.7 million at December 31, 2004. The weighted average interest rate on all these borrowings at December 31, 2004, excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees, was approximately 4.6%.

The Company’s domestic operations and its Brazilian subsidiary have
other short and long-term debts that are floating rate obligations. If the floating rate were to change by 10% from the December 31, 2004 level, annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would be immaterial.



Foreign Currency

The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S.
Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar and U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real.

As a result of the Armkel acquisition, the Company assumed intercompany loans with certain of its subsidiaries. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange
accounting remeasurement gains and losses from these intercompany loans. The Company has entered into several foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net accounting remeasurement exposure on these loans. At December 31, 2004, the Company hedged 9.7
million Euros, which is approximately 65% of the Euro debt position, with an average rate of 1.36 U.S. dollars per Euro. The Company hedged 30.0 million Mexican Pesos, which is approximately 49% of the Peso debt position, with a rate of 0.0893 U.S.
dollars per peso. The Company had 4.9 million Australian Dollars, which is approximately 55% of the Australian Dollar debt position, with an average rate of 0.78 U.S. dollars per Australian dollars. The terms of these contracts are for periods of
under twelve months. The purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflows or outflows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These
contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and are marked to market in Other Expenses in the Company’s Income Statement.

The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales or purchases denominated in the
Canadian dollar, the British pound and the Euro. There were no material contracts at December 31, 2004 to hedge these transactions and the Company had no outstanding contracts at December 31, 2003.

The Company is also subject to translation exposure of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements. A hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar to the currencies noted above at December 31, 2004 and 2003 would result in an annual currency translation gain or loss of
approximately $1.0 million in 2004 and $0.5 million in 2003.

Equity Derivatives

The Company has entered
into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in the market price of shares in the Company’s deferred compensation plan. These contracts, which consist of cash settled
call options in the amount of 277,500 shares, were in excess of the amount of shares related to the plan and are marked to market through earnings. The over hedge position is a result of plan participant changes in investment elections during the
term of the current hedge contracts. Assuming no material change in the amount of outstanding shares in the plan, the Company will not renew certain contracts. As a result of these contracts, the Company recognized income of approximately $2.1
million in 2004, $1.5 million in 2003, and $0.4 million in 2002, which reduced the charge for deferred compensation.

Related Party Transactions

Prior to the Armkel acquisition, the Company achieved substantial synergies by combining certain of its operations with those of Armkel, particularly in
the areas of sales, manufacturing and distribution, and most service functions. Armkel retained its core marketing, research & development, and financial planning capabilities, and manufactured condoms, but purchased virtually all the support
services it required for its U.S. domestic business from the Company under a management services agreement.

For the five months ended May 28, 2004, the Company invoiced Armkel $10.2 million for administrative and management oversight services (which is included
as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses), purchased $0.8 million of deodorant anti-perspirant inventory produced by Armkel in the first five months of 2004 and sold Armkel $0.7 million of ARM & HAMMER products to be sold
in international markets.

During 2003, the Company invoiced
Armkel $24.4 million for administrative services, purchased $1.9 million of deodorant anti-perspirant inventory produced by Armkel at its cost and sold $2.9 million of ARM & HAMMER products that were sold in international markets. The Company
had an open receivable from Armkel at December 31, 2003 of approximately $6.7 million that primarily related to administrative services.

As noted in “ Concentration of risk” above, the Company divested the USA Detergents non-laundry business and other non-core assets to former USA
Detergents executives in connection with the acquisition of USA Detergents. The Company has a $0.4 million ownership interest in USAD. The Company supplies USAD with certain laundry and cleaning products it produces to meet the needs of USAD’s
markets at cost plus a mark-up. In addition, the Company leases manufacturing and office space to USAD under a separate agreement.

During 2004 and 2003, the Company sold $24.9 million, and $21.8 million, respectively, of laundry and cleaning products to USAD. Furthermore, the Company
billed USAD $0.3 million and USAD billed the Company $0.3 million for leased space. For open amounts receivable at December 31, 2004 and 2003, see “Concentration of risk.”

The Company’s only financial interest in Armkel, prior to its acquisition of Kelso’s interest in Armkel, and in
USAD has been the Company’s direct equity investments in Armkel and USAD. The Company has no relationship with the other former equity holders of Armkel and the equity holders of USAD. For this reason, the Company believes it has had no
incentive to negotiate with either Armkel or USAD in a manner that is not in the best interests of its stockholders generally.



In connection with its Armand and ArmaKleen joint ventures and its partnership with a supplier of sodium
raw materials, the Company believes it has no incentive to negotiate with any of those entities in a manner that is not in the best interests of stockholders generally, since it has no equity interest in the other partners. The Company has entered
into agreements with these entities within the ordinary course of business.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Church & Dwight Co., Inc (the “Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the framework established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte
& Touche LLP, have audited management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Their opinion on management’s assessment and their opinions on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and on the Company’s financial statements appear on pages 33 and 34 of this annual report on Form 10-K.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Princeton, New Jersey

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Church & Dwight Co., Inc.
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of their operations and their cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 4, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Princeton, New Jersey

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Church & Dwight Co., Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and
our report dated March 4, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Accounting Policies

Business

The Company develops, manufactures and markets a broad
range of consumer and specialty products. It sells its products, primarily under the ARM & HAMMER and TROJAN brand names, to consumers through supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers; and to industrial customers and distributors.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. The Company accounts for equity
investments on the cost method for those investments in which it does not control nor have the ability to exert significant influence over the investee, which is generally when the Company has less than a 20 percent ownership interest. In
circumstances where the Company has greater than a 20 percent ownership interest and has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control the investee, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. As a result, the
Company accounts for its less than 20% interest in USA Metro, Inc. on the cost basis and accounts for its 50% interest in its Armand Products Company joint venture (“Armand”) and the ArmaKleen Company joint venture (“ArmaKleen”)
under the equity method of accounting. Both Armand and ArmaKleen companies are specialty chemical companies and the Company’s portion of their equity earnings is included in the corporate segment in Note 17. Neither company is considered a
significant subsidiary; therefore, summarized financial statement data is not presented. On May 28, 2004, the Company purchased the remaining 50% ownership interest of Armkel, LLC (“Armkel”) that it did not own from affiliates of Kelso
& Company (“the Armkel acquisition”) for a purchase price of $262 million and Armkel was merged into the Company. Results of operations for the business are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from May 29,
2004. Prior to May 28, 2004, the Company accounted for its investment in Armkel under the equity method. All material intercompany transactions and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.

Fiscal Calendar

The Company’s fiscal year begins on January 1 of the year stated and
ends on December 31. Quarterly periods are based on a 4-4-5 methodology (4 weeks-4 weeks-5 weeks). As a result, the first quarter can include a partial or expanded week in the first four week period of the quarter. Similarly, the last five week
period in the fourth quarter could include a partial or expanded week.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the
financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes estimates regarding inventory valuation, promotional and sales returns reserves, the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible
assets, the realization of deferred tax assets, tax reserves, liabilities related to pensions and other postretirement benefit obligations and other matters that affect the reported amounts and other disclosures in the financial statements.
Estimates by their nature are based on judgment and available information. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates, and it is possible that changes in such estimates could occur in the near term.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when finished goods are delivered to our customers or
when finished goods are picked up by a customer’s carrier.

Promotional and Sales Returns Reserves

The
Company conducts extensive promotional activities, primarily through the use of off-list discounts, slotting, co-op advertising, periodic price reduction arrangements, and end-aisle and other in-store display. All such costs are netted against
sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the related sale is recognized. Co-op advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company’s products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded
when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product is sold relating to the promotion. The reserves for sales returns and consumer and trade promotion liabilities are established
based on the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing obligations for such items on products sold as of the balance sheet date. The Company uses historical trend experience and coupon redemption provider
input in arriving at coupon reserve requirements, and forecasted appropriations, customer and sales organization inputs, and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required for other promotional activities and sales returns. While the
Company believes that promotional and sales returns reserves are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from actual costs incurred in the future.



Cost of Sales, Marketing and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Cost of sales includes costs related to the manufacture of the
Company’s products (including raw material costs, inbound freight costs, direct labor, and indirect plant costs such as plant supervision, receiving, inspection, maintenance labor and materials, depreciation, taxes and insurance), purchasing,
production planning, operations management, logistics, freight to customers, warehousing costs and internal transfer freight costs.

Marketing expenses include costs for advertising (excluding the costs of co-op advertising programs, which are reflected in net sales), costs for coupon
insertion (mainly the cost of printing and distribution), consumer promotion costs (such as on-shelf advertisements and floor ads), public relations, package design expense and market research costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs related to
functions such as sales, corporate management, marketing administration and legal, among others. Such costs include compensation related costs (such as benefits, profit sharing, deferred compensation and employer contributions to the 401K savings
plan); travel and entertainment related expenses; trade show expenses; insurance; professional and other consulting fees; costs related to temporary staff; staff relocation costs; and non-capitalizable software related costs.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In such situations, long-lived assets are considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the asset’s carrying amount. While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its
estimates. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present
value of estimated future cash flows.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries
are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions were
recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of
highly liquid short-term investments, which mature within three months of purchase.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Approximately 31% and 45% of the inventory at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were determined utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of substantially all
inventory in the Company’s Specialty Products segment as well as inventory sold under the ARM & HAMMER and BRILLO trademarks in the Consumer Domestic segment is determined utilizing the LIFO method. The cost of the remaining inventory is
determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value), including any costs to sell or dispose the adjusted
inventory. The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is indicated. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates
and assumptions about the future demand for the Company’s products, technological changes, and new product introductions. The estimates as to the future demand used in the valuation of inventory are dependent on the ongoing success of the
Company’s products. In addition, the Company’s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the rationalization of the number of stock keeping units. To minimize this risk, the Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on
a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to reduce the inventory’s net realizable value were $5.9 million at December 31, 2004, and $3.2 million at December 31, 2003.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment and additions thereto are stated at cost.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Estimated useful lives for building and improvements, machinery and equipment, and office equipment range from 9-40, 3-20, and 3-10
years, respectively. Routine repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lease term, except when the lease renewal has been determined to be reasonably assured and failure to renew the lease
imposes a penalty on the Company.



Property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. The Company’s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. The analysis
requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews
business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine
the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows.

Software

The Company accounts for software in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1 “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use.” SOP 98-1 requires companies to capitalize certain costs of developing computer software. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, which is estimated to
be 5 years.

Long-Term Supply Contracts

Long-term supply contracts represent advance payments made by the Company
under multi-year contracts with suppliers of raw materials and finished goods inventory. Such advance payments are applied over the lives of the contracts using the straight-line method.

Derivatives

All derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivatives designated as hedges are either (1) a hedge of the fair value of
a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), or (2) a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge).

•

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to
the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.

•

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows of the hedged asset or liability. Any ineffectiveness related to these hedges is recorded directly in earnings. The amount of the ineffectiveness was not material.

•

Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated or qualifying as an accounting hedge are recorded directly to earnings.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in accordance
with SFAS No. 142. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful
lives using the straight-line method.

Research and
Development

Research & development costs in the
amount of $33.0 million in 2004, $26.9 million in 2003 and $26.9 million in 2002 were charged to operations as incurred.

Earnings Per Share

Basic EPS is calculated based on income available to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reported period.
Diluted EPS includes additional dilution to the Company’s earnings from common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding and effective after December 15, 2004, and the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt
instruments (see below).

In August 2003, the Company issued
$100 million of 5.25% convertible senior debentures that may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock prior to maturity, currently at a conversion price of approximately $31.00 per share, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) concluded in EITF Issue 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” that contingently convertible debt (“Co-Cos”) be treated for diluted
EPS purposes as if converted from debt to equity, beginning with the date the contingently convertible debt instrument is initially issued, even if the triggering events (such as stock price) have not yet occurred. The Company has implemented this
consensus in its 2004 financial statements, which had the effect of lowering 2004 diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and did not have an effect on 2003 and 2002 earnings per share.



The following table reflects the components of common shares outstanding for each of the three years
ended December 31, 2004 in accordance with SFAS No. 128:

On August 6, 2004, the
Company announced a 3 for 2 stock split. The shares from the stock split were distributed on September 1, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 16, 2004. All share and per share information in this report reflects the
impact of the stock split.

Employee Stock Based
Compensation

The Company accounts for costs of
stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” rather than the fair-value based method in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” In connection with the Armkel acquisition, the Company paid cash and issued options to purchase 97,500 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $22.88 per share to certain executives
under Armkel’s Equity Appreciation Rights Plan (“EAR Plan”). The unvested portion of the EAR Plan options is being amortized over a two year vesting period and is recognized as expense as vesting occurs. In 2004, the amount recognized
as expense for the stock options granted under the EAR Plan was approximately $0.4 million. The Company recognized compensation expense (net of tax) of approximately $0 in 2003 and $0.5 million in 2002, respectively, in accordance with APB 25. Had
compensation cost been determined based on the fair values of the stock options at the date of grant in accordance with SFAS 123, the Company would have recognized additional compensation expense, net of taxes, of $4.3 million, $3.9 million and $4.5
million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and the Company’s pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been as follows:

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income consists of net income,
foreign currency translation adjustments, changes in the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, and minimum pension liability adjustments, and is presented in the Consolidated Statements
of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and in note 14.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred
income taxes under the liability method; accordingly, deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the future consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
Management provides valuation allowances against the deferred tax asset for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized. The Company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in
various tax jurisdictions. The liabilities relate to tax return positions, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities. The Company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation,
interpretations of laws by Courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations. The Company’s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities. Settlement of
any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash. Favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company’s 2002 US Federal
Corporation Income Tax Return.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB
Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (the Act). The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part
D) as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The FSP permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a
prescription drug benefit to



make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Act. The Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes reflect the effects
of the Act on the postretirement health care plan. The effect of adopting the provisions of this FSP did not have a material effect to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2003, the Company issued $100 million of 5.25% convertible senior
debentures that may be converted into shares of the Company’s common stock prior to maturity, currently at a conversion price of approximately $31.00 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Because of the inclusion of the
contingent convertibility feature of the debentures, the Company’s diluted net income per common share does not currently give effect to the dilution from the conversion of the debentures until the Company’s share price exceeds 120% of the
conversion price or until the occurrence of certain specified events. However, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) concluded in EITF Issue 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” that
contingently convertible debt (“Co-Cos”) be treated for diluted EPS purposes as if converted from debt to equity, beginning with the date the contingently convertible debt instrument is initially issued, even if the triggering events (such
as stock price) have not yet occurred. The effective date would be reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2004 and prior period EPS amounts presented for comparative purposes would have to be restated. The Company has implemented this
consensus in its 2004 financial statements, which had the effect of lowering 2004 diluted earnings per share by $0.01 and did not have an effect on 2003 and 2002 earnings per share.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151 “Inventory Costs, an amendment for ARB. 43, Chapter 4”. This
Statement requires that certain abnormal costs that were included in inventory pricing such as abnormal costs for idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be treated as current period charges. In addition, this
Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions of this Statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during the
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 151 will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”. SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB
Opinion No. 25, which requires recognition of an expense when goods or services are provided. SFAS No. 123R requires the determination of the fair value of the share-based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense
over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. SFAS No. 123R permits a prospective or two modified versions of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro
forma disclosures required for those periods by the original SFAS No. 123. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123 R effectively July 1, 2005, at which time the Company will begin recognizing an expense for unvested
share-based compensation that has been issued or will be issued after that date. Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption, January 1, 2005 for the Company, or for all periods
presented. The Company has not yet finalized its decision concerning the transition option and measurement methodology it will utilize to adopt SFAS No. 123R, but estimates that the impact will not be materially different than the amounts shown in
its pro forma disclosure.

The American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the AJCA) was enacted on October 22, 2004. The AJCA repeals an export incentive, creates a new deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings repatriated
to the U.S.

The FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1, “Application
of FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes,

to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (FSP FAS 109-1) on December 21, 2004. In accordance with FSP FAS 109-1,
the Company will treat the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing activities, which is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2005, as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,” allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the AJCA on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign
earnings. The Company is in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision.

Reclassification

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform with the current year presentation.



2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Risk Management

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of the Company’s financial instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, “Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.

The following methods
and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Note Receivable

The carrying value of the note receivable represents the face value discounted by an interest factor management believes appropriate for the credit risk
involved at the date of the note. The fair value of the note receivable reflects what management believes is the appropriate interest factor at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, based on similar risks in the market.

Short-term Borrowings

The carrying amounts of unsecured lines of credit equal fair value because
of short maturities and variable interest rates.

Long-term
Bank Debt, Current Portion of Long-term Debt and Senior Subordinated Note Debt

The Company determines fair value based upon prevailing value of equivalent financing.

Convertible Debt

The Company determines fair value of its convertible debentures based upon the debentures’ quoted market value.

Interest Rate Swap Contracts

Carrying amounts of interest rate swap contracts are reflected on the
Company’s balance sheet at their fair value. The fair values are estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company has total debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 of $858.7
million, of which $356.6 million or 42% carries a fixed rate of interest. The remaining debt balance is comprised of $540 million in Term Loans under the Credit Agreement (which may be increased by $250 million upon the satisfaction of certain
conditions) of which $400.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004; and $100.0 million under the revolving facility under the Credit Agreement, $94.0 million of which was un-drawn at December 31, 2004. The Company entered into a receivables
purchase agreement with the issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper in order to refinance a portion of its primary borrowing facility, and subsequently increased this facility as a result of the Armkel acquisition. The balance outstanding
under this agreement was $93.7 million at December 31, 2004. The weighted average interest rate on all these borrowings at December 31, 2004, excluding deferred financing costs and commitment fees, was approximately 4.6%.

The Company’s domestic operations and its Brazilian subsidiary have
other short and long-term debts that are floating rate obligations. If the floating rate were to change by 10% from the December 31, 2004 level, additional annual interest expense associated with the floating rate debt would be immaterial.



Foreign Currency

The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S.
Dollar/ British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar and U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real.

As a result of the Armkel acquisition, the Company assumed intercompany loans with certain of its subsidiaries. The Company is exposed to foreign exchange
accounting remeasurement gains and losses from these intercompany loans. The Company has entered into several foreign exchange contracts to hedge the net accounting remeasurement exposure on these loans. At December 31, 2004, the Company hedged 9.7
million Euro’s, which is approximately 65% of the Euro debt position, with an average rate of 1.36 U.S. dollars per Euro. The Company hedged 30.0 million Mexican Peso’s, which is approximately 49% of the Peso debt position, with a rate of
0.0893 U.S. dollars per peso. The Company had 4.9 million Australian Dollars, which is approximately 55% of the Australian Dollar debt position, with an average rate of 0.78 U.S. dollars per Australian dollars. The terms of these contracts are for
periods of under twelve months. The purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflows or outflows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange
rates. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and are marked to market in Other Expenses in the Company’s Income Statement.

The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated but not yet committed sales or
purchases denominated in the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the Euro. There were no material contracts at December 31, 2004 to hedge these transactions and the Company had no outstanding contracts at December 31, 2003.

The Company is also subject to translation exposure of the Company’s
foreign subsidiary’s financial statements. A hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar to the currencies noted above at December 31, 2004 and 2003 would result in an annual currency translation gain or loss of
approximately $1.0 million in 2004 and $0.5 million in 2003.

Equity Derivatives

The Company has entered
into equity derivative contracts of its own stock in order to minimize the impact on earnings resulting from fluctuations in market price of shares in the Company’s deferred compensation plan. These contracts, which consist of cash settled call
options in the amount of 277,500 shares, which was in excess of the amount of shares related to the plan and are marked to market through earnings. The over hedge position is a result of plan participant change in investment elections during the
term of the current hedge contracts. Assuming no material change in the amount of outstanding shares in the Plan, the Company will not renew certain contracts. As a result of these contracts, the Company recognized income of approximately $2.1
million in 2004, $1.5 million in 2003, and $0.4 million in 2002, which reduced the charge for deferred compensation.

3. Inventories

Inventories are summarized as follows:

Inventories valued on
the LIFO method totaled $46.7 million and $38.1 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and would have been approximately $3.1 million and $2.9 million higher, respectively, had they been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

4. Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:



Depreciation, depletion and amortization of property, plant and equipment amounted to $29.9 million,
$23.8 million and $22.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest charges in the amount of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million were capitalized in connection with construction projects in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a
plant impairment charge of $1.5 million, which was recorded as cost of sales in the Consumer Domestic segment, as the value could not be supported by projected cash flows. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company wrote-off approximately $1.8
million of manufacturing equipment removed from service that was charged to cost of sales in the Consumer Domestic segment. Also during the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company made available for sale a small foreign manufacturing facility and wrote
the carrying value down by $0.8 million to its estimated net realizable value based upon a sales agreement. This was charged to cost of sales in the Consumer International segment. The remaining value of the plant of approximately $2.3 million was
reclassified from property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company wrote-down the value of manufacturing assets by approximately $1.2 million and wrote-off approximately $ 1.5 million of manufacturing equipment removed from service. The
write-down was a result of declining sales volume and discounted cash flows were used to determine its value. Both amounts are included in Cost of Sales in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. The charges and the remaining carrying
value are included in the Consumer Domestic segment.

5. Unilever Oral Care
Business Acquisition

On October 20, 2003, the Company
purchased four oral care brands from Unilever in the United States and Canada. The purchase includes the MENTADENT brand of toothpaste and toothbrushes, PEPSODENT and AIM toothpaste, and exclusive licensing rights to CLOSE-UP toothpaste

The Company paid Unilever approximately $104 million in cash at closing
and assumed certain liabilities, and will make additional performance-based payments of between $5 million and $12 million payable over eight years following the transaction which will be accounted for as additional purchase price. Through December
31, 2004, the Company has made contingent payments of $2.5 million. The acquisition was funded by obtaining new term loans through an Amendment to the Company’s Credit Agreement dated September 28, 2001 (which was subsequently refinanced in May
2004 as part of the Armkel acquisition) as well as available cash. Results of operations for the businesses are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from October 20, 2003. Separate pro forma comparative results of
operations are not presented because they are not materially different from the Company’s reported results of operations; however, pro forma results for the period in 2003 that the Company did not own the business are included in the pro forma
income statement (see note 7).

The following table summarizes
the final purchase price allocation:

6. Armkel, LLC

On May 28, 2004, the Company purchased the remaining 50% of Armkel that it
did not previously own from affiliates of Kelso & Company for a purchase price of approximately $262 million.

The Armkel acquisition was funded using available cash and by obtaining new Term A and B Loans through an amendment to the Company’s existing credit
agreement. In connection with the amendment, the Company, among other things, was provided with a new Term A Loan in the amount of $100 million, and a new Term B Loan in the amount of $440 million, which were used to replace the Company’s
existing credit facility of approximately $194 million, to replace Armkel’s principal credit facility of approximately $136 million and to provide $210 million to fund a portion of the purchase price for the transaction. The new Term B Loan has
essentially the same terms as the replaced loans, but with more favorable interest rate provisions. Results of operations for the business are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from May 29, 2004.



The following table summarizes the historical investment and the preliminary purchase price allocation
relating to purchasing Kelso’s 50% interest in Armkel.

The allocation of
purchase price has not yet been finalized since an independent appraisal is still in process. However, management does not believe that the finalization of the purchase price allocation will have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statement.

The following table summarizes financial
information for Armkel for the five months ending May 28, 2004 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, during which the Company accounted for its 50% interest under the equity method.

For the five months
ended May 28, 2004, the Company invoiced Armkel $10.2 million for administrative and management oversight services (which is included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses), purchased $0.8 million of deodorant
anti-perspirant inventory produced by Armkel in the first five months of 2004 and sold Armkel $0.7 million of ARM & HAMMER products to be sold in international markets.

During 2003 and 2002, the Company invoiced Armkel $24.4 million and $22.5 million respectively, for administrative and
manufacturing services, and purchased $1.9 million and $7.1 million of deodorant anti-perspirant inventory produced by Armkel at its cost. The Company sold Armkel $2.9 million and $1.4 million of ARM & HAMMER products to be sold in international
markets in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Armkel invoiced the Company $1.7 million for transition administrative services in 2002. The Company had an open receivable from Armkel of approximately $6.7 million December 31, 2003.

7. Unaudited Pro Forma Results

The following pro forma information gives effect to the Company’s
purchase of Kelso’s interest in Armkel and the Unilever oral care business as if they occurred on January 1, 2003. Pro forma adjustments include inventory step-up charges, equity appreciation rights, additional interest expense and the related
income tax impact, as well as elimination of intercompany sales.

Pro forma comparative net sales, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended December 31,2004 and December 31,2003 are as follows:



8. Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.”

The following table discloses the carrying value
of all intangible assets:

The increase in
tradenames as compared to the values at December 31, 2003 is primarily due to the consolidation of Armkel and the final valuation adjustments associated with the Unilever brands acquired in 2003. Furthermore, in connection with the Armkel
acquisition, the tradenames acquired reflect their estimated fair market value as of May 28, 2004, per an independent appraisal.

Intangible amortization expense amounted to $6.6 million for the twelve months of 2004 and $2.1 million for the same period of 2003. The Company’s
current estimated intangible amortization will be approximately $7.2 million in each of the next five years.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company completed the annual impairment test of the valuation of unamortized tradenames, and based upon the results,
there was no impairment. During 2002, the Company recorded a $2.3 million impairment charge related to one of its unamortized tradenames due to changes in market conditions and included the charge in selling, general and administrative expenses.
This charge affected the Company’s Consumer Domestic segment. Fair value was determined using discounted cash flows. This tradename, which had a carrying value of approximately $4.8 million, was subsequently amortized as it has been determined
to have a finite life.

The changes in the carrying amount of
goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 are as follows:

9. Accounts Payable and Accrued
Expenses

Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of
the following:



10. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt

Short-term borrowings and long-term debt consist of the following:

As of December 31,
2004, the principal payments required to be made with respect to the Company’s consolidated total debt are as follows:

The Company had
outstanding total debt of $858.7 million and cash of $145.5 million (of which $56.5 million resides in foreign subsidiaries). Total debt less cash (“Net debt”) was $713.2 million at December 31, 2004. The Company had outstanding total debt
of $397.0 million, and cash of $75.6 million, resulting in net debt of $321.4 million at December 31, 2003.

During the first quarter of 2003, the Company entered into a receivables purchase agreement with an issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper in order
to refinance a portion, $60.0 million, of its primary credit facility. The transaction resulted in a reclassification of long-term debt to short-term debt in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Under this arrangement, the Company sold,
and will sell from time to time, throughout the three-year term of the agreement, its trade accounts receivable to a wholly-owned, consolidated, special purpose finance subsidiary, Harrison Street Funding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(“Harrison”). Harrison in turn sold, and will sell on an ongoing basis, to the commercial paper issuer an undivided interest in the pool of accounts receivable. The receivables assets and the short-term borrowings of Harrison are included
in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The transactions were entered into to reduce certain expenses associated with the credit facility in addition to lowering the Company’s financing costs by accessing the commercial paper
market. During July 2004, as a result of the Armkel acquisition, the Company amended its accounts receivable securitization agreement to increase the capacity that can be borrowed from $60 million to $100 million. The balance outstanding under the
agreement on December 31, 2004 was $93.7 million. The proceeds of the increased borrowing were used to make a voluntary Term A Loan payment on August 4, 2004.

In August of 2003, the Company issued $100 million principal amount of 5.25% convertible senior debentures due August 15, 2033 through a private
placement to qualified institutional buyers. The debentures rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The debentures are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of
the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing that indebtedness and to all of the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company
has the right to redeem all or part of the debentures on or after August 15, 2008. Interest is paid semi-annually on August 15th and February 15th of each year.

On each of August 15, 2010, August 15, 2013, August 15, 2018, August 15, 2023 and August 15, 2028, or in the event of a change in control, holders may
require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of the debentures at a purchase price equal to 100.0% of the



principal amount of the debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Company must pay cash for any debentures repurchased on
August 15, 2010. However, the Company may choose to pay cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash or shares of its common stock for any debentures repurchased on August 15, 2013, August 15, 2018, August 15, 2023 or August 15, 2028
or following a change in control.

Holders may convert their
debentures into shares of the Company’s common stock prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 32.26 shares of common stock per each $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $31.00 per
share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. A holder may convert the debentures into the Company’s common stock under the following circumstances: during any conversion period prior to August 15, 2032, if the sale price of the
Company’s common stock is more than 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the first day of that conversion period (the “20% conversion price premium”); the trading
price of a debenture falls below a specified threshold; specified credit rating events with respect to the debentures occur; the Company calls the debentures for redemption; or specified corporate transactions occur.

In conjunction with the Armkel acquisition, the Company entered into an
amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and other financial institutions, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Fleet National Bank and National City Bank, each as a documentation agent, Citicorp North America,
Inc., as syndication agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) a five year term loan in a principal amount of $100.0 million (the “Term A Loan”), (ii) a seven year term loan in the
principal amount of $440.0 million, which term loan may be increased by up to an additional $250.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions (the “Term B Loan,” and together with the Term A Loan, the “Term Loans”), and
(iii) a five year multi-currency revolving credit and letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million (the “Revolving Loans”), $94.0 million of which was undrawn at December 31, 2004. The Term Loans were
used to finance the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Armkel not previously owned by the Company, pay amounts outstanding under Armkel’s principal credit facility of approximately $136.0 million and refinance the Company’s
principal credit facility of approximately $194.0 million. The Revolving Loans are available for general corporate purposes. The obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and
certain of its domestic subsidiaries. Those domestic subsidiaries have also guaranteed the loan obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Term Loans and the Revolving Loans bear interest under one of two rate options, selected by the Company,
equal to (a) either (i) a eurocurrency rate (adjusted for any reserve requirements) (“Eurocurrency Rate”) or (ii) the greater of the prime rate, the secondary market rate for three-month certificates of deposit (adjusted for any reserve
requirements) plus the applicable FDIC assessment rate plus 1.0%, or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% (“Alternate Base Rate”), plus (b) an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by the Company’s current
leverage ratio. At the closing date of the Credit Agreement, the applicable margin was (a) 1.75% for the Eurocurrency Rate and (b) 0.75% for the Alternate Base Rate.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company issued $250 million of 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due December 15, 2012
in a private placement. In conjunction with the placement, the Company effected a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the outstanding Armkel 9


/


% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 that it assumed as part of the Armkel acquisition. The price paid for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered and accepted for payment
(including a consent payment of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes) was $1,086.80, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date. Of the outstanding balance of $225 million, $218.6 million was purchased by the Company. As a result, the
Company incurred a fourth quarter loss on early extinguishment of debt charge of $14.9 million (which included the write-off of existing deferred financing costs).

As noted above, on December 22, 2004, the Company issued $250 million of 6.0% senior subordinated notes due December 15,
2012 (“Notes”) with interest paid semi-annually. The Notes were issued at par and the Company received net proceeds of $225 million. That amount was used to redeem $218.6 million of the Armkel notes and the balance was used to make
voluntary bank debt repayments. The notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by substantially all of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries whose annual revenues (other than intercompany revenues) or total assets
(other than intercompany receivables) are $100,000 or more. The notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after December 15, 2008, at pre determined redemption prices, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption. The notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time prior to December 15, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of redemption plus a “make-whole” premium. At any time prior to December 15, 2007, The Company may redeem up to 35% of the original principal amount of the notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance
of additional notes issued under the same indenture) with the proceeds of one or more equity offerings of the Company’s capital stock at a redemption price of 106.0% of the principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of redemption.

The terms of the
subordinated note and credit agreement place a limit on the amount of certain cash payments the Company can make. This limitation includes the amount the Company can pay in dividends on its common stock. As long as the Company is not in default
under either agreement, the limitation ( which is a percent of net income relative to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio) is such that the Company does not currently anticipate having an effect on the its ability to pay dividends at its
current rate.

In addition, QGN has lines of credit which
enable it to borrow up to $7 million in its local currency, of which approximately $3 million was utilized as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 18.0%
and 15.3%, respectively. QGN’s long-term debt is at various interest rates that are determined by several inflation indexes in Brazil.



11. Income Taxes

The components of income before taxes are as follows:

Deferred tax (assets)/liabilities
consist of the following at December 31:



Long term deferred tax assets are presented in other assets in the December 31, 2004 balance sheet.
Current deferred tax liability is presented in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses in the December 31, 2004 balance sheet. The change in the valuation allowance relates to the Company being able to realize the benefit of certain loss
carryforwards.

The difference between tax expense and the tax
that would result from the application of the federal statutory rate is as follows:

At December 31,
2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal, foreign and state of $12.0 million, $26.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively. These net operating losses expire on various dates through December 31, 2020.

The Company has undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of
approximately $39.3 million at December 31, 2004 for which deferred taxes have not been provided. These earnings, which are considered to be invested indefinitely, subject to the Company’s final determination of the impact of the AJCA discussed
below, would be subject to US tax if they were remitted as dividends. At this time it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability on these earnings.

The AJCA was enacted on October 22, 2004. The AJCA repeals an export incentive, creates a new deduction for qualified
domestic manufacturing activities and includes a special one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the U.S. In accordance with FSP FAS 109-1, the Company will treat the deduction for qualified domestic manufacturing
activities, which is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2005, as a reduction of the income tax provision in future years as realized. In connection with FSP FAS 109-2, which allows companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the
AJCA on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings, the Company has not decided on whether, or to what extent, the Company may repatriate foreign earnings under the AJCA. The range of the income tax effect of the repatriation cannot
be reasonably estimated at this time.

The Company records
liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions. The liabilities relate to tax return positions, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities. The Company adjusts these
liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by Courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations. The Company’s tax rate includes the impact of the
liabilities and any changes to the liabilities. Settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash. Favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. The Internal Revenue Service
is currently examining the Company’s 2002 US Federal Corporation Income Tax Return.



12. Benefit Plans

The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain hourly employees. Pension benefits to retired employees are based upon their length of
service and a percentage of qualifying compensation during the final years of employment. The Company’s funding policy is consistent with federal funding requirements.

The Company maintains unfunded plans, which provide medical benefits for eligible domestic retirees and their dependents and
employees in Canada. The Company accounts for these benefits in accordance with SFAS 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” This standard requires the cost of such benefits to be recognized
during the employee’s active working career.

The
following table provides information on the status of the plans at December 31:



The Company’s pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2004 and 2003, by
asset category are as follows:

The Company’s
investment policy is designed to provide flexibility in the asset mix decision based on management’s assessment of economic conditions with the overall objective being maximum rates of return appropriately balanced to minimize market risks.
While our asset mix has varied significantly over the last two years as a result of the Armkel acquisition, our long-term strategic goal is to reach an asset mix comprising approximately 60% equity securities and 40% debt/fixed income securities.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations as of December 31:

Weighted-average
assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31:

The Company had a
settlement loss in the fourth quarter of 2004 to one of the Canadian pension plans due to the Company’s decision to terminate the plan.

Net Pension and Net Postretirement Benefit Costs consisted of the following components:

The Company’s
pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to our actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions.

The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the
expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as the Moody’s AA Corporate Bond Index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively
settled. Based on the published rates as of December 31, 2004, as well as selected Corporate bonds matching our estimated cash flows of the plans, the Company



used a discount rate of 5.75% for the three remaining domestic plans, a decline of 25 basis points from the 6.00% rate used in 2003. This had the effect of
increasing the projected benefit obligation for pensions and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $1.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by
taking into account a historical trend based on a 15 year average, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these
factors, the Company’s weighted average expected long-term rate of return as of December 31, 2004 is 7.61%, a decline of 111 basis points from the 8.72% rate used at December 31, 2003. This decrease is due to the change in expected long-term
rate of the Company’s domestic plans from 8.75% to 8.25% and the inclusion of Armkel’s plans. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in less than a $0.4 million change in pension expense for 2005.

On December 31, 2004 the accumulated benefit obligation
related to our pension plans exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets (such excess is referred to as an un-funded accumulated benefit obligation). This difference is attributed to (1) an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that
resulted from the decrease in the interest rate used to discount the projected benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from 6.00% to 5.75%, partially offset by (2) the increase in the market value of the plan assets at December 31, 2004.
As a result, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, the Company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of $1.4 million included in benefit obligations, and recorded a charge, net of tax, to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $0.8 million
which decreased stockholders’ equity. The charge to stockholders’ equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the income
statement impact for 2004 is estimated to be approximately $0.8 million charged to earnings.

The pension plan assets primarily consist of equity mutual funds, fixed income funds and a guaranteed investment contract fund.

The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $5.4 million in 2005. The contribution is
$0.9 million higher than 2004 due to the inclusion of Armkel’s pension plans.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation has been determined by application of the provisions of the Company’s medical plans including established maximums and sharing of costs, relevant actuarial
assumptions and health-care cost trend rates projected at 12.56% for 2005 and decreasing to an ultimate rate of 5.13% in 2014. The Company has a maximum annual benefit based on years of service for those participants over 65 years of age.

The following chart shows the effect of a 1% change in
healthcare cost trends:

Deferred
Compensation Plan

The Company maintains a deferred
compensation plan in which certain management and highly compensated employees are eligible to defer a maximum of 100% of their regular compensation and bonuses and non-employee Board members are eligible to defer up to 100% of their directors’
compensation. The compensation deferred under this plan is credited with earnings or losses based upon changes in values of investments elected by the plan participant. Each plan participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation and earnings
credited to his or her account. The deferrals are invested by the Company through a trust. The trust invests these deferred amounts based upon the elections made by the participants, with the exception of elections made for Church & Dwight
stock. The liability to plan participants for contribution designation to Company stock is based on the changes in the quoted fair value of the Company’s stock. The invested deferred amounts are invested in either equity mutual funds or money
market accounts. The Company uses hedging instruments to minimize the cost related to the volatility of Church & Dwight stock. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the liability under these plans amounted to $32.4 million and $24.4 million,
respectively and the funded balances amounted to $21.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively. The amounts charged to earnings, including the effect of the hedges, totaled $1.5 million, $2.0 million, and $2.1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Company also maintains a defined

The Company also has an employee 401K savings plan. The Company matches 50%
of each employee’s contribution up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s earnings. The Company’s matching contributions to the savings plan were $2.5 million, $2.0 million and $2.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



13. Stock Option Plans

The Company has options outstanding under three equity compensation plans. Under the 1983 Stock Option Plan and the 1994 Incentive Stock Option Plan,
the Company may grant options to key management employees. Under the Stock Option Plan for Directors the Company grants options to non-employee directors. Options outstanding under the plans are issued at market value, vest on the third anniversary
of the date of grant and must be exercised within ten years of the date of grant. A total of 10.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock is authorized for issuance for the exercise of stock options.

Stock option transactions for the three years ended December 31, 2004 were as

At December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, 2,720,108 options, 3,865,113 options and 4,177,395 options were exercisable, respectively.

The table below summarizes information relating to options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2004.

The fair value of
options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is $10.9 million, $6.8 million, and $8.9 million, respectively and the weighted average fair value per share of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is $11.99, $7.97 and $8.79, respectively.

The fair value of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is estimated on the
date the options are granted based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

15. Common Stock Voting Rights and Rights Agreement

At the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 8, 2003,
shareholders voted to amend the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate time phased voting rights. Prior to such amendment, each share of Company common stock beneficially owned by the same person for a period of at least
48 consecutive months was entitled to four votes per share, while all other shares were entitled to one vote. As a result of this amendment, each share of Company common stock is entitled to one vote.

On August 27, 1999, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan
(the Plan) that essentially reinstates a Shareholder Rights Plan originally enacted in 1989, which had terminated. In connection with the adoption of the Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock. Each right, which is not presently exercisable, entitles the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $200.00. In the event that any person,
acquires 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, each holder of a right (other than the acquiring person or group) will be entitled to receive, upon payment of the exercise price, that number of shares of Common Stock into which the
Junior Participating Preferred Stock is convertible having a market value equal to two times the exercise price. In order to retain flexibility and the ability to maximize shareholder value in the event of unknown future transactions, the Board of
Directors retains the power to redeem the rights for a set amount.

The rights were issued on September 13, 1999, payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on that date. The rights will expire on September 13, 2009.

On August 6, 2004, the Company announced a 3 for 2 stock split. The shares from the stock split were distributed on
September 1, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 16, 2004. All share and per share information in this report reflects the impact of the stock split.

16. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

a. Rent expense amounted to $11.9 million in 2004, $8.5 million in 2003 and $8.9 million in 2002. The
Company is obligated for minimum annual rentals under non-cancelable long-term operating leases as follows:



The Company accounts for step rent provisions and escalation clauses under its operating
leases on a straight-line basis in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 15 of SFAS 13. Any capital improvement funding or other lease concessions are taken into account when computing lease payments on a straight-line basis. None of the
Company’s lease payments is computed based on an index or other rate.

b. In December 1981, the Company formed a partnership with a supplier of raw materials which mines and processes sodium mineral deposits owned by each of the two partners in Wyoming. The Company purchases the majority
of its sodium raw material requirements from the partnership. This agreement terminates upon two years’ written notice by either company. The Company has an annual commitment to purchase 240,000 tons, based upon market price. There are no other
material transactions with the partnership or the Company’s partner.

c. On January 17, 2002, a petition for appraisal, Cede & Co., Inc. and GAMCO Investors, Inc. v. Medpointe Healthcare Inc., Civil Action No. 19354, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
demanding a determination of the fair value of shares of Medpointe. The action was brought by purported former shareholders of Carter-Wallace in connection with the merger on September 28, 2001 of MCC Acquisition Sub Corporation with and into
Carter-Wallace. The merged entity subsequently changed its name to Medpointe. The petitioners sought an appraisal of the fair value of their shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The matter was heard by the
court on March 10 and 11, 2003, at which time the petitioners purportedly held approximately 2.3 million shares of Medpointe. An additional post-trial hearing was held on January 20, 2004 to address the valuation of the Company. On July 30, 2004 the
Court issued a letter informing the parties that it had determined that the fair value of a share of Carter-Wallace on the Merger Date to be $24.45, and that interest at the annual rate of 7.5% compounded quarterly should be added to the award.

Medpointe and certain former Carter-Wallace
shareholders were party to an indemnification agreement pursuant to which such shareholders would be required to indemnify Medpointe from a portion of the damages suffered by Medpointe in relation to the exercise of appraisal rights by the former
Carter-Wallace shareholders in the merger. Pursuant to the agreement, the shareholders agreed to indemnify Medpointe for 40% of any Appraisal Damages (defined as the recovery greater than the per share merger price times the number of shares in the
appraisal class) suffered by Medpointe in relation to the merger; provided that if the total amount of Appraisal Damages exceeds $33.3 million, then the indemnifying stockholders will indemnify Medpointe for 100% of any damages suffered in excess of
that amount. The Company, in turn, was party to an agreement with Medpointe pursuant to which it agreed to indemnify Medpointe and certain related parties against 60% of any Appraisal Damages for which Medpointe remains liable. The maximum liability
to the Company pursuant to the indemnification agreement was $12 million.

On March 27, 2003, GAMCO Investors, Inc. filed another complaint in the New York Supreme Court seeking damages from MedPointe, the former directors of Carter-Wallace, and one of the former shareholders of
Carter-Wallace. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with certain employment agreements with former Carter-Wallace executives, the sale of Carter Wallace’s consumer products business to the Company and the merger of
MCC Acquisition Sub Corporation with and into Carter-Wallace. The complaint sought monetary damages and equitable relief, including among other things, invalidation of the transactions. On May 21, 2004, the court dismissed certain of the
plaintiffs’ claims. The Company was not named as a defendant in this action and believed it had no liability.

On October 12, 2004, Medpointe and the plaintiffs settled both of the legal actions described above. In connection with the settlement of
the legal actions, the Company entered into a settlement agreement and release with Medpointe pursuant to which, in settlement of the Company’s indemnification obligations or other claims that Medpointe may have against the Company and certain
persons related to the Company, the Company agreed to pay Medpointe $8.1 million, of which $4.9 million is included in interest expense in the third quarter of 2004 and $3.2 million was applied towards goodwill. Payment was made by the Company
during the fourth quarter of 2004.

d. The
Company’s distribution of condoms under the Trojan and other trademarks is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Certain of the Company’s condoms and similar condoms sold by its competitors contain the spermicide
nonoxynol-9 (N-9). The World Health Organization and other interested groups have issued reports suggesting that N-9 should not be used rectally or for multiple daily acts of vaginal intercourse, given the ingredient’s potential to cause
irritation to human membranes. The Company expects the FDA to issue non-binding draft guidance concerning the labeling of condoms with N-9, although the timing of such draft guidance remains uncertain. The Company believes that condoms with N-9
provide an acceptable added means of contraceptive protection and is cooperating with the FDA concerning the appropriate labeling revisions, if any. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the FDA review. While awaiting further FDA
guidance, the Company has implemented interim labeling revisions that caution against rectal use and more-than-once-a-day vaginal use of N-9-containing condoms, and has launched a public information campaign to communicate these messages to the
affected communities. If the FDA or state governments promulgate rules which prohibit or restrict the use of N-9 in condoms (such as new labeling requirements), the financial condition and operating results of the Company could suffer.

e. On January 30, 2004 a suit was filed against the
Company by Fleming Companies, Inc. in the US Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware. Fleming, a customer of the Company, previously filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on April 1,
2003. Fleming sought the recovery of certain preference payments and overpayments made to the Company in the amount of approximately $4.2 million. In addition, Fleming claimed that it is owed approximately $1.9 million relating to a vendor agreement
with the Company.



In December 2004, the Company settled this matter with the Reclamation Creditors’
Trust, successor in interest to the debtors, including Fleming, in the amount of $1.1 million. This amount was paid in January 2005.

f. The Company has commitments to acquire approximately $75 million of raw material and packaging supplies from its vendors. The packaging
supplies are in either a converted or non-converted status. This enables the Company to respond quickly to changes in customer orders/requirements.

g. The Company has outstanding letters of credit of approximately $6.1 million with several banks which guarantee payment for such things
as insurance claims in the event of the Company’s insolvency, a year’s worth of lease payments on a warehouse, and 200 days of interest on an Industrial Revenue Bond borrowing.

h. In connection with the acquisition of the oral care brands from Unilever, the Company will make
additional performance-based payments of a minimum of $5 million and a maximum of $12 million over the eight year period following the date of acquisition. All payments will be accounted for as additional purchase price. Through December 31, 2004,
the Company has paid approximately $2.5 million.

i. The Company, in the ordinary course of its business, is the subject of, or a party to, various pending or threatened legal actions. The Company believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial position.

17. Segments

Segment Information
