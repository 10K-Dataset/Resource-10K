GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

PART I

General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “ourselves,” the “Company,” “General Motors,” or “GM") was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009 and on July 10, 2009 acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of General Motors Corporation through a Section 363 sale under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (363 Sale). General Motors Corporation is sometimes referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (2013 Form 10-K), for the periods on or before July 9, 2009, as “Old GM," as it is the predecessor entity solely for accounting and financial reporting purposes. On July 10, 2009 in connection with the 363 Sale, General Motors Corporation changed its name to Motors Liquidation Company, which is sometimes referred to in this 2013 Form 10-K for the periods after July 10, 2009 as “MLC.” On December 15, 2011 MLC was dissolved and the Motors Liquidation Company GUC Trust (GUC Trust) assumed responsibility for the affairs of and certain claims against MLC and its debtor subsidiaries that were not concluded prior to MLC's dissolution. MLC transferred to the GUC Trust all of MLC's remaining undistributed shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire our common stock.

In addition to the products we sell to our dealers for consumer retail sales, we also sell cars and trucks to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. We sell vehicles to fleet customers directly or through our network of dealers. Our retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.

Competitive Position

Information in this


Form 10-K relating to our relative position in the global automotive industry is based upon the good faith estimates of management and includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Market share information in this


Form 10-K is based on retail vehicle sales volume. Retail vehicle sales data, which represents estimated sales to the end customer, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period. However, retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Worldwide market share and vehicle sales data excludes the markets of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.

Retail sales volume includes vehicles produced by certain joint ventures. The joint venture agreements with SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW) and FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM) allow for significant rights as a member as well as the contractual right to report SGMW and FAW-GM joint venture sales in China.

The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include price, quality, available options, style, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.

Wholesale and Retail Vehicle Sales



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, is the measure that correlates vehicle sales to our revenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of automotive Net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles produced by nonconsolidated joint ventures.

The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

In the year ended

December 31, 2013

71.3% of our retail vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total industry retail sales volume, or estimated sales volume where retail sales volume is not available, of new vehicles of domestic and foreign makes and the related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

__________

(a)

North America vehicle sales primarily represent sales to the end customer. Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and South America vehicle sales primarily represent estimated sales to the end customer. In countries where end customer data is not readily available other data sources, such as wholesale or forecast volumes, are used to estimate vehicle sales.

(

b)

Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies; however, revenue is not recognized at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations.

(c)

Vehicle sales data may include rounding differences.

(d)

Includes the vehicle sales for joint ventures in the table below. Joint venture vehicle sales for General Motors India Private Limited and Chevrolet Sales India Private Limited (collectively GM India) are included in the table below through August 31, 2012. Refer to Notes


and


to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our joint ventures and the acquisition of GM India.

(e)

Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended

December 31, 2013

reflect continued recovery in the U.S. despite an intense competitive environment. Growth was largely attributed to new portfolio entries. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended

December 31, 2012

reflect an intensified competitive environment in the U.S., including aggressive competitor pricing and media spending, as well as key competitor new product launches. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended

December 31, 2011

reflect the moderate improvement in certain facets of the U.S. economy which contributed to a slow but steady improvement in U.S. industry vehicle sales, as well as increased volumes in Russia and China.

Fleet Sales and Deliveries

The sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales. Certain fleet transactions, particularly daily rental, are generally less profitable than retail sales. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales. Fleet sales data may include rounding differences (vehicles in thousands):

The following table summarizes U.S. fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total U.S. vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Product Pricing

Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. In 2014 we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices.

Cyclical Nature of Business

Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending.

Relationship with Dealers

We market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.

The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial, Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally Financial) and other financial institutions.

The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property

Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering, and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers. In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 research and development expenses were

$7.2 billion

,

$7.4 billion

and

$8.1 billion

.

Our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption.

Fuel Efficiency

We are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions; and (3) vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures.

Alternative Fuel Vehicles

Alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. Leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on gasoline-ethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

We currently offer 16 FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2014 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We continue to study the future role FlexFuel vehicles may play in the U.S. in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure. In


94% of vehicle sales in Brazil were FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on 100% ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in Australia, Thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace.

We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are clean-burning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources, and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels.

We produce CNG bi-fuel capable vehicles in Europe such as the Opel Zafira, and in the U.S., the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana fullsize vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers, that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and CNG. We also produce the CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500 HD pick-up trucks that are available to both commercial and retail customers. In addition we recently announced the offering of a CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Impala full-size sedan to both fleet and retail markets starting in the summer of 2014. We offer LPG capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure, regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold.

Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles

We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, extended range and battery electric vehicles. We currently offer 7 models in the U.S. featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt, Opel Ampera and Cadillac ELR. In 2013 we introduced the Chevrolet Spark EV and plan to invest heavily to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and in-house development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries, electric motors and power control systems.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology

As part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated nearly 3 million miles of real-world driving by consumers, celebrities, business partners and government agencies. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

GM and Honda entered into a long-term agreement to co-develop a next-generation fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies, aiming for the 2020 timeframe. The collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise, economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon GM's and Honda’s strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology.

OnStar

OnStar, LLC (OnStar) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 6.5 million subscribers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and, through a joint venture, China. OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2014 model year vehicles. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics and hands-free calling.

OnStar has developed a system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. OnStar also launched a mobile application to provide subscribers with up-to-date vehicle information such as oil level, tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start, remote door unlock and navigation services from a mobile phone.

Product Development

Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development. We define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.

A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle such as steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.

Intellectual Property

We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.

Raw Materials, Services and Supplies

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily composed of steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements.

In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10% to 11% of our total purchases from 2011 to 2013.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Automotive Emissions Control

We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world.

North America

The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments. Canada’s federal government is aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. These requirements include vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and OBD system requirements. Each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements. Fleet-wide emissions compliance must also be achieved based on a sales-weighted fleet average.

While we believe all our products are currently in compliance with EPA and CARB regulatory requirements, both agencies have ongoing “in-use” evaluations of compliance for products from all manufacturers. It is possible that we or either agency could identify potential non-compliance, which could lead to some type of field action to remedy the issue. Testing is conducted at various times. This includes pre-production testing of vehicles as part of certification and in-use testing of customer vehicles at specified mileages.

CARB has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year. These requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards. The EPA has proposed similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year. These new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance.

California law requires that 12% of 2014 model year cars and certain light-duty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles (ZEV) such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year. Manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial ZEV credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties. Additional portions of the ZEV requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial ZEV requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria. We are complying with the ZEV requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the ZEV and partial ZEV requirements. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. A portion of this requirement may be met with PHEVs that meet specified criteria including an extended emission system warranty.

The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Thirteen states as well as the Province of Quebec currently have these standards in effect, and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the ZEV requirements. Additional states could also adopt the California standards in the future.

Vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements. We also certify heavy-duty engines for installation in other manufacturers' products. We are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by EPA and CARB regulations. We are meeting OBD requirements for heavy-duty vehicles with certain hardware and software changes.

In Mexico we must obtain model year certification from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency for each engine family and vehicle line before we can sell vehicles. Stringent light-duty vehicle emission requirements applicable to vehicles sold in Mexico are enforced starting 18 months after nationwide availability of Ultra Low Sulfur Fuels.  Emission requirements applicable to medium- and heavy-duty trucks powered by gasoline, CNG or LPG were upgraded in 2012.  Stringent emission requirements applicable to medium- and heavy-duty trucks powered by diesel have been proposed but no enforcement date has been established yet.

Regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases are discussed under “Automotive Fuel Economy” since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of a fuel economy requirement.

Europe



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The EC imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 European Union (EU) Member States and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UNECE. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU Member States. Type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. EU and UNECE requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation.

A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 5, was effective in 2011. Future European emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. The Euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2017. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with Euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards. These technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European market for small- and mid-size diesel vehicles. Gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements. The measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.

In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, the EC will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, real driving emission, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD.

International Operations

China has implemented Euro 4 standards with European OBD requirements nationwide for newly registered vehicles. Beijing currently requires many elements of Euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles. Beijing, Shanghai and the Pearl River delta area are expected to require additional elements of Euro 5 standards in 2014. Nationwide implementation of Euro 5 is expected between 2015 and 2017. Beijing is considering the implementation of Euro 6 or EPA standards as early as 2016 and Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery as early as 2017. For diesel-powered vehicles China has implemented Euro 4 standards for new type approvals of both light-duty diesel vehicles and all new registrations of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Enforcement of Euro 4 standards for new diesel light-duty registrations began in 2013.

South Korea has implemented the Euro 5 emission standards with European OBD requirements for diesel-powered vehicles and the CARB standards for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles. Commencing in 2014 new type-approvals will require the vehicle to meet Euro 6 diesel standards. The government is also considering the introduction of amendments to the low-emission vehicle program, LEVIII of the CARB standards, for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles with the planned implementation in 2016.

India has implemented Euro 4 equivalent emission norms in 13 major cities of the country, where sulfur gasoline and diesel fuels (BS IV Fuel) are required and have been made available. Euro 4 norms are expected to apply in additional cities as BS IV fuels are made available in 2014 and 2015 in a phased manner.

South America

Certain countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and others follow the EU test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national L5 low emission vehicle standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009. L6 standards for light diesel vehicles were implemented in 2012 and mandate OBD installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models. Argentina implemented Euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and the implementation of Euro 5 standards has been delayed from 2014 to 2015 for new vehicles and from 2016 to 2017 for all vehicles. Chile has enforced Euro 5 or U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 emission standards for diesel vehicles and will implement Euro 5 or U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 standards for gasoline vehicles in September 2014.

Industrial Environmental Control

Environmental Matters



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. Refer to

Note 17

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on environmental matters including site remediation.

Facility Management

To mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. At December 31, 2013 85 (or over 50%) of our manufacturing facilities were landfill-free facilities. Additionally we have 25 non-manufacturing facilities that are landfill free. At our landfill-free manufacturing facilities approximately 96% of waste materials are recycled or reused and 4% is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. Including construction, demolition and remediation wastes, we estimate that we recycled, reused, or composted over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations and estimate that we converted approximately 75,000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities in the year ended December 31, 2013.

In 2013 we surpassed our internal 2020 Manufacturing Commitment initiative to reduce total waste on a kg/vehicle basis by 10%, having reduced total waste by more than 45 kg/vehicle (including metals and foundry-related wastes). Total waste includes all byproducts from routine manufacturing operations, excluding construction, demolition and remediation wastes and materials that are sent for direct reuse (without processing).

In addition to providing environmental benefits our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our energy costs, and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal.

We continue to make progress on our other 2020 Manufacturing commitments including the implementation of our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency. Our data collection and management system is designed to monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related CO


emissions including collecting and verifying energy, water and other environmental data from our facilities. Our approach to addressing climate change includes setting a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, collecting accurate data, and by publicly reporting progress against our target.

Automotive Fuel Economy

North America

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Beginning with the 2011 model year both car and light-duty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. In 2014 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 33.8 mpg, our import car standard is estimated at 37.2 mpg, and our light-duty truck standard is estimated to be 24.5 mpg. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program.

In August 2012 the EPA and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) finalized a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year light-duty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. This regulation represents a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year light-duty vehicles. This program includes EPA and NHTSA standards that will require an industry-wide standard by 2016. Our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016.

The CARB regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (which is the same as regulating fuel economy). This California program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2016 model years.

A Canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with U.S. standards beginning with the 2011 model year. However these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles. The Province of Quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the California program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Mexico has adopted fuel economy targets similar to the U.S. for 2012-2016 model years. The Mexico standards offer additional flexibilities when compared to the U.S. requirements to account for the differences in terrain type, vehicle mix and fuel quality.  Discussions for post 2016 standards are expected to begin in 2014 calendar year.

Europe

Legislation regulating fleet average CO


emissions was implemented for passenger cars in 2012. Based on a target function of CO


to vehicle weight, each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales-weighted fleet average target. The fleet average requirement began phasing in during 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. Automobile manufacturers can earn super-credits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific CO


value. This is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultra-low CO


vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the CO


fleet average. Automobile manufacturers may gain credit for eco-innovations for those technologies which improve real-world fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle, such as solar panels on vehicles. There is also a 5% credit for FlexFuel vehicles if more than 30% of refueling stations in an EU Member State sell E85. Further regulatory detail is being developed. The legislation sets a target for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement. We are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational CO


targets for each market entry in Europe.

In 2011 the EU adopted a standard to regulate CO


emissions from light commercial vehicles. This regulation is modeled after the CO


regulation for passenger cars. It proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO


target with a phase-in of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016. The manufacturer-specific CO


compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel (vehicle curb weight). Flexibilities such as eco-innovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well. An EU long-term target for 2020 has been adopted for light commercial vehicles. We have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational CO


targets for each market entry in Europe.

In July 2012 the EU Commission released a regulatory proposal outlining the regulatory implementation for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles targets effective in 2020. Implementation of the target has been delayed with final release expected in early 2014. While the passenger car target is expected to remain in place beginning in 2020, in that first year (2020) only 95% of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) fleet is required to comply. Full 100% compliance will be required in 2021. The individual manufacturer targets will continue to be determined based on the average vehicle mass. Other compliance flexibilities will be limited adding additional challenges to compliance with the CO


fleet target.

Effective in November 2012 an EC regulation required low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators, which we adopted in 2011. An additional EC regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket.

Seventeen EU Member States have introduced fuel consumption or CO


based vehicle taxation schemes. Tax measures are within the jurisdiction of the EU Member States. We are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws and differences in the tax schemes and thresholds.

International Operations

We face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards in many countries. China has established new Phase 3 fuel economy standards supplementing the current Phase 2 pass-fail system with a corporate fleet average scheme based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 model years. Implementation began in 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. China has continued its retail subsidies for consumers for fuel efficient vehicles, extended range and plug-in, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China is now working on a more aggressive Phase 4 fuel economy standard that is expected to apply to the 2016 through 2020 model years.

In Korea fuel economy/CO


targets for 2012 through 2015 were implemented as part of the government's low carbon/green growth strategy. These targets are based on each vehicle's curb weight and in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economy targets in the U.S. but less stringent than CO


targets in the EU. The targets began being phased in during 2012 with full compliance by 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify based on either fuel consumption or CO


emissions. Each manufacturer has been given a corporate target to meet based on its overall industry fleet fuel economy/CO


average. GM Korea Company's (GM Korea) current product portfolio is expected to comply with the targets by 2015. However, in 2014 the Korean



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

government plans to set more stringent fuel economy targets for 2016 and beyond that will likely reach the level in Japan by 2020 and the level in the EU by 2025.

In Saudi Arabia the government is developing a footprint-based fuel economy standard modeled on the U.S. system, which would likely commence in 2016 using the U.S. target value curves from 2011 or 2012. The Saudi program is not expected to include the alternative fuel/advanced technology vehicle and other credits from the U.S. program.

In India the government is developing a weight-based CO


/fuel efficiency regulation that is likely to be implemented in 2017. It is expected that the regulatory standards could be similar but less stringent than levels required in the EU with tighter standards planned for 2022.

In Australia the current government's agenda no longer includes the adoption of attribute-based CO


standards.

South America

In Brazil the government has set new fuel economy requirements called INOVAR AUTO. OEMs have mandatory fleet average compliance required by October 2017 with a reduction from 2012 levels. The Brazilian government provides indirect tax incentives to eligible participant companies that meet certain requirements including these energy efficiency targets. The level of potential indirect tax incentives varies based on the degree and timing to which the targets are met. Participating companies that fail to meet the required criteria are subject to clawback provisions and specific fines.

In Chile every new passenger vehicle up to a certain vehicle weight is required to be tested under Euro procedure in order to determine its reference values to be included in the new mandatory fuel economy label. As a result of this process the label indicates the fuel consumption values for city, highway and combined city-highway and the CO


emission values.

Chemical Regulations

We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.

North America

Governmental agencies in both the U.S. and Canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives, green chemistry, life cycle assessment and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle life-cycle, including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity.

In California two chemical initiatives will become effective in 2014: the brake pad reformulation law and the safer consumer products regulations. The brake pad reformulation law requires brake and vehicle manufacturers to ensure brakes produced after January 2014 meet limits for the amounts of certain heavy metals and are properly certified and labeled. Under the safer consumer products regulation, California EPA will begin regulating specific consumer products that contain chemicals of concern. It is not yet known when vehicle components will be targeted.

Europe

In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements, EU REACH regulation, to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances. This regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. During the pre-registration phase, Old GM and its suppliers registered those substances identified by this regulation. It is to be phased-in over a 10-year period. Under this regulation, “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts, or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements.

Safety



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

In the U.S. if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S.

Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures. Other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Many countries require type approval while the U.S. and Canada require self-certification.

Vehicular Noise Control

In the U.S. passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level. Federal truck regulations preempt all U.S. state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lbs.

Outside the U.S. noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level (e.g., EC or UNECE). We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold. The EC has proposed new noise regulations that would mandate a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions. These proposals are coupled with a new test procedure to better estimate the actual in-use noise emission of vehicles. The proposals of the EC also form the basis for amendment to UNECE vehicle regulations, with the expected effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of North America. At this point, the final noise emission levels as well as the implementation timing of the final regulations are uncertain.

While current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels, formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels. These proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles, specifically hybrids and electrics, may not be readily heard by pedestrians. In the U.S., NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on January 14, 2013 and the U.S. Department of Transportation indicated a final rule is expected to be published in 2015. The UNECE is developing a Global Technical Regulation, sponsored by the U.S., Japan, and the EU, for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels.

We are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals.

Potential Effect of Regulations

We are actively working on aggressive near-term and long-term plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions, mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities, improve fuel efficiency, monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers. This is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles, our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles, our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of FlexFuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. The conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfill-free status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability. We believe that the development and global implementation of new, cost-effective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities.

Despite these advanced technology efforts, our ability to satisfy fuel economy, CO


and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic, consumer, legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. If we are not able to comply with specific new requirements, which include higher CAFE standards and state CO


requirements such as those which require the CARB to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. Environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. Violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, possible fines or a combination of any of those items. We must also cover the cost of repairs conducted under emission defect and performance warranties which apply for specified periods of time and mileage. In turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Pension Legislation

We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal rules and regulations including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans. In July 2012 the U.S. government enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for U.S. pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates. Under current economic conditions we expect the new law to further delay required contributions to our U.S. pension plans. The new law does not impact our reported funded status.

Export Control

We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls. Our Office of Export Compliance and our global Export Compliance Officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

GM Financial is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992. GM Financial conducts its business in North America and, as a result of the 2013 acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations, in Europe and Latin America. GM Financial expects to complete in 2014 the acquisition of Ally Financial's equity interest in GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Company Limited (GMAC-SAIC) that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in China.

GM Financial automobile finance programs in North America include sub-prime lending and full spectrum leasing. The sub-prime lending programs predominantly offer financing to consumers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions. The typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700. Since GM Financial provides financing in a relatively high-risk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing. The full spectrum leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and targets prime and sub-prime consumers leasing new vehicles. GM Financial seeks to provide competitive alternatives to existing marketplace lease offerings in our franchised dealers. GM Financial services its loan and lease portfolio at regional centers using automated servicing and collection systems.

In April 2012 and March 2013, GM Financial launched the U.S. and Canadian commercial lending platforms to further support our franchised dealerships and their affiliates. These platforms are centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites, facilities, facility improvements and working capital. These loans are made on a secured basis.

GM Financial’s international consumer lending programs focus on financing prime quality consumers purchasing our new and used vehicles. In many countries GM Financial also offers financial leases, a lease/retail hybrid product that includes a balloon payment at expiration, and finance-related insurance products through third parties, such as credit life, gap and extended warranty coverage. Commercial products offered to dealer customers include new and used vehicle inventory financing, inventory insurance, working capital and capital improvement loans. Other commercial products include fleet financing and storage center financing.

GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured bank lines, through public and private securitization transactions where such markets are developed and, to a lesser extent in Latin America, through public financing programs including the issuance of commercial paper and other financing programs.

GM Financial retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization, whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts, as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by GM Financial over the life of the securitization. Excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset-backed securities net of credit losses and expenses.

Excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts. Once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to GM Financial. In addition to excess cash flows GM Financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. While we describe each risk separately, some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below.

Our business is highly dependent on sales volume. There is no assurance that the global automobile market will not suffer a significant downturn.

Our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, levels of unemployment, the availability of credit, fluctuations in the cost of fuel and consumer confidence. We cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty and any change in economic and market conditions that negatively affects sales volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers.

Our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term depends on our ability to entice consumers to consider our products when purchasing a new vehicle. The automotive industry, particularly in the U.S., is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations, and in the past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead. Producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and changing any negative perception, in light of Old GM's bankruptcy, will be critical to our long-term profitability. We will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2014. A successful launch of our new vehicles is critical to our short term profitability.

The pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment. In some cases the technologies that we plan to employ, such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology, are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers. There can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. If we are unable to achieve these goals, we may not be able to maintain profitability over the long-term.

Shortages of and volatility in the price of oil have caused and may have a material adverse effect on our business due to shifts in consumer vehicle demand.

Volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, which provide lower profit margins. Any increases in the price of oil in the U.S. or in our other markets or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of political instability in the Middle East, South America and African nations, could weaken the demand for our higher margin fullsize pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles, which could reduce our market share in affected markets, decrease profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depends on our ability to control our costs, which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations.

We are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations, including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives. Our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations. While some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control, others such as interest rates or return on investments, which influence our expense for pensions, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs. Reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance, safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase.

Our automotive manufacturing operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to provide us with systems, components and parts and any disruption in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule and adversely affect our operations.

Our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our use of “just-in-time” manufacturing processes results in our having minimal inventories of the systems, components and parts we need to conduct our automotive manufacturing operations. As a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of systems, components and parts at such times as allow us to meet our production schedules. In some instances we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Where we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely and thus could adversely affect our financial results.

Increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could materially harm our business.

We use various raw materials in our business including steel, non-ferrous metals such as aluminum and copper, and precious metals such as platinum and palladium. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. In recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. Some of these raw materials, such as corrosion-resistant steel, are only available from a limited number of suppliers. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers. An increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes, could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent.

We operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.

The global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand. Many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. Our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements, providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering option package discounts or other marketing incentives, or reducing vehicle prices in certain markets. Manufacturers in lower cost countries such as China and India have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entry-level automobiles. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results, and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle.

Our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances.

Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing, machinery, research and development, product design, engineering, technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements. Large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates. If our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances, they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale. We believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances, which could adversely affect



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

our competitiveness with respect to those competitors. Competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness or liquidity position, which could also materially adversely affect our business.

Our business plan contemplates that we restructure our operations in various European countries, but we may not succeed in doing so, and our failure to restructure these operations in a cost-effective and non-disruptive manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

In 2013 the European automotive industry continued to be severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity.

In response we are executing various actions to strengthen our European operations and increase our competitiveness. The key areas of the plan include:

•

investments in our product portfolio;

•

a revised brand strategy;

•

significant management changes;

•

reducing material, development and production costs; and

•

leveraging synergies from the alliance between us and Peugeot S.A. (PSA).

Notwithstanding the above we believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the European automotive industry will not improve significantly in the short-term and we expect to continue to incur losses in the region as a result. In addition the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated, as well as external factors, which are outside of our control. Our inability to successfully restructure our European operations and implement our plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates and investments that do not achieve adequate returns.

Our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in

Note 15

to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.

There are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market capacity to absorb a particular investment strategy or high volume transactions and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.

Our future funding requirement for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans qualified with the Internal Revenue Service depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, as other factors are held constant. Our potential funding requirements are described in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations -- Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities.”

Factors which affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the U.S., we could be required to contribute more funds, which would negatively affect our cash flow.

We rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing, prime and sub-prime financing to consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles.

In North America GM Financial supports additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring sub-prime vehicle financing as well as providing commercial lending to our dealers. In Europe and South America we rely on GM Financial to support additional consumer leasing of our vehicles and additional sales of our vehicles to



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

prime consumers as well as providing commercial lending to our dealers

.

GM Financial is subject to various risks that could negatively affect its business, operations and access to capital and therefore its ability to provide leasing, prime and sub-prime financing options at competitive rates to consumers of our vehicles and commercial lending to our dealers. Because we rely on GM Financial to serve as an additional source of leasing, prime and sub-prime financing options for consumers and commercial lending to our dealers, any impairment of GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to expand our market penetration among consumers who rely on these financial services to acquire new vehicles and dealers who seek financing. The factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and impair its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include:

•

The ability to close the acquisition of GMAC-SAIC and integrate the acquired Ally Financial international operations  into its business successfully;

•

The availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its consumer and dealer finance activities pending securitization;

•

Its ability to transfer finance receivables and leases to securitization trusts and sell securities in the asset-backed securities market to generate cash proceeds to repay its credit facilities and fund additional finance receivables and leases;

•

The performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by delinquencies, defaults or prepayments;

•

Wholesale auction values of used vehicles;

•

Higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases; and

•

Fluctuations in interest rates and currencies.

The above factors, alone or in combination, could negatively affect GM Financial's business and operations or its ability to provide leasing, prime and sub-prime financing options to consumers to support additional sales of our vehicles and dealer financing.

Our planned investment in new technology in the future is significant and may not be funded at anticipated levels and, even if funded at anticipated levels, may not result in successful vehicle applications.

We intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology. In addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies between 2014 and 2015, largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles. Moreover if our future operations do not provide us with the cash flow we anticipate, we may be forced to reduce, delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology.

In some cases the technologies that we plan to employ, such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology, are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by suppliers. There can be no assurance that these advances will occur in a timely or feasible way, that the funds that we have budgeted for these purposes will be adequate or that we will be able to establish our right to these technologies. However our competitors and others are pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies and there can be no assurance that they will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage.

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information.

We rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management, manufacturing, invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of GM Financial. Additionally we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

networks and systems, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks.

New laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding increased fuel economy requirements and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, or changes in existing ones, may have a significant effect on how we do business.

We are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. We anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product lineup, will increase significantly in the future. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, governmental regulation is driven primarily by concerns about the environment (including greenhouse gas emissions), vehicle safety, fuel economy and energy security. These government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs, including civil penalties. They may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue.

In the U.S. vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions are regulated under a harmonized national program administered by the NHTSA and the EPA. The agencies have set coordinated fuel economy and greenhouse emission standards through the 2025 model year for light duty vehicles and through the 2018 model year for heavy duty trucks. California, which has set its own greenhouse gas emission standards through its AB 1493 Rules, has agreed to accept compliance with the national program as compliance with its state program.

We are committed to meeting or exceeding these U.S. regulatory requirements, and our product plan of record projects compliance with the anticipated national program through the 2021 model year. The standards for the 2022 through 2025 model years may be adjusted as a result of a mid-term review by the agencies. Therefore we believe it is premature to project compliance with possible standards for those years. We expect that to comply with these standards we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles, as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis, or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.

The EU passed legislation, effective in April 2009, that began regulating vehicle CO


emissions in 2012. The legislation sets a target of a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer for 2020, with the requirements for each manufacturer based on the weight of the vehicles it sells. Additional measures have been proposed or adopted in Europe to regulate features such as tire rolling resistance, vehicle air conditioners, tire pressure monitors, gear shift indicators and others. At the national level 17 EU Member States have adopted some form of fuel consumption or carbon dioxide-based vehicle taxation system, which could result in specific market requirements for us to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the EU emissions standards.

Other governments around the world, such as Canada, China, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea are also creating or have new policies to address these same issues. As in the U.S. these government policies could significantly affect our plans for product development. Due to these regulations we could be subject to sizable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. The regulations will result in substantial costs, which could be difficult to pass through to our customers, and could result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which could affect our operations, including facility closings, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.

A significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit.

Many of our operations, particularly in emerging markets, are carried out by joint ventures such as SGM. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. The benefits



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.

Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions.

Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the size of the Chinese market continues to increase, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. In addition our business in China is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in China. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease or do not continue to increase, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.

We could be materially adversely affected by changes or imbalances in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.

Given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business, we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which can have material adverse effects on our business. In preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the U.S. into U.S. Dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date. As a result foreign currency fluctuations and the associated translations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our businesses outside the U.S. expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business.

The majority of our vehicles are sold outside the U.S. We are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the U.S. Operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political, economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including:

•

Economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as China;

•

Economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade and investment policies, including imposing restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between the U.S. and China;

•

Foreign regulations restricting our ability to sell our products in those countries;

•

Differing local product preferences and product requirements, including fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety;

•

Liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws;

•

Differing labor regulations and union relationships;

•

Consequences from changes in tax laws;

•

Difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and

•

Political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and terrorism.

The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business.

New laws, regulations or policies of governmental organizations regarding safety standards, or changes in existing ones, may have a significant negative effect on how we do business.

Our products must satisfy legal safety requirements. Meeting or exceeding government-mandated safety standards is difficult and costly because crashworthiness standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. While we are managing our product development and production operations on a global basis to



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

reduce costs and lead times, unique national or regional standards or vehicle rating programs can result in additional costs for product development, testing and manufacturing. Governments often require the implementation of new requirements during the middle of a product cycle, which can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these requirements during the design of a new product.

The costs and effect on our reputation of product recalls could materially adversely affect our business.

From time to time we recall our products to address performance, compliance or safety-related issues. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. In addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Any costs incurred or lost sales caused by future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business. Conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above.

Item 2. Properties

At

December 31, 2013

we had 104 locations in 25 states and 81 cities or towns in the U.S. excluding our automotive financing operations and dealerships. Of these locations 40 are manufacturing facilities, of which 12 are engaged in the final assembly of our vehicles, other manufactured automotive components and power products. Of the remaining locations 24 are customer care and aftersales operations primarily responsible for distribution and warehouse functions and the remainder are offices or facilities primarily involved in engineering and testing vehicles. Leased properties are primarily composed of warehouses and administration, engineering and sales offices.

We have 16 locations in Canada and we have assembly, manufacturing, distribution, office or warehousing operations in 59 other countries, including equity interests in associated companies which perform assembly, manufacturing or distribution operations. The major facilities outside the U.S. and Canada, which are principally vehicle manufacturing and assembly operations, are located in:

We, our subsidiaries, or associated companies in which we own an equity interest, own most of the above facilities.

GM Financial's automotive financing and leasing operations lease facilities for administration and regional credit centers. GM Financial has 20 facilities located in 15 states and 20 cities or towns in the U.S. Of these facilities, three are collections centers, 14 are regional credit centers and the remaining facilities are administrative offices. GM Financial has three facilities located in Canada including one collection center and 26 facilities in European and Latin American countries. The major facilities outside the U.S. and Canada are located in the United Kingdom and Brazil.

Our properties include facilities which, in our opinion, are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

The following section summarizes material pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business. We and the other defendants affiliated with us intend to defend all of the following actions vigorously.

GMCL Dealers' Claim

General Motors of Canada Limited (GMCL) is defending a class action asserted on behalf of over 200 former GMCL dealers (the Plaintiff Dealers) which entered into wind-down agreements with GMCL in May 2009 asserting various claims related to those agreements. On March 1, 2011 the Ontario Superior Court of Justice approved certification of a class for the purpose of deciding a number of specifically defined issues including: (1) whether GMCL breached its obligation of “good faith” in offering the wind-down agreements; (2) whether GMCL interfered with the Plaintiff Dealers' rights of free association; (3) whether GMCL was obligated to provide a disclosure statement and/or disclose more specific information regarding its restructuring plans in connection with proffering the wind-down agreements; and (4) assuming liability, whether the Plaintiff Dealers can recover damages in the aggregate (as opposed to proving individual damages). A number of former dealers have opted out of participation in the litigation, leaving 181 dealers in the certified class. The parties are currently conducting discovery. Trial of the class issues is scheduled to occur in the third quarter of 2014.

UAW Claim

On April 6, 2010 the UAW filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan claiming that we breached our obligation to contribute $450 million to the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (New VEBA). The UAW alleges that we were contractually required to make this contribution pursuant to the UAW-Delphi-GM Memorandum of Understanding Delphi Restructuring dated June 22, 2007. We believe this claim is without merit. On December 10, 2013 the court granted our motion for summary judgment and dismissed the claims asserted by the UAW, holding that the relevant agreement is unambiguous and does not require the payment sought. The UAW has appealed.

GM Korea Wage Litigation

Commencing on or about September 29, 2010 current and former hourly employees of GM Korea filed eight separate group actions in the Incheon District Court in Incheon, Korea. The cases, which in aggregate involve more than 10,000 employees, allege that GM Korea failed to include bonuses and certain allowances in its calculation of Ordinary Wages due under the Presidential Decree of the Korean Labor Standards Act. On November 23, 2012 the Seoul High Court (an intermediate level appellate court) issued a decision affirming a decision of the Incheon District Court in a case involving five GM Korea employees which was contrary to GM Korea's position. GM Korea appealed to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea (Supreme Court) and initiated a constitutional challenge to the adverse interpretation of the relevant statute. In December 2013 the Supreme Court rendered a decision in a case involving another company not affiliated with us which addressed many of the issues presented in the cases pending against GM Korea and resolved many of them in a manner which we believe is favorable to GM Korea. In particular, while the Supreme Court held that fixed bonuses should be included in the calculation of Ordinary Wages, it also held that claims for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstances. We believe the Supreme Court’s reasoning is applicable to GM Korea, even though GM Korea’s case remains pending before the Supreme Court. Accordingly we have eliminated the accrual associated with these cases.

Inventory Management Securities Class Action

On June 29, 2012 a putative securities class action was filed against us and a number of our past and current officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (George G. Scott v. General Motors Company et al). Purporting to sue on behalf of owners of common stock deriving from our 2010 initial public offering, plaintiff asserts non-fraud prospectus based liability claims under various federal securities statutes alleging that the Company has made false statements about its vehicle inventory controls and production decisions, particularly with respect to fullsize trucks. The plaintiff's complaint requests compensatory damages, rescission and litigation costs, fees and disbursements. On November 21, 2012 the court appointed the Teamster's Local 710 Pension Fund as lead plaintiff in the matter.  On February 1, 2013 the plaintiff filed an amended complaint.

Saab Automobile AB Related Litigation

On August 6, 2012 Saab Automobile AB and Spyker N.V. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that GM tortuously interfered with their efforts to secure an investment in Saab Automobile AB from



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., Ltd and its affiliates by making public statements in December of 2011 to the effect that we did not favor the proposed transaction. The complaint alleges that absent the challenged statements, Saab Automobile AB would have successfully avoided liquidation and seeks damages of not less than $3.0 billion representing the projected value of Saab Automobile AB through 2016 plus pre- and post-judgment interest, special, punitive and other allowable damages and plaintiffs' reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. On June 18, 2013 the court granted GM’s motion to dismiss the case on multiple alternative grounds. Saab Automobile AB and Spyker N.V. have appealed.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Information

Shares of our common stock have been publicly traded since November 18, 2010 when our common stock was listed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The following table summarizes the quarterly price ranges of our common stock based on high and low prices from intraday trades on the New York Stock Exchange, the principal market in which the stock is traded:

Holders

At

January 30, 2014

we had a total of 1.6 billion issued and outstanding shares of common stock held by 403 holders of record.

Dividends

So long as any share of our Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid on our Series A Preferred Stock, subject to exceptions, such as dividends on our common stock payable solely in shares of our common stock. Our secured revolving credit facilities contain certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, subject to exceptions, such as dividends payable solely in shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2013 there were no dividends in arrears on our Series A Preferred Stock.

Since our formation, we had not paid any dividends on our common stock through the year ended December 31, 2013. In January 2014 our Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock in the amount of

$0.30

per share payable in March 2014. It is anticipated that dividends on our common stock will be declared and paid quarterly subsequent to the initial dividend declaration. However our payment of dividends in the future, if any, will be determined by our Board of Directors and will be paid out of funds legally available for that purpose. Our payment of dividends in the future will depend on business conditions, our financial condition, earnings, liquidity and capital requirements, the covenants in our secured revolving credit facilities and other factors.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Purchases of Equity Securities for Cash

No shares of common stock were purchased for cash in each of the three months ended December 31, 2013.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Basis of Presentation

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We analyze the results of our business through our five segments: GMNA, GME, GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial. Consistent with industry practice, market share information includes estimates of industry sales in certain countries where public reporting is not legally required or otherwise available on a consistent basis.

In the three months ended March 31, 2013 we changed our managerial and financial reporting structure to measure our reportable segments revenue and profitability based on the geographic area in which we sell vehicles to third party customers. We have retrospectively revised the segment presentation for all periods presented. Refer to

Note 25

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on this change.

Overview

Automotive

Our vision is to design, build and sell the world’s best vehicles. The primary elements of our strategy to achieve this vision are to:

•

Deliver a product portfolio of the world’s best vehicles that includes cars, crossovers and trucks, allowing us to maximize sales under any market condition;

•

Sell our vehicles globally by targeting developed markets, which are projected to have increases in vehicle demand as the global economy recovers, and further strengthening our position in high growth emerging markets;

•

Improve revenue realization and maintain a competitive cost structure to allow us to remain profitable at lower industry volumes and across the lifecycle of our product portfolio;

•

Maintain a strong balance sheet by reducing financial leverage given the high operating leverage of our business model; and

•

Ensure that our dealers and customers have consistently available, transparent and competitive financing options through GM Financial and other providers.

We are committed to leadership in vehicle design, quality, reliability, telematics and infotainment and safety, as well as to developing key energy efficiency, energy diversity and advanced propulsion technologies, including electric vehicles. Our business is diversified across products and geographic markets. We meet the local sales and service needs of our retail and fleet customers with a global network of independent dealers.

GMNA

GMNA has sales, manufacturing and distribution operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and sales and distribution operations in Central America and the Caribbean. GMNA represented

51.1%

of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in


and we had the largest market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in North America at

16.9%

. We grew our retail market share in all four brands as compared to 2012. Our market share growth was driven in part by the success of several product launches during the year, most notably the Corvette Stingray, Chevrolet Impala, Cadillac CTS and the all-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size trucks. Our products in the region continued to receive recognitions of excellence including the most initial quality awards as determined by JD Power and Associates as compared to any other automotive manufacturer in 2013.

GME

GME has sales, manufacturing and distribution operations across Western and Central Europe. GME's wholesale vehicle sales volume, which in addition to Western and Central Europe, includes Eastern Europe (including Russia and the other members of



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

the Commonwealth of Independent States among others) represented

16.3%

of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in


. In


we estimate we had the number four market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in Europe at

8.3%

. GMIO distributed Chevrolet brand vehicles in Europe. These vehicles are reported within market share for Europe, but wholesale vehicle sales volume is recorded by GMIO. Our European operations continue to show signs of improvement underscored by our first Opel and Vauxhall market share increase in 14 years. This market share increase was partially driven by the successful launches of the Opel Mokka, ADAM and Cascada during


. Our focus on successfully executing product launches and containing costs has in part contributed to significant year-over-year reduction in EBIT (loss)-adjusted.

In an effort to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in GME, we reached agreement with the labor union in Germany to terminate all vehicle and transmission production at our Bochum, Germany facility by the end of 2014. Affected employees will be eligible for a voluntary restructuring separation program. Restructuring charges will be recorded primarily through 2014. Refer to

Note 19

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

GMIO

GMIO has sales, manufacturing and distribution operations in Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe (including Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States among others). GMIO represented

16.2%

of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in


. The Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region is our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented 40.0% of our global retail vehicle sales volume in


. In


we estimate we had the number two market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa at

9.5%

. In


we had market share of

14.3%

in China. GMIO records the wholesale unit volume and financial results of Chevrolet brand vehicles that it distributes and sells in Europe. Our international operations' results were highlighted by our continued strength in China where we sold over

3 million

vehicles. Our strength in the market was in part driven by the successful launches of the new Cadillac XTS, the refreshed Buick LaCrosse and Regal and certain Wuling branded vehicles, as well as continued strong sales of the Buick Encore and Buick Excelle. Our Buick brand continues to be our strongest brand in China with 810,000 vehicles sold in 2013 an increase of 16% from the prior year. In addition we have been making investments in our Cadillac brand in China which included a new assembly plant in Shanghai.

We are addressing many of the challenges in our GMIO operations and have performed strategic assessments on the performance and the manner in which we operate in certain countries. While we are continuing our strategic assessments we announced plans to discontinue offering mainstream Chevrolet vehicles in Europe in 2015 and recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges; announced plans to cease manufacturing at GM Holden Ltd., our subsidiary in Australia (Holden), and recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges; recorded asset impairment charges at GM India; and impaired our remaining goodwill in GMIO. Refer to the "GM International Operations" section of MD&A and Notes


,


and


to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Our GM Korea subsidiary has continuing litigation with more than 10,000 current and former employees over the definition of ordinary wages. As a result of the recent Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea’s favorable decision on a very similar wage litigation case involving another company we now believe an unfavorable outcome on our case given the new precedent is no longer probable and we reversed certain accruals for our cases. Refer to

Note 17

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

GMSA

GMSA has sales, manufacturing, distribution and/or financing operations in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela as well as sales and distribution operations in Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. GMSA represented

16.4%

of our wholesale vehicle sales volume in


. In


GMSA derived 63.5% of its wholesale vehicle sales volume from Brazil. In


we estimate we had the number one market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in South America at

17.5%

and the number three market share, based upon retail vehicle sales, in Brazil at

17.3%

. Despite foreign currency pressures and challenging political environments across the region, our South American operations experienced continued profitability in


that was driven in part by successful product launches including the Chevrolet Onix, Prisma and Tracker. We have further addressed our cost structure through restructuring efforts and multi-year labor agreements in Brazil.

Our Venezuelan operations highlight some of the foreign currency and political pressures. In 2013 the Venezuelan government announced a change in the official fixed exchange rate which resulted in devaluation charges during the year. In addition to currency controls already in place, the Venezuelan government announced pricing controls that, taken with other initiatives, require us to



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

closely monitor and consider our ability to manage and control our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Refer to the "GM South America" section of MD&A for additional information.

Corporate

We continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet. Initiatives during 2013 included lowering our cost of capital and increased financial flexibility by issuing $4.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. We used proceeds from the issuance to prepay notes issued to the Canadian Health Care Trust (HCT) and to purchase 120 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock from the New VEBA. Refer to Notes


and


to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As part of an effort to release capital from non-core assets and further enhance our financial flexibility we sold our common equity ownership in Ally Financial and our seven percent equity interest in PSA held by GME. Refer to Notes


and


to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

The United States Treasury divested its remaining ownership stake in our common stock. Also, all of our shares of Series B Preferred Stock mandatorily converted into

137 million

shares of our common stock and will result in future annual cash preferred stock dividend savings. Refer to

Note 21

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Through ongoing discussions with taxing authorities we remeasured an uncertain tax position resulting in a tax benefit that will reduce future cash taxes.

Our collective actions during 2013 have helped us achieve investment grade status with a rating agency and we were added to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500.

Automotive Outlook

We anticipate the 2014 global automotive industry to be up approximately 2% over 2013 or about 85 million vehicles. For 2014 we expect our biggest challenges will be associated with unfavorable foreign currency pressures and planned global restructuring charges of up to $1.1 billion. However we expect to substantially offset these challenges with favorable pricing and by leveraging our continued strength in North America and China. We continue to progress toward our target of mid- to high-single digit margins for mid-decade and expect our 2014 EBIT-adjusted margins to be comparable to 2013. We are also committed to returning capital to our common stockholders and in January 2014 our Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock in the amount of

$0.30

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

GM Financial purchases automobile finance contracts originated by GM and non-GM franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles. GM Financial also offers a lease financing product for new GM vehicles and a commercial lending program for GM-franchised dealerships. GM Financial's lending products in North America are primarily offered to consumers who typically are unable to obtain financing from traditional sources such as banks and credit unions. GM Financial utilizes a proprietary credit scoring system to differentiate credit applications and to statistically rank-order credit risk in terms of expected default rates, which enables it to evaluate credit applications for approval and tailor loan and lease pricing and structure. GM Financial services its loan and lease portfolios at regional centers using automated servicing and collection systems. Funding for our auto finance activities is primarily obtained through the utilization of our credit facilities and through securitization transactions.

In November 2012 GM Financial entered into agreements with Ally Financial to acquire Ally Financial's automotive finance and financial services businesses in Europe and Latin America and Ally Financial's equity interest in GMAC-SAIC that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in China. The acquisitions will allow GM Financial to support our dealers in markets comprising approximately 80% of our global sales. In the year ended December 31, 2013 GM Financial completed the acquisitions of the operations in Europe and Latin America for

$3.3 billion

. GM Financial's acquisition of Ally Financial's equity interest in GMAC-SAIC is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals and is expected to close in 2014 for approximately

$0.9 billion

Reconciliation of Consolidated, Automotive and GM Financial Segment Results

Non-GAAP Measures

Management believes earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)-adjusted provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our automotive segments' operating results because it excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments. Such adjustments include impairment charges related to goodwill, other long-lived assets under certain circumstances and certain investments, gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations and gains or losses on the sale of non-core investments.

Management believes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the liquidity of our automotive operations and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow above those required in our business to sustain our operations. We measure free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We measure adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet, such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans.

Management believes these measures allow it to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions. We believe these non-GAAP measures are useful in allowing for greater transparency of our core operations and are therefore used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Management does not consider the excluded items when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the organization, its management teams and when making decisions to allocate resources, such as capital investment, among business units and for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes.

While management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information, they are not operating measures under U.S. GAAP and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other measures such as Net income, Net income attributable to stockholders or operating cash flow. Due to these limitations, these non-GAAP measures are used as supplements to U.S. GAAP measures.

Management believes income before income taxes provides meaningful supplemental information regarding GM Financial's operating results. GM Financial uses a separate measure from our automotive operations because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.

The following tables summarize the reconciliation of our automotive segments EBIT-adjusted and GM Financial's income before income taxes to Net income attributable to stockholders and provides supplemental detail of the adjustments, which are presented net of noncontrolling interests (dollars in millions):



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Our automotive operations interest and income taxes are recorded centrally in Corporate; therefore, there are no reconciling items for our automotive operating segments between EBIT-adjusted and Net income attributable to stockholders.

GM North America

GMNA Total Net Sales and Revenue



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

In the year ended December 31, 2013 Total net sales and revenue increased due primarily to: (1) favorable vehicle pricing related to recent vehicle launches such as Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra; (2) increased wholesale volumes due to increased industry demand and successful recent vehicle launches such as the Buick Encore, Cadillac ATS, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Spark, and GMC Sierra; and (3) favorable vehicle mix related to improving market segments containing higher revenue vehicles including crossovers and trucks.

In the year ended December 31, 2012 Total net sales and revenue increased due primarily to: (1) increased wholesale volumes due to increased industry demand and successful recent vehicle launches such as the Buick Verano, Cadillac ATS, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Sonic and Chevrolet Spark; (2) favorable vehicle mix due to increases in Cadillac ATS, Cadillac XTS, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra; and (3) favorable vehicle pricing related to recent vehicle launches such as Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave; partially offset by (4) Other of $1.1 billion due primarily to reduction in favorable lease residual adjustments of $0.5 billion; and unfavorable net foreign currency effect of $0.2 billion due to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar (CAD) and Mexican Peso against the U.S. Dollar.

GMNA EBIT-Adjusted

The most significant factors which influence GMNA's profitability are industry volume (primarily U.S. seasonally adjusted annual rate) and market share. While not as significant as industry volume and market share, another factor affecting profitability is the relative mix of vehicles (cars, trucks, crossovers) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense, and policy and warranty expense. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. Trucks sold in the U.S. currently have a variable profit of approximately 160% of our portfolio on a weighted-average basis. Crossover vehicles' variable profits are in line with the overall portfolio on a weighted-average basis, and cars are approximately 50% of the portfolio on a weighted-average basis.

In the year ended December 31, 2013 EBIT-adjusted increased due primarily to: (1) favorable vehicle pricing; and (2) increased wholesale volumes; partially offset by (3) unfavorable Other of $1.4 billion primarily due to increased material and freight costs including new launches of $1.1 billion; increased manufacturing expense, including new launches, of $0.3 billion; increased engineering expense of $0.3 billion; and increased depreciation and amortization expense of $0.2 billion, partially offset by a reduction in unfavorable warranty and policy adjustments of $0.6 billion.

In the year ended December 31, 2012 EBIT-adjusted decreased due primarily to: (1) unfavorable vehicle mix due to increase in lower margin vehicles; and (2) Other of $1.3 billion due primarily to decreased U.S. pension income of $0.8 billion due to December 31, 2011 plan remeasurements; increased manufacturing expense, including new launches, of $0.6 billion; reduction in favorable lease residual adjustments of $0.5 billion; and unfavorable policy and warranty adjustments of $0.2 billion; partially offset by decreased engineering expense and other technology fees of $0.5 billion; and decreased material and freight costs of $0.4 billion. These were partially offset by: (3) increased net wholesale volumes; and (4) favorable vehicle pricing effect.

GM Europe

During the second half of 2011 and continuing into 2013, the European automotive industry has been severely affected by high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with manufacturing overcapacity. European automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers were

19 million

vehicles in the year ended

December 31, 2013

, representing a

1.1%

decrease compared to the corresponding period in 2012.

Outlook

We have formulated a plan and are implementing various actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness. The key areas include investments in our product portfolio, a revised brand strategy, significant management changes, reducing material, development and production costs, including restructuring activities. The success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated, as well as external factors which are outside of our control. We believe it is likely that adverse economic conditions and their effect on the European automotive industry will not improve significantly in the near-term; however, we expect to break even in GME by mid-decade.

GME Total Net Sales and Revenue and EBIT (Loss)-Adjusted



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

GME Total Net Sales and Revenue

In the year ended December 31, 2013 Total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased wholesale volumes due to the weak European economy; and (2) unfavorable vehicle pricing primarily resulting from increased incentive support associated with difficult market conditions; partially offset by (3) Other of

$0.2 billion

due primarily to favorable net foreign currency effect.

In the year ended December 31, 2012 Total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased wholesale volumes due to the weak European economy; (2) unfavorable price effects primarily resulting from increased incentive support associated with strong competition; and (3) Other of

GM International Operations

We have strategically assessed the manner in which we operate in certain countries within GMIO, including our cost structure, the level of local sourcing, the level of investment in the product portfolio, the allocation of production activity to the existing manufacturing base and our brand strategy. These strategic reviews considered the effects that recent and forecasted deterioration



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

in local market conditions would have on our operations. While we are continuing our strategic assessments, we have taken certain actions and incurred impairment and other charges as detailed below.

Withdrawal of the Chevrolet Brand from Europe

In December 2013 we announced our plans to cease mainstream distribution of Chevrolet brand in Western and Central Europe in 2015 due to the challenging business model and difficult economic situation in Europe. The results of our Chevrolet operations in Western and Central Europe, which are subsidiaries of our GM Korea operations, are reflected in the financial results of our GMIO region. This action is expected to improve our European operations through a further strengthening of our Opel and Vauxhall brands and reduce the market complexity associated with both Opel and Chevrolet products in Western and Central Europe. In the three months ended December 31, 2013 we recorded pre-tax charges of

$0.6 billion

, net of noncontrolling interests of 23.0%, consisting of intangible asset impairment charges, dealer restructuring costs, sales incentive and inventory related costs and employee severance and other costs. We may incur additional charges of up to

$0.3 billion

through the first half of 2014 primarily for dealer restructuring costs and sales incentives. Refer to Note


of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Holden

In December 2013 we announced plans to cease vehicle and engine manufacturing and significantly reduce engineering operations at Holden by the end of 2017. Holden will continue to sell imported vehicles through its Holden dealer network and maintain its global design studio. Our Australian operations have been subject to unfavorable market conditions including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production and a small but highly competitive and fragmented domestic automotive market. In the three months ended December 31, 2013 we recorded pre-tax charges of

$0.5 billion

consisting of asset impairment charges including property, plant and equipment and exit-related costs including certain employee severance related costs. We expect to incur additional charges through 2017 for incremental future cash payments of employee severance once negotiations of the amount are completed. Refer to Note


of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

GM India

In the three months ended December 31, 2013 we performed a strategic assessment of GM India in response to lower than expected sales performance of our current product offerings in India, higher raw material costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and recent deterioration in local market conditions. As a result we recorded pre-tax asset impairment charges of $0.3 billion, net of noncontrolling interests of 9.2%, to adjust the carrying amount of GM India’s real and personal property, Intangible assets, net and Goodwill. Our strategic assessment also outlines planned actions requiring additional future investments and modifications to our existing GM India business model that are needed to reach profitability in the medium to long-term. There are no assurances that the forecasted financial results outlined in the strategic assessment will be achieved. Refer to Note


of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Goodwill Impairment Charges

We recorded Goodwill impairment charges of

$0.5 billion

in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily related to our GM Korea and GM India reporting units.

Focus on Chinese Market

We view the Chinese market as important to our global growth strategy and are employing a multi-brand strategy, led by our Buick and Chevrolet brands. In the coming years, we plan to increasingly leverage our global architectures to increase the number of nameplates under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands in China and continue to grow our business under the Baojun, Jiefang and Wuling brands. We operate in the Chinese market through a number of joint ventures and maintaining good relations with our joint venture partners, which are affiliated with the Chinese government, is an important part of our China growth strategy.

and


to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on the acquisition of GM India.

In the year ended

December 31, 2013

Total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) decreased wholesale volume of 129,000 vehicles (or 11.6%) primarily in Middle East and Chevrolet brand vehicles in Europe partially offset by an increase from the consolidation of GM India effective September 2012 resulting in an additional 57,000 wholesale vehicle sales (or 5.0%) in 2013; (2) unfavorable pricing due to increased incentive support associated with strong competition; (3) unfavorable vehicle mix; and (4) Other of $0.8 billion due primarily to unfavorable net foreign currency effect due to the weakening of the Australian Dollar, the South Africa Rand and the Egyptian Pound against the U.S. Dollar of $0.5 billion and decreased sales of components, parts and accessories of $0.3 billion.

GMIO EBIT-Adjusted



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

In the year ended

December 31, 2013

EBIT-adjusted decreased due primarily to: (1) unfavorable net vehicle mix primarily in Middle East and Australian markets; (2) unfavorable pricing excluding $0.2 billion sales incentive related to withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe; (3) unfavorable net wholesale volumes; and (4) Other of $0.2 billion due primarily to unfavorable manufacturing costs of $0.3 billion; unfavorable net foreign currency effect of $0.2 billion; and a decrease in sales of components, parts and accessories of $0.2 billion; partially offset by favorable material and freight cost of $0.3 billion; and increased equity income, net of tax of $0.2 billion, from our interest in the increased net income of our China JVs.

In the year ended

EBIT-adjusted increased due primarily to: (1) favorable pricing due to higher pricing on new models launched; and (2) favorable net wholesale volumes; partially offset by (3) unfavorable net vehicle mix; and (4) Other of $0.9 billion due primarily to increased costs of $1.0 billion due primarily to increased material, freight and manufacturing costs; partially offset by net gain of $0.1 billion measured as the difference between the fair value of our 50% interest in GM India and the investment carrying amount at the date of acquisition.

GM South America

Venezuelan Operations

Our Venezuelan subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. Dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the Venezuelan economy.

Effective February 13, 2013 the Venezuelan government set the official fixed exchange rate of the Bolivar Fuerte (BsF) at BsF 6.3 to $1.00 from BsF 4.3 to $1.00. The devaluation resulted in a charge of

$0.2 billion

in the three months ended March 31, 2013 from the remeasurement of our Venezuelan subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

We believe it is possible that the Venezuelan government may further devalue the BsF against the U.S. Dollar in the future. If the BsF were devalued further, it would result in a charge to our income statement in the period of devaluation. Based on our December 31, 2013 net monetary assets, a charge of approximately $0.1 billion would result for every 10% devaluation of the BsF.

In December 2013 a new decree became effective requiring the government of Venezuela to set prices for all vehicles, parts and accessories sold in the country. In addition the Venezuelan government has foreign exchange control regulations that make it difficult to convert BsF to U.S. Dollars which affect our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ ability to pay non-BsF denominated obligations and to pay dividends. In January 2014 the Venezuelan government announced changes to the foreign exchange process which could affect the rate at which our Venezuelan subsidiaries buy dollars. These regulations, when considered with other governmental policies impacting labor force reductions and other circumstances in Venezuela, may limit our ability to fully benefit from and maintain our controlling financial interest in our Venezuelan subsidiaries. The financial impact on our operations in Venezuela of these events and associated ongoing restrictions are uncertain.

The total amounts pending government approval for settlement in U.S. Dollar at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were BsF 3.7 billion (equivalent to $0.6 billion) and BsF 2.2 billion (equivalent to $0.5 billion). These amounts include requests in the amount of BsF 0.6 billion (equivalent to $0.1 billion) that have been pending from 2007. Our Venezuelan subsidiaries net assets were $0.9 billion at December 31, 2013, including net monetary assets of $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2013 other consolidated entities had receivables from our Venezuelan subsidiaries denominated in other currencies of $0.5 billion.

GMSA Total Net Sales and Revenue

In the year ended December 31, 2013 Total net sales and revenue decreased due primarily to: (1) Other of $1.7 billion due primarily to unfavorable net foreign currency effect due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real and Argentinian Peso and the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar of $1.9 billion; partially offset by increased revenue from parts and accessories sales of $0.1 billion; partially offset by (2) favorable vehicle pricing primarily due to high inflation in Venezuela and Argentina; and (3) favorable vehicle mix due to increased sales of the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Chevrolet Captiva, Chevrolet Orlando, Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet S10.

In the year ended December 31, 2012 Total net sales and revenue increased due primarily to: (1) favorable vehicle mix due to increased sales of Chevrolet Cruze and Chevrolet S10; and (2) favorable vehicle pricing primarily due to high inflation in Venezuela and Argentina; partially offset by (3) decreased wholesale volumes due to deteriorated market share driven by increased competition and aggressive pricing in the market; and (4) Other of $1.4 billion due primarily to unfavorable net foreign currency effect due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Brazilian Real and Argentinian Peso and the devaluation of the BsF of $1.5 billion; partially offset by increased revenue from parts and accessories sales of $0.1 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity Overview

We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our secured revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. However we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. Our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are centered around three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) continue to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position; and (3) return cash to shareholders. Our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately

$7.5 billion

annually as well as engineering and product development activities; (2) acquiring Ally Financial's equity interests in GMAC-SAIC, as subsequently discussed, for approximately

$0.9 billion

; (3) payments for previously announced restructuring activities of up to $1.1 billion; (4) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations; (5) payments to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation amount of

$3.9 billion

once the shares become redeemable on or after December 31, 2014; and (6) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors.

Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this 2013 Form 10-K, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans.

Recent Management Initiatives

We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position over the long-term. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations while maintaining minimal financial leverage as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. These actions may include additional loans, investments with our joint venture partners or the acquisitions of certain operations or ownership stakes in outside businesses. These actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the short-term.

In November 2012 GM Financial entered into agreements with Ally Financial to acquire Ally Financial's automotive finance and financial services businesses in Europe and Latin America and Ally Financial's equity interests in GMAC-SAIC for approximately

$4.2 billion

. GM Financial has completed the acquisitions of Ally Financial's European and Latin American automotive finance operations for

$3.3 billion

in 2013. Increases in GM Financial receivables and GM Financial Short-term and Long-term debt in 2013 compared to 2012 were due primarily to the acquisition. Refer to

Note 3

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions.

In April 2013 GM Korea made a payment of $0.7 billion to acquire, prior to the mandatory redemption date, the remaining balance of GM Korea's seven percent mandatorily redeemable preferred shares that had a carrying amount of $0.5 billion. We recorded the difference of $0.2 billion as a loss on extinguishment of debt.

In September 2013 we issued $4.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes comprising $1.5 billion of 3.5% notes due in 2018, $1.5 billion of 4.875% notes due in 2023 and $1.5 billion of 6.25% notes due in 2043. We used proceeds from the issuance of these notes to purchase 120 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock from the New VEBA for a total



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

price of $3.2 billion, which was equal to 108.1% of their aggregate liquidation amount. The Series A Preferred Stock accrues cumulative dividends at a 9% annual rate. We recorded a loss for the difference between the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased of $2.4 billion and the consideration paid of $3.2 billion, which reduced Net income attributable to common stockholders by $0.8 billion.

In October 2013 we used proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured notes to make a payment of $1.2 billion to prepay notes issued to the HCT. The HCT notes accrued interest at a 7% annual rate. This transaction and the purchase of the Series A Preferred Stock from the New VEBA lowered our overall cost of funding as the senior unsecured notes carry a lower interest rate than the dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the interest rate on the HCT notes.

In December 2013 we sold our investment in Ally Financial’s common stock for $0.9 billion. Also in December 2013 we sold our seven percent equity stake in PSA for $0.3 billion. These transactions released capital from non-core investment assets and allow the funds to be used for other corporate purposes.

Automotive

Available Liquidity

Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. At

December 31, 2013

our total available liquidity was

$38.3 billion

, including funds available under credit facilities of

$10.4 billion

. The amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.

We manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. Available liquidity held within North America and at our regional treasury centers represented approximately

84%

of our available liquidity at December 31, 2013. A portion of our available liquidity includes amounts deemed indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.

Our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits and corporate debt securities, and are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars. We expect to maintain a sufficient amount of CAD denominated cash investments to offset certain CAD denominated liabilities, which primarily relate to pension and OPEB liabilities. These cash investments will incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses based on the movement of the CAD in relation to the U.S. Dollar and will therefore reduce our net CAD foreign currency exchange exposure. We held cash investments in CAD denominated securities of

$1.7 billion

at

December 31, 2013

. These funds continue to be available to fund our normal ongoing operations and are included in our available liquidity.

Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. Substantially all of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.

We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity and to fund working capital needs at certain of our subsidiaries. The total size of our credit facilities was

$11.2 billion

and

$11.4 billion

at

December 31, 2013

and 2012. Our primary borrowing capacity under credit facilities comes from our secured revolving credit facilities comprising a three-year, $5.5 billion facility maturing in 2015 and a five-year, $5.5 billion facility maturing in 2017. We have not borrowed against these facilities, but have amounts in use under the letter of credit sub-facility of

$0.6 billion

at

December 31, 2013

. GM Financial has not borrowed against the three-year facility. Refer to

Note 14

Depreciation, amortization and impairments included goodwill impairments of $0.5 billion, $27.1 billion and $1.3 billion and impairment charges of property and intangible assets of $1.4 billion, $5.5 billion and $0.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. In the year ended December 31, 2012 significant Pension and OPEB activities included contributions to the U.S. salaried pension plan of $2.3 billion for the purchase of annuity contracts and associated pension settlement charges of $2.7 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2011 significant Pension and OPEB activities included a cash contribution as part of the HCT settlement of $0.8 billion and a gain associated with the HCT settlement of $0.7 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2012 Other was due primarily to favorable movements in dealer and customer allowances of $0.9 billion, other deferred tax provisions of $0.9 billion and policy and warranty of $0.6 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2011 Other was due primarily to gains on the sale of our investments in New Delphi Class A Membership Interests and Ally Financial preferred stock of $2.0 billion, unfavorable movements in accrued and other liabilities of $0.7 billion and equipment on operating leases of $0.5 billion.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Changes in the (Acquisitions) liquidations of marketable securities, net were due to varying maturities of investments as we rebalanced our investment portfolio in the normal course of business. Other was due primarily to the release of restricted cash, including the release of $1.0 billion associated with the implementation of the HCT in the year ended December 31, 2011.

Other was due primarily to prepayments on debt facilities held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily in GMNA and GMSA, of $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2011.

Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow

The following table summarizes free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (dollars in millions):

Adjustments to free cash flow included the following items: accrued interest on the prepayment of the HCT notes of $0.2 billion in October 2013 and pension contributions of $0.1 billion related to the previously announced annuitization of the U.S. salaried pension plan in March 2013; voluntary contributions to the U.S. salaried pension plan of $2.3 billion for the purchase of annuity contracts and the premium paid to purchase our common stock from the UST of $0.4 billion in December 2012; termination of in-transit wholesale advance agreement in GMNA resulting in an increase to accounts receivable of $1.1 billion and OPEB payments relating to the HCT settlement of $0.8 billion in 2011.

Status of Credit Ratings



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

We receive ratings from four independent credit rating agencies: DBRS Limited, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and S&P. DBRS Limited and Moody's currently rate our corporate credit at investment grade while Fitch and S&P currently rate our corporate credit at non-investment grade. The following table summarizes our credit ratings at January 30, 2014:

Rating actions taken by each of the credit rating agencies from January 1, 2013 through January 30, 2014 were as follows:

Fitch: September - Assigned a senior unsecured rating of BB+. August - Upgraded their outlook to positive from stable.

Moody’s: September - Upgraded corporate rating to an investment grade rating of Baa3 from Ba1, assigned a senior unsecured rating of Ba1 and changed their outlook to stable from positive.

S&P: September - Assigned a senior unsecured rating of BB+ and upgraded their outlook to positive from stable.

We continue to pursue investment grade status from all of the credit rating agencies by maintaining a balance sheet with minimal financial leverage and demonstrating continued operating performance. Achieving investment grade status will provide us with greater financial flexibility, lower our cost of borrowing and may release collateral from certain agreements including our secured revolving credit facility.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

Liquidity Overview

GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income, servicing fees, net distributions from secured debt, borrowings under secured and unsecured debt, net proceeds from senior notes transactions and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of finance receivables and leased vehicles, funding of commercial finance receivables, business acquisitions, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements for secured debt, operating expenses and interest costs. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt.

Available Liquidity

The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity for daily operations (dollars in millions):

The increase in liquidity is due primarily to the net increase of $0.8 billion resulting from the Ally Financial international operations acquisition.

GM Financial has the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion against our three-year $5.5 billion secured revolving credit facility subject to available capacity and borrowing base restrictions. In the event GM Financial borrows against the facility, it is expected such borrowings would be short-term in nature. The facility is not guaranteed or secured by any GM Financial assets or subsidiaries.

Credit Facilities



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

In the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured and structured as securitizations, or may be unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At December 31, 2013 secured and unsecured credit facilities totaled

$15.6 billion

and

$4.0 billion

, with advances outstanding of

$9.0 billion

and

$3.0 billion

.

GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. GM Financial’s secured credit facilities contain various covenants requiring minimum financial ratios, asset quality and portfolio performance ratios (portfolio net loss and delinquency ratios, and pool level cumulative net loss ratios) as well as limits on deferment levels. Failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurs under these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements, restrict GM Financial’s ability to obtain additional borrowings under these agreements and/or remove GM Financial as servicer. At December 31, 2013 GM Financial was in compliance with all covenants related to its credit facilities.

Cash Flow

The following table summarizes GM Financial cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (dollars in millions):

Operating Activities

In the year ended

December 31, 2013

net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.6 billion due primarily to the acquisitions of Ally Financial international operations.

In the year ended

December 31, 2012

net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.2 billion due primarily to higher revenues resulting from a $2.4 billion increase in average earning assets.

Investing Activities

In the year ended

December 31, 2013

net cash used in investing activities increased by $5.4 billion due primarily to: (1) increased funding of commercial finance receivables of $19.9 billion and purchase of consumer finance receivables of $4.0 billion; (2) net cash payment of $2.6 billion made in the current year on the acquisitions of Ally Financial international operations; (3) increased purchase of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion; and (4) increase in restricted cash of $0.6 billion; partially offset by (5) increased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $22.8 billion.

In the year ended

December 31, 2012

net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.7 billion due primarily to: (1) increased funding of commercial finance receivables of $1.2 billion and purchase of consumer finance receivables of $0.6 billion; and (2) increased purchase of leased vehicles of $0.2 billion; partially offset by (3) increased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $1.0 billion.

Financing Activities

In the year ended

December 31, 2013

net cash provided by financing activities increased by $2.8 billion due primarily to the increased borrowings under secured and unsecured debt and issuance of senior notes of $14.0 billion, partially offset by the increased debt repayment of $9.7 billion and the repayment of $1.4 billion in certain debt assumed as part of the Ally Financial international operations acquisitions.

In the year ended

December 31, 2012

net cash provided by financing activities increased by $0.8 billion due primarily to a decrease in repayment of debt.

Defined Benefit Pension Plan Contributions



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Eligible U.S. salaried employees hired prior to January 2001 participated in a defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of September 30, 2012. All eligible salaried employees now participate in a defined contribution plan. Hourly employees hired prior to October 2007 generally participate in plans which provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of service as well as supplemental benefits for employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age. Hourly employees hired after September 2007 participate in a defined contribution plan. Our policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulation, or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. At

December 31, 2013

all legal funding requirements had been met. We expect to contribute

$0.1 billion

to our U.S. non-qualified plans and

$0.7 billion

to our non-U.S. pension plans in


.

The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans or direct payments (dollars in millions):

We provided short-term, interest-free, unsecured loans of

$2.2 billion

to provide the U.S. salaried defined benefit pension plan with incremental liquidity to pay ongoing benefits and administrative costs. Through December 31, 2013 contributions of

$1.7 billion

were made from the

$2.2 billion

loans and the remaining amounts were repaid.

We made a voluntary contribution in January 2011 to our U.S. hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans of 61 million shares of our common stock valued at $2.2 billion for funding purposes at the time of contribution. The contributed shares qualified as a plan asset for funding purposes at the time of contribution and as a plan asset valued at $1.9 billion for accounting purposes in July 2011. This was a voluntary contribution above our funding requirements for the pension plans.

The following table summarizes the underfunded status of pension plans on a U.S. GAAP basis (dollars in millions):

The decrease in underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans was due primarily to: (1) actuarial gains due primarily to discount rate increases of $7.7 billion; (2) actual return on plan assets of $2.1 billion; and (3) contributions of $0.1 billion; partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $3.1 billion.

The decrease in underfunded status of the non-U.S. pension plans primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany was due primarily to: (1) actuarial gains due primarily to discount rate increases of $1.0 billion; (2) actual return on plan assets of $1.0 billion; and (3) contributions and benefit payments of $0.9 billion; partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $1.4 billion; (5) net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $0.2 billion; and (6) business combinations of $0.1 billion.

Hourly and salaried OPEB plans provide postretirement life insurance to certain U.S. retirees and eligible dependents and postretirement health coverage to some U.S. retirees and eligible dependents. Certain of the non-U.S. subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most participants are covered by government sponsored or administered programs.

Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities

We have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations. A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Other long-term liabilities are defined as long-term liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Based on this definition, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. The majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities.

The following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities at

December 31, 2013

(dollars in millions):



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

__________

(a)

Amounts include Automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and capital lease obligations. Automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at

December 31, 2013

.

(b)

GM Financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at

December 31, 2013

for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. GM Financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.

(c)

Amounts include OPEB payments under the current U.S. contractual labor agreements through 2015 and Canada labor agreements through 2016. Amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed below under the caption “Pension Funding Requirements.”

(d)

Amounts do not include future cash payments for long-term purchase obligations and other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above) which were recorded in Accounts payable or Accrued liabilities at

December 31, 2013

.

(e)

Amounts exclude the future annual contingent obligations of Euro 265 million in the years 2013 to 2014 related to our Opel/Vauxhall restructuring plan. Refer to

Note 17

to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.

(f)

Amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at

December 31, 2013

for OPEB obligations for salaried employees and hourly OPEB obligations extending beyond the current North American union contract agreements. Amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed below under the caption “Pension Funding Requirements.”

The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of

$2.5 billion

due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts.

Pension Funding Requirements

We have implemented and completed a balance sheet derisking strategy, comprising certain actions related to our U.S. salaried pension plan. These actions included payment of lump-sums to retirees, the purchase of group annuity contracts from an insurance company and the settlement of other previously guaranteed obligations.

We do not have any required contributions payable to our U.S. qualified plans in 2014. We expect to contribute

$0.1 billion

to our U.S. non-qualified plans and

$0.7 billion

to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2014.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. We have discussed the development, selection and disclosures of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to these estimates.

Pensions

The defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.

In December 2013 an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. The study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the U.S. pension plans with resulting changes to the expected long-term rate of return on assets. The weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets increased from

5.8%

at December 31, 2012 to

6.5%

at December 31, 2013 due primarily to higher yields on fixed income securities.

Another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations. We estimate this rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate.

Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial gain (loss) on our pension plans was $1.4 billion and $(6.2) billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012. The change is due primarily to the increase in discount rates.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

The following data illustrates the sensitivity of changes in pension expense and pension obligation based on the last remeasurement of the U.S. hourly pension plan at

December 31, 2013

Note 2

to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

We evaluate the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances based on a more likely than not standard. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year anticipated results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2013 we retained valuation allowances of

$10.8 billion

against deferred tax assets primarily in GME and South Korea business units with losses and in the U.S. and Canada related primarily to capital loss tax attributes and state operating loss carryforwards.

If law is enacted that reduces the U.S. statutory rate, we would record a significant reduction to the net deferred tax assets and a related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change.

Impairment of Goodwill

When applying fresh-start reporting, certain accounts, primarily employee benefit and income tax related, were recorded at amounts determined under specific U.S. GAAP rather than fair value and the difference between the U.S. GAAP and fair value amounts gave rise to goodwill, which is a residual. If all identifiable assets and liabilities had been recorded at fair value upon application of fresh-start reporting, no goodwill would have resulted. Goodwill established at fresh-start was $30.5 billion of which

$30.4 billion

has been impaired through December 31, 2013.

In the three months ended December 31, 2013 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1 for all reporting units with Goodwill. Our reporting units are GMNA, GME and various reporting units within the GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial segments. In the year ended December 31, 2013 we also performed event-driven goodwill impairment tests at various dates for certain of our reporting units. Based on our testing procedures we recorded Goodwill impairment charges of

$0.5 billion

in the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily associated with our GM Korea and GM India reporting units. Subsequent to the recording of the Goodwill impairment charges in the year ended December 31, 2013 we had Goodwill of

$1.6 billion

at December 31, 2013 which resulted primarily from the acquisition of AmeriCredit Corp in 2011.

Refer to

Note 10

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill impairments.

For purposes of our 2013 annual impairment testing procedures at October 1, 2013 the estimated fair value of GM Financial’s North American reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 29%. Due to anticipated changes in GM Financial's business model to continue to introduce higher credit quality products into its lending portfolio, the initial equity retention ratio assumption of 12.5% was forecasted to decrease to 7.5% by 2018 in the discounted cash flow analysis utilized for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Having higher credit quality products comprising a larger percentage of GM Financial's lending portfolio will require less equity. GM Korea's fair value continued to be below its carrying amount and GM India’s carrying amount became negative.

The key assumptions utilized in determining the fair value-to-U.S. GAAP differences giving rise to the implied goodwill for the reporting units requiring a Step 2 analysis are: (1) the determination of our nonperformance risk; (2) interest rates; (3) estimates of our employee benefit related obligations; and (4) the estimated timing of the utilization of our deferred tax assets, including our determination whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be utilized. For the year ended December 31, 2013 GM Korea's goodwill assessment was most sensitive to our determination of estimates of our employee benefit related obligations and GM India’s was most sensitive to the estimated timing of the utilization of our deferred tax assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value for the long-lived assets or in certain cases, the asset group to be held and used. Product-specific long-lived asset groups are tested for impairment at the platform or vehicle line level. Non-product-specific long-lived assets are tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis in GMNA and GME and tested at or within our various reporting units within our GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial segments.

In December 2013 we: (1) announced our plans to cease mainstream distribution of Chevrolet brand in Western and Central Europe in 2015 due to the challenging business model and difficult economic situation in Europe; (2) announced plans to cease manufacturing at Holden by the end of 2017; and (3) performed a strategic assessment of GM India in response to lower than



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

expected sales performance of our current product offerings in India, higher raw material costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and recent deterioration in local market conditions. These triggered long-lived asset impairment analyses so we performed recoverability tests on the long-lived assets associated with these asset groups. Our tests concluded that the associated long-lived assets were not recoverable as the resulting undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying amounts. We develop anticipated cash flows from historical experience and internal business plans.

We estimated the fair values of the associated long-lived assets to determine the impairment amount. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. A considerable amount of management judgment was required in determining the fair value of the asset groups which requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, considered to be Level 3 inputs. An in-exchange premise was determined to be the highest and best use of the assets which is different than the assets' current use due to: (1) expected losses to be incurred associated with the exit of Chevrolet from a mainstream presence in Western and Central Europe and the wind down of manufacturing activities at Holden; and (2) the lack of economic support due to declining operations for the existing long-lived assets at GM India. As a result in the three months ended December 31, 2013 we recorded total asset impairment charges of $1.1 billion in GMIO. Refer to Notes


and


to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impairment charges recorded and related fair value measurements.

While we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable, a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material effect to the consolidated financial statements. Long-lived assets could become impaired in the future as a result of declines in profitability due to significant changes in volume, pricing or costs.

Sales Incentives

The estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue, and in certain instances, as an increase to Automotive cost of sales, at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time, including a choice of incentives for a specific model. Incentive programs are generally brand specific, model specific or region specific and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product, product mix, the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions. When an incentive program is announced, the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue or increase to Automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced. If the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid, the reduction in Automotive net sales and revenue or increase to Automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected. There are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives, and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives.

Policy, Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns

The estimated costs related to policy and product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold. Estimated costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. However where little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. We actively study trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims. Actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Automotive

We enter into a variety of foreign currency exchange and commodity forward contracts and options to manage exposures arising from market risks resulting from changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.

The overall financial risk management program is under the responsibility of the Risk Management Committee which reviews and, where appropriate, approves strategies to be pursued to mitigate these risks. The Risk Management Committee comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee assists and guides the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Risk Management Committee. Our risk management policy intends to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures.

The following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, due primarily to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency pairs or offsetting long-short positions in currency pairs which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of the operations. At

December 31, 2013

our most significant foreign currency exposures were the Euro/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Korean Won, Euro/Korean Won and Euro/U.S. Dollar. Derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are used primarily to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. At

December 31, 2013

such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 23 months.

At

December 31, 2013

and


the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was

$1.0 billion

and

$4.0 billion

. This presentation utilizes a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives, embedded derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and excludes the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be

$195 million

and

$671 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.

The following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement losses (dollars in millions):



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Interest Rate Risk

We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments, primarily debt, capital lease obligations and certain marketable securities. At

December 31, 2013

we did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations. At

December 31, 2013

and


the fair value liability of debt and capital leases was

$6.8 billion

and

$5.3 billion

. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would be

$251 million

and

$112 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


.

At

December 31, 2013

and


we had marketable securities of

$7.2 billion

and

$3.8 billion

classified as available-for sale and $1.7 billion and $5.2 billion classified as trading. The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would be insignificant at

December 31, 2013

and


.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's secured and unsecured debt. GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between: (1) interest earned on finance receivables, other income and lease contracts; and (2) interest paid, is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of GM Financial's dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund purchases of finance receivables and leased vehicles.

Credit Facilities

Fixed interest rate receivables purchased by GM Financial are pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility, GM Financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its credit facilities.

Securitizations

In GM Financial's securitization transactions it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trusts that, in turn, sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transactions.

GM Financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of

$3.8 billion

and

$0.8 billion

at

December 31, 2013

and


. GM Financial had interest rate swaps and caps in liability positions with notional amounts of

$5.5 billion

and

$0.8 billion

at

December 31, 2013

and


. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations, primarily those acquired from Ally Financial at various dates in 2013, into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's financial condition.

In connection with the closing of certain acquisitions of Ally Financial's international operations, GM Financial provided loans denominated in foreign currencies (Euro, British Pound and Swedish Krona) to acquired entities that had an equivalent balance of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2013. GM Financial purchased foreign exchange swaps to offset any valuation change in the loans due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of these foreign exchange swaps was insignificant.

The following table summarizes GM Financial's interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, excluding derivatives, by year of expected maturity and the fair value of those assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2013

(dollars in millions):



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

The following table summarizes GM Financial's interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, excluding derivatives, by year of expected maturity and the fair value of those assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2012

(dollars in millions):

GM Financial estimates the realization of finance receivables in future periods using discount rate, prepayment and credit loss assumptions similar to its historical experience. Credit facilities and securitization notes payable amounts have been classified based on expected payoff. Senior notes and convertible senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on maturity.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

General Motors Company, its Directors, and Stockholders:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated

February 6, 2014

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph related to the Company's adoption of a revised accounting standard related to comprehensive income.

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation

General Motors Company was formed in 2009 originally as a Delaware limited liability company, Vehicle Acquisition Holdings LLC, and subsequently converted to a Delaware corporation, NGMCO, Inc. This company, which on July 10, 2009 acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of General Motors Corporation through a Section 363 sale under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (363 Sale) and changed its name to General Motors Company, is sometimes referred to in these consolidated financial statements for the periods on or subsequent to July 10, 2009 as “we,” “our,” “us,” “ourselves,” the “Company,” “General Motors,” or “GM.” General Motors Corporation is sometimes referred to in these consolidated financial statements, for the periods on or before July 9, 2009, as “Old GM” as it is the predecessor entity solely for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Old GM was renamed Motors Liquidation Company (MLC), which was dissolved on December 15, 2011 and transferred its remaining assets and liabilities to the Motors Liquidation Company GUC Trust (GUC Trust).

We design, build and sell cars, trucks and automobile parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). We analyze the results of our business through our

five

segments: GM North America (GMNA), GM Europe (GME), GM International Operations (GMIO), GM South America (GMSA) and GM Financial. Nonsegment operations are classified as Corporate. Corporate includes certain centrally recorded income and costs, such as interest, income taxes and corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries that we control due to ownership of a majority voting interest and our consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We continually evaluate our involvement with VIEs to determine whether we have variable interests and are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. When these criteria are met, we are required to consolidate the VIE. Our share of earnings or losses of nonconsolidated affiliates is included in our consolidated operating results using the equity method of accounting when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. We use the cost method of accounting if we are not able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the affiliate. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to our current year presentation.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.

GM Financial

The amounts presented for GM Financial have been adjusted to include the effect of our tax attributes on GM Financial's deferred tax positions and provision for income taxes since the date of acquisition, which are not applicable to GM Financial on a stand-alone basis, and to eliminate the effect of transactions between GM Financial and the other members of the consolidated group. Accordingly, the amounts presented will differ from those presented by GM Financial on a stand-alone basis.

Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting policies which follow are utilized by our automotive and automotive financing operations, unless otherwise indicated.

Revenue Recognition

Automotive



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

Automotive net sales and revenue are primarily composed of revenue generated from the sale of vehicles. Vehicle sales are recorded when title and all risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customers. For the majority of our automotive sales this occurs when a vehicle is released to the carrier responsible for transporting to a dealer and when collectability is reasonably assured. Vehicle sales are recorded when the vehicle is delivered to the dealer in most remaining cases. Provisions for recurring dealer and customer sales and leasing incentives, consisting of allowances and rebates, are recorded as reductions to Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of vehicle sales. All other incentives, allowances and rebates related to vehicles previously sold are recorded as reductions to Automotive net sales and revenue when announced.

Vehicle sales to daily rental car companies with guaranteed repurchase obligations are accounted for as operating leases. Estimated lease revenue is recorded ratably over the estimated term of the lease based on the difference between net sales proceeds and the guaranteed repurchase amount. The difference between the cost of the vehicle and estimated residual value is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated term of the lease.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

Finance income earned on receivables is recognized using the effective interest method for consumer financing receivables and accrual method for commercial financing receivables. Fees and commissions (including incentive payments) received and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are sold, charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income is generally suspended on accounts that are more than

60 days

delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are recorded to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than

60 days

past due.

Income from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs and incentives, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.

Advertising and Promotion Expenditures

Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred, were

$5.5 billion

Fair Value Measurements

A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

•

Level 1 - Quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets;

•

Level 2 - Quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and

•

Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are

unobservable

.

Financial instruments are transferred in and/or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 at the beginning of the accounting period in which there is a change in the valuation inputs.

Marketable Securities

We classify marketable securities as available-for-sale or trading. Various factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of related income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. We determine realized gains and losses for all securities using the specific identification method.

We measure the fair value of our marketable securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. Securities are classified in Level 1 when quoted prices in an active market for identical securities are available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models and are generally classified in Level 2. These prices represent non-binding quotes. U.S. government and agency securities, sovereign debt and corporate debt securities are classified in Level 2. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmark securities as well as other relevant economic measures. We conduct an annual review of our pricing service. This review includes discussion and analysis of the inputs used by the pricing service to provide prices for the types of securities we hold. These inputs include prices for comparable securities, bid/ask quotes, interest rate yields and prepayment speeds. Based on our review we believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices. Securities are classified in Level 3 in certain cases where there are unobservable inputs to the valuation in the marketplace. Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable inputs, observable components that are validated to external sources.

An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if unrealized losses related to non-trading investments in securities are other-than-temporary. Factors considered in determining whether a loss on a marketable security is other-than-temporary include: (1) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost; (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (3) the intent to sell or likelihood to be forced to sell the security before any anticipated recovery.

Finance Receivables

As the result of our October 2010 acquisition of GM Financial and GM Financial's acquisition of the Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally Financial) international operations, finance receivables are reported in two portfolios: pre-acquisition and post-acquisition portfolios. The pre-acquisition finance receivables portfolio consists of finance receivables that were considered to have had deterioration in credit quality at the time they were acquired with the acquisition of GM Financial or the acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations. The pre-acquisition portfolio will decrease over time with the amortization of the acquired receivables. The post-acquisition finance receivables portfolio consists of finance receivables that were considered to have had no deterioration in credit quality at the time they were acquired with the acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations and finance receivables originated since the acquisitions of GM Financial and the Ally Financial international operations. The post-acquisition portfolio is expected to grow over time as GM Financial originates new receivables.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

Pre-Acquisition Consumer Finance Receivables

At the time of acquisitions the receivables were recorded at fair value. The pre-acquisition finance receivables were acquired at a discount, which contains two components: a non-accretable difference and an accretable yield. The accretable yield is recorded as finance charge income over the life of the acquired receivables.

Any deterioration in the performance of the pre-acquisition finance receivables from their expected performance will result in an incremental provision for loan losses. Improvements in the performance of the pre-acquisition finance receivables will result first in the reversal of any incremental related allowance for loan losses and then in a transfer of the excess from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield, which will be recorded as finance charge income over the remaining life of the receivables.

Post-Acquisition Consumer Finance Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses

Post-acquisition finance receivables originated since the acquisitions of GM Financial and the Ally Financial international operations are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses.

The component of the allowance for consumer finance receivables that are collectively evaluated for impairment is based on a statistical calculation supplemented by management judgment. GM Financial uses a combination of forecasting models to determine the allowance for loan losses. Factors that are considered when estimating the allowance include loss confirmation period, historical delinquency migration to loss, probability of default and loss given default. The loss confirmation period is a key assumption within the models, which represents the average amount of time between when a loss event first occurs to when the receivable is charged-off.

Consumer finance receivables that become classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are separately assessed for impairment. A specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate.

The finance receivables acquired with Ally Financial international operations that were considered to have no deterioration in credit quality at the time of acquisition were recorded at fair value. The purchase discount will accrete to income over the life of the receivables, based on contractual cash flows, using the effective interest method. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts equal to net credit losses for the period. Any subsequent deterioration in the performance of the acquired receivables will result in an incremental provision for loan losses.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market, which represents selling price less cost to sell, considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of current and expected incentive offers at the balance sheet date. Market for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, work in process, supplies and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.

Equipment on Operating Leases, net

Equipment on operating leases, net is reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation, net of origination fees or costs, and lease incentives. Estimated income from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. Leased vehicles are depreciated on a straight-line basis to an estimated residual value over the term of the lease agreements.

We have significant investments in vehicles in operating lease portfolios, which are composed of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of up to

60 months

and vehicles leased to rental car companies with lease terms that average

eight months

or less. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of those assets. For impairment purposes the residual values represent estimates of the values of the vehicles leased at the end of the lease contracts and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under the prevailing market conditions. The adequacy of the estimate of the residual value is evaluated over the life of the lease and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. Impairment is determined to exist



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

if the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicles leased. If the carrying amount is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values.

In our Automotive operations when a leased vehicle is returned the asset is reclassified from Equipment on operating leases, net to Inventories at the lower of cost or estimated selling price, less cost to sell. In our Automotive Finance operations when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of cost or estimated selling price, less costs to sell. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.

Impairment charges related to Equipment on operating leases, net are recorded in Automotive cost of sales or GM Financial operating and other expenses.

Valuation of Cost and Equity Method Investments

When events and circumstances warrant, investments accounted for under the cost or equity method of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. In determining if a decline is other-than-temporary, factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment, the near-term and longer-term operating and financial prospects of the affiliate and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery are considered. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income and gain on investments. Impairment charges related to cost method investments are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.

Property, net

Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality of property are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under capital leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate all depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive cost of sales, Automotive selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial operating and other expenses.

Special Tools

Special tools represent product-specific powertrain and non-powertrain related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize all non-powertrain special tools over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated amortization method. We amortize powertrain special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive cost of sales.

Goodwill

Goodwill arises from the application of fresh-start reporting and acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. Goodwill is tested for impairment for all reporting units on an annual basis during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review. When the fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying amount an impairment charge is recorded for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Fair values of reporting units are established using a discounted cash flow method. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples and the quoted market price for our common stock are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method. Our reporting units are GMNA and GME and various reporting units within the GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial segments. Due to the integrated nature of our manufacturing operations and the sharing of assets, other resources and vehicle platforms among brands within GMNA and GME and because financial information by brand or country is not discrete below the operating segment level, GMNA and GME do not contain reporting units below the operating segment level. GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial are



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

less integrated given the lack of regional trade pacts and other unique geographical differences and thus contain separate reporting units below the operating segment level. Goodwill would be reassigned on a relative-fair-value basis to a portion of a reporting unit to be disposed of or upon the reorganization of the composition of one or more of our reporting units, unless the reporting unit was never integrated.

Intangible Assets, net

Intangible assets, excluding Goodwill, primarily include brand names (including defensive intangibles associated with discontinued brands), technology and intellectual property, customer relationships and dealer networks.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line or an accelerated method of amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data used to measure the fair value of the intangible assets when selecting a useful life. Impairment charges related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive cost of sales.

Amortization of developed technology and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial operating and other expenses.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business are evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific long-lived asset groups are tested for impairment at the platform or vehicle line level and consider their geographical location. Non-product specific long-lived assets are tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis in GMNA and GME and tested at or within our various reporting units within our GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial segments. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are considered held for use until disposition. Product-specific assets may become impaired as a result of declines in profitability due to changes in volume, pricing or costs.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

Attribution, Methods and Assumptions

The cost of benefits provided by defined benefit pension plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of pension plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be: (1) the duration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement specific to the plan; (2) expected future working lifetime; or (3) the life expectancy of the plan participants.

The cost of medical, dental, legal service and life insurance benefits provided through postretirement benefit plans is recorded in the period employees provide service. The cost of postretirement plan amendments that provide for benefits already earned by plan participants is amortized over the expected period of benefit which may be the average period to full eligibility or the average life expectancy of the plan participants, or the period to the plan's termination date for a plan which provides legal services.

An expected return on plan asset methodology is utilized to calculate future pension expense for certain significant funded benefit plans. A market-related value of plan assets methodology is also utilized that averages gains and losses on the plan assets over a period of years to determine future pension expense. The methodology recognizes

60%

of the difference between the fair value of assets and the expected calculated value in the first year and

10%

of that difference over each of the next

four years

.

The discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement-related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates. In the U.S. we use a cash flow matching approach that uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

The benefit obligation for pension plans in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany represents

92%

of the non-U.S. pension benefit obligation at

December 31, 2013

. The discount rates for plans in Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany are determined using a cash flow matching approach, similar to the U.S. approach.

In countries other than the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and those located in the Eurozone discount rates are established depending on the local financial markets, using a high quality yield curve based on local bonds, a yield curve adjusted to reflect local conditions or local actuarial standards.

Plan Asset Valuation

Cash Equivalents and Other Short-Term Investments

Money market funds and other similar short-term investment funds are valued using the net asset value per share (NAV). Prices for short-term debt securities are received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Independent pricing services utilize matrix pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices. Money market mutual funds which provide investors with the ability to redeem their interests on a daily basis and for which NAVs are publicly available are classified in Level 1. Other cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified in Level 2.

Common and Preferred Stock

Common and preferred stock for which market prices are readily available at the measurement date are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively traded and are classified in Level 1. Such equity securities for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of observable inputs, which may include, among others, the use of adjusted market prices last available, bids or last available sales prices and/or other observable inputs and are classified in Level 2. Common and preferred stock classified in Level 3 are those privately issued securities or other issues that are valued via the use of valuation models using significant unobservable inputs that generally consider among others, aged (stale) pricing, earnings multiples, discounted cash flows and/or other qualitative and quantitative factors.

Fixed Income Securities

Fixed income securities are valued based on quotations received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Debt securities which are priced via the use of pricing services that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily observable inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices, are classified in Level 2. Fixed income securities within this category that are typically priced by dealers and pricing services via the use of proprietary pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are classified in Level 3. These inputs primarily consist of yield and credit spread assumptions, discount rates, prepayment curves, default assumptions and recovery rates.

Investment Funds, Private Equity and Debt Investments and Real Estate Investments

Investments in exchange traded funds, real estate investment trusts and mutual funds, for which market quotations are generally readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price, official closing price or publicly available NAV (or its equivalent) on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are classified in Level 1. Investments in private investment funds (including hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate funds) are generally valued based on their respective NAV (or its equivalent), as a practical expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of readily available market prices. Investments in private investment funds, which may be fully redeemed at NAV in the near-term are generally classified in Level 2. Investments in funds, which may not be fully redeemed at NAV in the near-term, are generally classified in Level 3.

Direct investments in private equity, private debt and real estate securities, are generally valued in good faith via the use of the market approach (earnings multiples from comparable companies) or the income approach (discounted cash flow techniques), and consider inputs such as revenue growth and gross margin assumptions, discount rates, discounts for lack of liquidity, market capitalization rates, and the selection of comparable companies. As these valuations incorporate significant unobservable inputs they are classified in Level 3.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

Fair value estimates for private investment funds, private equity, private debt and real estate investments are provided by the respective investment sponsors or investment advisers and are subsequently reviewed and approved by management. In the event management concludes a reported NAV or fair value estimate (collectively, external valuation) does not reflect fair value or is not determined as of the financial reporting measurement date, we will consider whether and when deemed necessary to make an adjustment at the balance sheet date. In determining whether an adjustment to the external valuation is required, we will review material factors that could affect the valuation, such as changes to the composition or performance of the underlying investments or comparable investments, overall market conditions, expected sale prices for private investments which are probable of being sold in the short term and other economic factors that may possibly have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the reported external valuation.

Derivatives

Exchange traded derivatives, such as options and futures, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are classified in Level 1. Over-the-counter derivatives, including but not limited to swaps, swaptions and forwards, which are typically valued through independent pricing services with observable inputs are generally classified in Level 2. Swaps that are cleared by clearinghouses or exchanges are valued with the prices provided by those venues and are generally classified in Level 2. Derivatives classified in Level 3 are typically valued via the use of pricing models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs, but may also include derivatives which are valued with the use of significant observable inputs which are not subject to corroboration. The inputs part of the model based valuations may include extrapolated or model-derived assumptions such as volatilities, yield and credit spread assumptions.

Due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investments in the asset classes described above as well as the inherent uncertainty of valuation, reported fair values may differ from fair values that would have been used had timely available market information been available.

Job Security Programs and Extended Disability Benefits

We have job security programs to provide International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of America (UAW) and Canadian Auto Workers Union (CAW) employees reduced wages and continued coverage under certain employee benefit programs depending on the employee's classification as well as the number of years of service that the employee has accrued. We also provide extended disability benefits for employees currently disabled and those in the active workforce who may become disabled in the form of income replacement, healthcare costs and life insurance premiums.

We recognize a liability for job security programs and extended disability benefits over the expected service period using measurement provisions similar to those used to measure our other postretirement benefits (OPEB) obligations based on our best estimate of the probable liability at the measurement date. We record actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings.

Stock Incentive Plans

We measure and record compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on the award's estimated fair value which is the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, or for restricted stock units (RSUs) granted prior to our public offering, the fair value of our common stock as of the date of the public offering.  We record compensation cost for the awards on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, or for retirement eligible employees over the requisite service period. Salary stock awards granted are fully vested and nonforfeitable upon grant; therefore, compensation cost is recorded on the date of grant. The liability for stock incentive plan awards settled in cash is remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Policy, Product Warranty and Recall Campaigns

The estimated costs related to policy and product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold and are charged to Automotive cost of sales. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors. Trends of claims are actively studied and actions are taken to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims. The estimated costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Income Taxes

The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.

Deferred income tax assets are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. We establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not standard. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors.

It is difficult to conclude a valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We utilize a rolling

three years

of actual and current year results as the primary measure of cumulative losses in recent years.

Income tax expense (benefit) for the year is allocated between continuing operations and other categories of income such as Other comprehensive income (loss). In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in another income category, the tax benefit allocated to continuing operations is determined by taking into account the pre-tax income of other categories.

We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby: (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position; and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than

50%

likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense (benefit).

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that use the local currency as their functional currency are translated to U.S. Dollars based on the current exchange rate prevailing at each balance sheet date and any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose local currency is not their functional currency are remeasured from their local currency to their functional currency and then translated to U.S. Dollars. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. Dollars using the average exchange rates prevailing for each period presented.

Gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of remeasurements discussed in the preceding paragraph are recorded in Automotive cost of sales and GM Financial operating and other expenses unless related to Automotive debt, which are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses were

$350 million

,

$117 million

and

$55 million

in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Recently Adopted Accounting Principles

On January 1, 2013 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income." This ASU does not change current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income (OCI) in financial statements; rather, it requires certain disclosures of the amount of reclassifications of items from OCI to net income by component. The related disclosures are presented in

Note 21

.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In July 2013 the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists” to eliminate diversity in practice. This ASU requires that companies net their unrecognized tax benefits against all same-jurisdiction net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that would be used to settle the position with a tax authority. This new guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

beginning on or after December 15, 2013 and interim periods therein. The adoption of this ASU will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because it aligns with our current presentation.

Acquisition of Businesses

Acquisition of Certain Ally Financial International Operations

In November 2012 GM Financial entered into a definitive agreement with Ally Financial to acquire

100%

of the outstanding equity interests in the top level holding companies of its automotive finance and financial services operations in Europe and Latin America and a separate agreement to acquire Ally Financial’s non-controlling equity interest in GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Company Limited (GMAC-SAIC), which conducts automotive finance and other financial services in China.

On

April 1, 2013

GM Financial completed the acquisition of Ally Financial's European and Latin American automotive finance operations except for France, Portugal and Brazil; on

June 1, 2013

it completed the acquisition of Ally Financial's automotive finance operations in France and Portugal; and on

October 1, 2013

it completed the acquisition of Ally Financial's automotive finance operations in Brazil. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions was

$3.3 billion

, subject to certain closing adjustments. Acquisition-related costs were insignificant. In addition GM Financial repaid loans of

$1.4 billion

that were assumed as part of the acquisitions. GM Financial recorded the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition dates. Certain amounts previously presented related to the acquisitions have been, and will continue to be, updated as a result of closing adjustments.

GM Financial's acquisition of Ally Financial's equity interest in GMAC-SAIC is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals and is expected to close in 2014. GM Financial expects to pay approximately

$900 million

to close this acquisition subject to certain closing adjustments.

The following table summarizes the aggregate consideration and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition dates before eliminations for net intercompany receivables of approximately

$300 million

(dollars in millions):

The fair value of finance receivables was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. The contractual cash flows were adjusted for estimated prepayments, defaults, recoveries and servicing costs and discounted using a discount rate commensurate with risks and maturity inherent in the finance contracts. The contractually required payments receivable, cash flows expected to be collected and fair value for finance receivables acquired with deteriorated credit quality at the acquisition date were

$799 million

,

$728 million

and

$601 million

. The contractually required payments receivable, cash flows not expected to be collected and fair value for other acquired finance receivables were

$15.6 billion

,

$303 million

and

$14.5 billion

. The fair value of secured and unsecured debt was determined using quoted market prices when available and a discounted cash flow approach when not available.

We recorded goodwill in the amount of

$144 million

for the excess of the aggregate consideration over the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and such amount is primarily attributed to the value of the incremental GM Financial business expected. The recorded goodwill is subject to further adjustment resulting from the finalization of closing balance sheet audits. Valuations and assumptions pertaining to income taxes are subject to change as additional information is obtained during the measurement period. All of the goodwill was assigned to the GM Financial segment and will be assigned to reporting units, which will be determined pending completion of the remaining acquisitions. The goodwill is not tax deductible.

GM Financial Receivables, net

In the year ended December 31, 2013 GM Financial acquired certain international operations in Europe and Latin America from Ally Financial that conduct consumer and commercial lending activities. All of the loans acquired were made on a secured basis.

The following table summarizes the components of consumer and commercial finance receivables, net (dollars in millions):

Of the total allowance for loan losses in the above table,

$427 million

and

$266 million

and


.

GM Financial determined the fair value of consumer finance receivables using observable and unobservable inputs within a cash flow model. The inputs reflect assumptions regarding expected prepayments, deferrals, delinquencies, recoveries and charge-offs of the loans within the portfolio. The cash flow model produces an estimated amortization schedule of the finance receivables which is the basis for the calculation of the series of cash flows that derive the fair value of the portfolio. The series of cash flows is calculated and discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) using unobservable debt and equity percentages, an unobservable cost of equity and an observable cost of debt based on companies with a similar credit rating and maturity profile as the portfolio. Macroeconomic factors could negatively affect the credit performance of the portfolio and therefore could potentially affect the assumptions used in GM Financial's cash flow model. Substantially all commercial finance receivables either have variable interest rates and maturities of one year or less, or were acquired or originated within the past year. Therefore, the carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Credit Quality

Consumer Finance Receivables

GM Financial uses proprietary scoring systems that measure the credit quality of the receivables using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores (e.g. FICO score) and contract characteristics. In addition to GM Financial's proprietary scoring systems GM Financial considers other individual consumer factors such as employment history, financial stability and capacity to pay. Subsequent to origination GM Financial reviews the credit quality of retail receivables based on customer payment activity. At the time of loan origination substantially all of GM Financial's international consumers have prime credit scores. In North America sub-prime is typically defined as a loan with a borrower that has a FICO score of less than


. At

December 31, 2013

and 2012

88%

and

84%

of the consumer finance receivables in North America were consumers with FICO scores less than 620.

An account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date such payment was contractually due. At

December 31, 2013

and


the accrual of finance charge income has been suspended on delinquent consumer finance receivables based on contractual amounts due of

$642 million

and

$503 million

.

GM Financial purchases consumer finance contracts from automobile dealers without recourse and, accordingly, the dealer has no liability to GM Financial if the consumer defaults on the contract. Finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and GM Financial has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract.

$152 million

in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.

At December 31, 2012 we measured the fair value of our investment in PSA common stock using the published stock price and determined the carrying amount of our investment in PSA common stock exceeded its fair value. PSA’s stock price had shown no sustained signs of recovery towards the price at which we acquired it in March 2012. Based upon the

55%

decline in PSA common stock price since our acquisition and the nine month duration of the impairment, combined with our fourth quarter reassessment of our European automotive operations, we concluded that the impairment of our investment in PSA common stock was other-than-temporary. As a result we transferred the total unrealized losses from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Interest income and other non-operating income, net resulting in an impairment charge of

GM India

In the three months ended December 31, 2013 we performed a strategic assessment of GM India in response to lower than expected sales performance of our current product offerings in India, higher raw material costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and recent deterioration in local market conditions. Our strategic review indicated that the existing long-lived assets of the GM India asset group were not recoverable. In the three months ended December 31, 2013 we recorded asset impairment charges of

$280 million

to adjust the carrying amount of GM India’s real and personal property to fair value of

$45 million

. These charges were recorded in our GMIO segment in Automotive cost of sales. Our recoverability test of the GM India asset group also included Intangible assets, net and Goodwill resulting in additional impairment charges of

for additional information on the actions taken at Holden.

Year Ended December 31, 2012

During the second half of 2011 and continuing into 2012 the European automotive industry was severely affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, high unemployment and a lack of consumer confidence coupled with overcapacity and we began to experience deterioration in cash flows. In response we formulated a plan to implement various actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness. During the fourth quarter of 2012 our industry outlook deteriorated further and our forecast of 2013 cash flows declined notwithstanding our actions. As a result we performed a recoverability test of the GME asset group by weighting various undiscounted cash flow scenarios and concluded the GME asset group was not recoverable. Accordingly we recorded asset impairment charges of

$3.7 billion

at December 31, 2012 to adjust the carrying amount of the GME real and personal property to fair value of

$0.4 billion

. These charges were recorded in our GME segment with

$3.5 billion

Fair Value Measurements



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

To determine the estimated fair value of real and personal property, the cost approach, market approach and income approach were considered. Under the cost approach, the determination of fair value considered the estimates of the cost to construct or purchase a new asset of equal utility at current prices with adjustments in value for physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence. Under the market approach, the determination of fair value considered the market prices in transactions for similar assets and certain direct market values based on quoted prices from brokers and secondary market participants for similar assets. Under the income approach, the determination of fair value considered the estimate of the present worth of future benefits derived from ownership, usually measured through the capitalization of a specific level of income which can be derived from the subject asset with adjustments in value for demolition costs and for the effect of an estimated holding period. Under the income approach, it was assumed fair value could not exceed the present value of the net cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the level of risk inherent in the subject asset. An in-exchange premise was determined to be the highest and best use.

The following table summarizes the significant Level 3 inputs for real and personal property measurements:

__________

(a)

Represents estimated loss in asset value caused by factors external to the asset such as legislative enactments, changes in use, social change and change in supply and demand.

(b)

Represents estimated marketing period for each property which dictates the amount of property specific holding costs to be incurred such as real estate taxes.

(c)

Represents the discount rate for the specific property based on local market sources and available benchmarking data.

(d)

Represents estimated gross cost to demolish and clear the structures on the property as a percentage of replacement cost new.

(e)

Represents estimated loss in asset value due to wear and tear, action of the elements and other physical factors that reduce the life and serviceability of the asset.

(f)

Represents estimated loss in asset value caused by inefficiencies and inadequacies of the asset itself.

The personal property in our Holden asset group was determined to have a nominal fair value because of anticipated losses during the wind-down period and limited to no salvage value given the decline in the automotive manufacturing base in Australia.

The fair value estimates for GM India, Holden and GME real and personal property are based on a valuation premise that assumes the assets' highest and best use are different than their current use based on the forecasted financial results of the asset groups.

Subsequent to our 2012 annual goodwill impairment testing, we reversed

$36.2 billion

The reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowances resulted in the carrying amount of our GMNA reporting unit exceeding its fair value. As a result we performed an event-driven goodwill impairment test in the three months ended December 31, 2012 and recorded a Goodwill impairment charge of

$26.4 billion

We adopted the provisions of ASU 2010-28, “When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts” (ASU 2010-28) on January 1, 2011 and performed Step 2 of the goodwill impairment testing analysis for our GME reporting unit which had a negative carrying amount resulting in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning Retained earnings. GME continued to have a negative carrying amount and because it was more likely than not further goodwill impairment existed due to further deterioration in the business outlook for GME and increases in the fair value of estimated employee benefit obligations, we recorded Goodwill impairment charges of

$590 million

$1.0 billion

$541 million

$156 million

and

$270 million

in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 within our GMIO segment. The impairment charges primarily related to our GM Korea Company (GM Korea) and Holden reporting units. We performed event-driven goodwill impairment tests for GM Korea in 2013, 2012 and 2011 as the fair value of GM Korea continued to be below its carrying amount due to ongoing economic weakness in certain markets to which GM Korea exports coupled with lower forecasted margins resulting from higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, in the three months ended December 31, 2013 we announced our plans to cease mainstream distribution of Chevrolet brand in Western and Central Europe that resulted in the impairment of the remaining goodwill. Chevrolet sales in Europe are included in our GM Korea

operations. We also recorded a Goodwill impairment charge in the three months ended December 31, 2013 associated with our GM India reporting unit resulting from lower forecasted profitability in India due to lower than expected sales performance of our current product offerings in India, higher raw material costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and recent deterioration in local market conditions. Refer to

Note 9

for additional information on our operations in India. In the three months ended December 31, 2011 we reversed a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for our Holden reporting unit that resulted in the carrying amount of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value. At December 31, 2013 the goodwill balance was

$0

for all of the reporting units in GMIO.

Impairment Charges

The impairment charges recorded as a result of the initial adoption of ASU 2010-28 and the annual and event-driven goodwill impairment tests in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 represent the net decreases in implied goodwill resulting primarily from decreases in the fair value-to-U.S. GAAP differences attributable to those assets and liabilities that gave rise to goodwill upon our application of fresh-start reporting. The net decreases resulted primarily from the reversal of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances for certain reporting units thus resulting in the recorded amount for deferred taxes exceeding their fair values which under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, "Business Combinations" (ASC 805) results in less implied goodwill. The net decreases also resulted from improvements in our nonperformance risk and in our incremental borrowing rates since July 10, 2009. At certain of the testing dates the net decrease was also due to an increase in the high quality corporate bond rates utilized to measure our employee benefit obligations and a decrease in credit spreads between high quality corporate bond rates and market interest rates for companies with similar nonperformance risk. For the purpose of deriving an implied goodwill balance, deterioration in the business outlook and anticipated restructuring activities for GME and GM Korea resulted in a reduction in the fair value of certain tax attributes and an increase in estimated employee benefit obligations. The amount of implied goodwill derived from GM India decreased primarily from a reduction in the fair value of certain tax attributes.

Fair Value Measurements

When performing our goodwill impairment testing, the fair values of our reporting units were determined based on valuation techniques using the best available information, primarily discounted cash flow projections. We make significant assumptions and estimates, which utilized Level 3 measures, about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable inputs into our valuation methodologies. Our fair value estimates for annual and event-driven impairment tests assume the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value.

The valuation methodologies utilized to perform our goodwill impairment testing were consistent with those used in our application of fresh-start reporting on July 10, 2009 and in any subsequent annual or event-driven goodwill impairment tests and utilized Level 3 measures. Because the fair value of goodwill can be measured only as a residual amount and cannot be determined directly we calculated the implied goodwill for those reporting units failing Step 1 in the same manner that goodwill is recognized in a business combination pursuant to ASC 805.

To determine the estimated fair value of the brand intangible assets we used the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this approach revenue associated with the brand is projected over the expected remaining useful life of the asset. A royalty rate is then applied to estimate the royalty savings. The royalty rate used was based on an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible assets and a profit split analysis to determine a rate that is economically supported by GME's forecasted profitability. The net after-tax royalty savings are calculated for each year during the remaining economic life of the asset and discounted to present value.

To determine the estimated fair value of the dealer network we used the cost approach with adjustments in value for the overcapacity of dealers and the sales environment in the region. We determined the fair value to be

$0

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs is backed by the cash flows related to finance receivables and leasing related assets transferred by GM Financial to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial holds variable interests in the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because (1) the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give it the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and (2) the variable interests in the VIEs give it the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets and liabilities of the VIEs are included in GM Financial's consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are stated prior to intercompany eliminations.

Except for the acquisition accounting adjustments, which are not recorded in SPE trusts, GM Financial recognizes finance charge income, leased vehicle income and other income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the secured debt issued by the SPEs. GM Financial also maintains an allowance for credit losses on the Securitized Assets. Cash pledged to support the secured borrowings is deposited to a restricted cash account which is invested in highly liquid securities with original maturities of


days or less.

The assets of the VIEs and the restricted cash held by GM Financial serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required and does not currently intend to provide additional financial support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements, these subsidiaries are separate legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors.

Nonconsolidated VIEs

Automotive

VIEs that are not consolidated include certain vehicle assembling, manufacturing and selling venture arrangements and other automotive related entities to which we provided financial support, including GM India prior to September 2012 and Ally Financial.

We concluded these entities are VIEs because they do not have sufficient equity at risk or may require additional subordinated financial support. We currently lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct those activities of these entities that most significantly affect their economic performance. Our variable interests in these nonconsolidated VIEs include accounts and notes receivable, equity in net assets, guarantees and financial support, some of which were provided to certain current or previously divested suppliers in order to ensure that supply needs for production were not disrupted due to a supplier's liquidity concerns or possible shutdowns.

At

December 31, 2013

and


our variable interests in these VIEs included: (1) Total assets of

$169 million

and

$351 million

, which were composed of Accounts and notes receivable, net and Equity in net assets of nonconsolidated affiliates; (2) Total liabilities of

$838 million

and

$1.9 billion

, which were composed of Accounts payable (principally trade), Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt, Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred income taxes; and (3) Total off-balance sheet arrangements of

$115 million

and

$32 million

, which were composed of loan commitments and other liquidity arrangements. The amount of total off-balance sheet arrangements at

December 31, 2013

includes contractual commitments under an agreement with a supplier that became a VIE in January 2013. The maximum exposure to loss for total assets approximated the carrying amount at

December 31, 2013

Ally Financial Common Stock

At December 31,


we held a

9.9%

common equity ownership in Ally Financial with carrying amount and fair value of

$399 million

and

$1.3 billion

. We estimated the fair value of Ally Financial common stock using a market approach that applied the average price to tangible book value multiples of comparable companies to the consolidated Ally Financial tangible book value. The significant inputs used in our fair value analyses included Ally Financial's financial statements, financial statements and price to tangible book value multiples of comparable companies in the banking and finance industry and the effects of certain Ally Financial shareholder rights. The inputs used in the measurement of the fair value are Level 3 inputs. In December 2013 we sold our investment through a private offering for net proceeds of

$880 million

and recorded a gain of

$483 million

in Interest income and other non-operating income, net.

(c)

Includes coupon rates on debt denominated in various foreign currencies and interest free loans.

The Level 2 fair value measurements utilize quoted market prices and if unavailable, a discounted cash flow model. The valuation is reviewed internally by personnel with appropriate expertise in valuation methodologies. This model utilizes observable inputs such as contractual repayment terms and benchmark yield curves, plus a spread that is intended to represent our nonperformance risk for secured or unsecured obligations. We estimate our nonperformance risk using our corporate credit rating, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes and on our secured revolver, yields on traded bonds of companies with comparable credit ratings and risk profiles. We acquire the benchmark yield curves and nonperformance risk spread from independent sources that are widely used in the financial industry. In certain circumstances we adjust the valuation of debt for additional nonperformance risk or potential prepayment probability scenarios. We may use a probability weighting of prepayment scenarios when the stated rate exceeds market rates and the instrument contains prepayment features. The prepayment scenarios are adjusted to reflect the views of market participants. The fair value measurements subject to additional adjustments for nonperformance risk or prepayment have been categorized in Level 3.

Secured Debt

Wholesale financing represents arrangements, primarily with Ally Financial, where cash is received in advance of the final sale of vehicles, parts and accessories to our dealers or ultimate consumer. These obligations typically settle through the sale and delivery of our products and generally do not require cash outflows to settle. Following GM Financial's acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations in April 2013, most of the wholesale financing balance classified as debt became intercompany debt and was eliminated in consolidation, resulting in a decrease to our automotive debt balance of

$682 million

Secured Revolving Credit Facilities

In November 2012 we entered into

two

new secured revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of

$11.0 billion

. These facilities consist of a

three

-year,

$5.5 billion

facility and a

five

-year,

$5.5 billion

facility and replaced our previous

five

$5.0 billion

secured revolving credit facility. Availability under the secured revolving credit facilities is subject to borrowing base restrictions.

The three-year,

$5.5 billion

facility is available to GM Financial as well as certain wholly-owned domestic and international subsidiaries. The facility includes various sub-limits including a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of

$4.0 billion

, a multi-currency



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

borrowing sub-limit of

$3.5 billion

, a Brazilian Real borrowing sub-limit of approximately

$485 million

and a letter of credit sub-facility limit of

$1.5 billion

. We had amounts in use under the letter of credit sub-facility of

$625 million

at December 31, 2013.

The five-year,

$5.5 billion

facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a letter of credit sub-limit of

$500 million

. This facility is not available to GM Financial.

Our obligations under the secured revolving credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and by a substantial portion of our domestic assets including accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, intellectual property and trademarks, equity interests in certain of our direct domestic subsidiaries as well as up to

65%

of the voting equity interests in certain of our direct foreign subsidiaries, in each case, subject to certain exceptions. The collateral securing the secured revolving credit facilities does not include, among other assets, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as our investments in GM Financial, GM Korea and in our China JVs. If we receive and maintain an investment grade corporate rating from

two

or more of the following credit rating agencies: Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, we will no longer have to post collateral or provide guarantees from certain domestic subsidiaries under the terms of the facilities.

The secured revolving credit facilities contain representations, warranties and covenants customary of these types of facilities, including negative covenants restricting incurring liens, consummating mergers or sales of assets and incurring secured indebtedness, and restricting us from making restricted payments, in each case, subject to exceptions and limitations. These restricted payments include limitations on the amount of dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. These restrictions can be mitigated based on various factors including but not limited to cash flows generated from operating and investing activities, prior restricted payments, our borrowing base coverage ratio, consolidated global liquidity and other provisions. The facilities also require us to maintain at least

$4.0 billion

in consolidated global liquidity and at least

$2.0 billion

in consolidated U.S. liquidity.

Interest rates on obligations under the secured revolving credit facilities are based on prevailing per annum interest rates for Eurodollar loans or an alternative base rate plus an applicable margin, in each case, based upon the credit rating assigned to the secured revolving credit facilities or our corporate rating depending on certain criteria.

Unsecured Debt

Senior Unsecured Notes

In September 2013 we issued

$4.5 billion

. These notes contain terms and covenants customary of these types of securities including limitations on the amount of the secured debt we may issue.

In connection with the issuance of these notes we entered into a registration rights agreement that requires us to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an exchange offer with respect to the senior notes. If the registration statement has not been declared effective by the SEC within


days after the closing date of the debt issuance, if we fail to consummate the exchange offer within


business days after such target effective date or if the registration statement ceases to remain effective, we will be required to pay additional interest of

0.25%

per annum for the first 90 day period following such event and an additional

0.25%

per annum for each subsequent 90 day period prior to the consummation of the exchange offer up to a maximum additional interest rate of

0.5%

per annum.

HCT Notes

As part of the establishment of the HCT to provide retiree healthcare benefits to certain active and retired employees in Canada, we issued notes to the HCT with a fair value of

$1.1 billion

in October 2011. We recorded a premium of

$42 million

at issuance. The notes accrued interest at an annual rate of

7.0%

. The notes were due in periodic installments through 2018. In October 2013 we prepaid the HCT notes in full for

$1.2 billion

. Refer to

Note 15

GM Korea Preferred Shares

Prior to April 2013 GM Korea had outstanding non-convertible mandatorily redeemable preferred shares. Dividends accrued at a rate of

2.5%

through October 2012 and increased to

7.0%

through 2017. In December 2012 GM Korea made a payment of

$671 million

to redeem early a portion of shares that had a carrying amount of

$429 million

to redeem early the remaining balance of the shares that had a carrying amount of

$468 million

and the difference was recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt.

Gains (Losses) on Extinguishment of Debt

In the year ended December 31, 2013 we prepaid and retired debt obligations with a total carrying amount of

$1.8 billion

and recorded a net loss on extinguishment of debt of

$212 million

which primarily represented the unamortized debt discount on the GM Korea mandatorily redeemable preferred shares. In the year ended December 31, 2012 we prepaid and retired debt obligations with a total carrying amount of

$514 million

and recorded a net loss on extinguishment of debt of

$250 million

which primarily represented the unamortized debt discount on the GM Korea mandatorily redeemable preferred shares. In the year ended December 31, 2011 we prepaid and retired in full debt facilities of

$1.0 billion

held by certain of our subsidiaries, primarily in GMNA and GMSA, and recorded a gain on these debt facilities of

$18 million

.

Technical Defaults and Covenant Violations

Several of our loan facilities, including our secured revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary financial statements. Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of default may allow lenders to declare amounts outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements or restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings. A foreign subsidiary was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under its

$77 million

term loan facility. We are evaluating alternatives to cure this financial covenant issue and included this liability in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt.

Automotive Financing - GM Financial

The following table summarizes the carrying amount and fair value of debt (dollars in millions):

_______

(a)

The fair value of debt includes

$23.0 billion

and

$11.1 billion

measured utilizing Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and

$6.2 billion

measured utilizing Level 3 inputs at December 31, 2013. For revolving credit facilities with variable interest rates and maturities of one year or less, the carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of other secured debt and the unsecured debt is based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the market value is estimated by discounting future net cash flows expected to be paid using current risk-adjusted rates.

(b)

Includes a private securitization that GM Financial used observable and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value. Unobservable inputs are related to the structuring of the debt into various classes, which is based on public securitizations issued during the same time frame. Observable inputs are used by obtaining active prices based on the securitization debt issued during the same time frame. These observable inputs are then used to create expected market prices (unobservable inputs), which are then applied to the debt classes in order to estimate fair value which would approximate market value.

Secured

Revolving Credit Facilities



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

The revolving credit facilities have revolving periods ranging from

one

to

three

years. At the end of the revolving period, if the facilities are not renewed, the debt will amortize over periods ranging up to

six

years. Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and it is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged finance receivables and leases. Refer to

Note 12

for additional information relating to GM Financial's involvement with VIEs. Weighted-average interest rates are both fixed and variable, ranging from

0.9%

to

15.9%

GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. Additionally, some of GM Financial’s secured credit facilities contain various covenants requiring minimum financial ratios, asset quality and portfolio performance ratios (portfolio net loss and delinquency ratios and pool level cumulative net loss ratios) as well as limits on deferment levels. Failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurs under these agreements the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements, restrict GM Financial’s ability to obtain additional borrowings under these agreements and/or remove GM Financial as servicer. At

December 31, 2013

GM Financial was in compliance with all covenants related to its credit facilities.

In the year ended December 31, 2013 GM Financial entered into

two

new credit facilities with a total borrowing capacity of

$1.3 billion

. At December 31, 2013 revolving credit facilities of

$7.3 billion

resulted from the acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations.

Securitization Notes Payable

Securitization notes payable represents debt issued by GM Financial through securitization transactions. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the expected term of the securitizations on an effective yield basis. As a result of GM Financial's acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations, GM Financial recorded a purchase accounting discount of

$69 million

that will amortize to interest expense over the expected term of the notes. At December 31, 2013 the remaining purchase accounting discount of

$47 million

is included in Total secured debt.

At the time of securitization of finance receivables, GM Financial is required to pledge assets equal to a specified percentage of the securitization pool to support the securitization transaction. The assets pledged consist of cash deposited to a restricted account and additional receivables delivered to the trust, which create overcollateralization. The securitization transactions require the percentage of assets pledged to support the transaction to increase until a specified level is attained. Excess cash flows generated by the trusts are added to the restricted cash account or used to pay down outstanding debt in the trusts, creating overcollateralization until the targeted percentage level of assets is reached. Once the targeted percentage level of assets is reached and maintained, excess cash flows generated by the trusts are released to GM Financial as distributions from trusts. As the balance of the securitization pool declines, the amount of pledged assets needed to maintain the required percentage level is reduced. Assets in excess of the required percentage are also released to GM Financial as distributions from trusts.

In the year ended December 31, 2013 GM Financial issued securitization notes payable of

$6.8 billion

with a weighted-average interest rate of

1.7%

maturing on various dates through

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. hourly employees (hired prior to October 2007) and Canadian hourly employees generally provide benefits of negotiated, stated amounts for each year of service and supplemental benefits for employees who retire with


years of service before normal retirement age. The benefits provided by the defined benefit pension plans covering eligible U.S. (hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of service and compensation history. Accrual of defined pension benefits ceased on September 30, 2012 for U.S. salaried employees and on December 31, 2012 for Canadian salaried employees. There is also an unfunded nonqualified pension plan covering primarily U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is based on an “excess plan” for service after that date.

Pension Contributions



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

The funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulations or to directly pay benefit payments where appropriate. At

December 31, 2013

all legal funding requirements had been met. We expect to contribute

$100 million

to our U.S. non-qualified plans and

$749 million

to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2014. The following table summarizes contributions made to the defined benefit pension plans (dollars in millions):

We made a voluntary contribution in January 2011 to our U.S. hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans of

61 million

shares of our common stock valued at

$2.2 billion

for funding purposes at the time of contribution. The contributed shares qualified as a plan asset for funding purposes at the time of contribution and as a plan asset valued at

$1.9 billion

for accounting purposes in July 2011. This was a voluntary contribution above our funding requirements for the pension plans.

We continue to pursue various options to fund and derisk our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset portfolio mix to reduce funded status volatility.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Certain hourly and salaried defined benefit plans provide postretirement medical, dental, legal service and life insurance to eligible U.S. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries have postretirement benefit plans, although most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or administered programs.

OPEB Contributions

The following table summarizes contributions to the U.S. OPEB plans (dollars in millions):

For the year ended

December 31, 2011

we also contributed

$1.9 billion

to the independent HCT consisting of restricted cash of

$782 million

and notes payable of

$1.1 billion

.

Defined Contribution Plans

We have a defined contribution plan for eligible U.S. salaried employees. This plan provides discretionary matching contributions which we instituted in October 2009. U.S. hourly employees hired after September 2007 also participate in a defined contribution plan. Contributions are also made to certain non-U.S. defined contribution plans. We made contributions to our defined contribution plans of

$502 million

,

$352 million

and

$297 million

in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Significant Plan Amendments, Benefit Modifications and Related Events

U.S. Salaried Defined Benefit Life Insurance Plan

In September 2013 we amended the U.S. salaried life insurance plan effective January 1, 2014 to eliminate benefits for retirees and eligible employees retiring on or after August 1, 2009. The remeasurement, settlement and curtailment resulted in a decrease in the OPEB liability of

$319 million

, a decrease in the net pre-tax actuarial loss component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$236 million

and a pre-tax gain of

$83 million

.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

U.S. Salaried Defined Benefit Pension Plan

In 2012 we amended the salaried pension plan to cease the accrual of additional benefits effective September 30, 2012 resulting in a curtailment of

$309 million

which decreased the pension liability. We divided the plan to create a new legally separate defined benefit plan primarily for active and terminated vested participants. Settlement payments of

$30.6 billion

were made consisting of lump-sum pension distributions of

$3.6 billion

to retired salaried plan participants, group annuity contracts purchased for a total annuity premium of

$25.1 billion

and two separate previously guaranteed obligations of

$1.9 billion

were settled. These agreements unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee the full payment of all annuity payments to the participants that were receiving payments from the plan and the insurance companies assumed all investment risk associated with the assets that were delivered as the annuity contract premiums.

Through these transactions we have settled certain pension obligations in their entirety resulting in a pre-tax settlement loss of

$2.6 billion

(

$2.2 billion

after tax) in Automotive cost of sales. The pre-tax loss is composed of existing losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$377 million

, and the premium paid to the insurance company of

$2.1 billion

. The tax benefit of

$413 million

is composed of the statutory tax benefit of

$1.0 billion

offset by tax expense of

$596 million

primarily associated with the removal of prior period income tax allocations between Accumulated other comprehensive loss and Income tax expense (benefit).

In 2012 we provided short-term, interest-free, unsecured loans of

$2.2 billion

to provide the plan with incremental liquidity to pay ongoing benefits and administrative costs. Contributions of

$1.7 billion

were made from the

$2.2 billion

loans. Through December 31, 2012

$430 million

was repaid and

$90 million

of the loan was still outstanding. In the year ended December 31, 2013

$60 million

was repaid and the remaining

$30 million

was deemed a plan contribution.

Active salaried plan participants began receiving additional contributions in the defined contribution plan in October 2012.  Lump-sum pension distributions in 2013 of

$430 million

resulted in a pre-tax settlement gain of

$128 million

.

Canadian Salaried Defined Benefit Plans

In June 2012 we amended the Canadian salaried pension plan to cease the accrual of additional benefits effective December 31, 2012 and provide active employees a lump-sum distribution option at retirement. The remeasurement, amendments and offsetting curtailment increased the pension liability by

$84 million

. Active plan participants started receiving additional contributions in the defined contribution plan starting in January 2013.

We also amended the Canadian salaried retiree healthcare plan to eliminate post-65 healthcare benefits for employees retiring on or after July 1, 2014. In conjunction with this change we amended the plan to offer either a monthly monetary payment or an annual lump-sum cash payment to a defined contribution plan for health care in lieu of the benefit coverage provisions formerly provided under the healthcare plan. These amendments decreased the OPEB liability by

$28 million

.

Canadian HCT

In October 2011 pursuant to a June 2009 agreement between General Motors of Canada Limited (GMCL) and the CAW an independent HCT was implemented to provide retiree healthcare benefits to certain active and retired employees. Concurrent with the implementation of the HCT, GMCL was legally released from all obligations associated with the cost of providing retiree healthcare benefits to CAW retirees and surviving spouses by the class action process and to CAW active employees as of June 8, 2009. We accounted for the related termination of CAW hourly retiree healthcare benefits as a settlement and recorded a gain of

$749 million

in Automotive cost of sales. The settlement gain represents the difference between the healthcare plan obligation of

$3.1 billion

(as of the implementation date) and the fair value of the notes and restricted cash contributed totaling

$1.9 billion

, and recognition of Accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$414 million

.

Other Remeasurements

In March 2012 certain pension plans in GME were remeasured as part of our goodwill impairment testing, resulting in an increase of

$150 million

in the pension liability and a pre-tax increase in the net actuarial loss component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

In September 2011 a plan which provided legal services to U.S. hourly employees and retirees was remeasured as a result of our labor agreement provisions which terminated the plan effective December 31, 2013. The negotiated termination has been accounted for as a negative plan amendment resulting in a decrease in the OPEB liability and a pre-tax increase of

$266 million

in the prior service credit component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss was amortized through December 31, 2013.

In March 2011 certain pension plans in GME were remeasured as part of our goodwill impairment testing, resulting in a decrease of

Investment Strategies and Long-Term Rate of Return

Detailed periodic studies conducted by outside actuaries and an internal asset management group are used to determine the long-term strategic mix among asset classes, risk mitigation strategies, and the expected long-term return on asset assumptions for the U.S. pension plans. The U.S. study includes a review of alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance and risk of the individual asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the significant non-U.S. pension plans with the assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical returns, the expected long-term return on plan asset assumptions are determined based on long-term, prospective rates of return.

The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each plan. Individual plans have distinct liabilities, liquidity needs, and regulatory requirements. Consequently, there are different investment policies set by individual plan fiduciaries. Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may differ among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context of the specific factors affecting each plan.

In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected mixes will effectively fund the projected pension plan liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' fiduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S. defined benefit pension plans are increasingly designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions (market value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities) and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded status.

Derivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing exposure to various asset classes and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate and currency risks. Equity and fixed income managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efficient substitutes for traditional physical securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy. Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure.

In December 2013 an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. The study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the U.S. pension plans with resulting changes to the expected long-term rate of return on assets. The weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets increased from

5.8%

at December 31, 2012 to

6.5%

at December 31, 2013 due primarily to higher yields on fixed income securities. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.

Target Allocation Percentages

The following table summarizes the target allocations by asset category for U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans:

__________

(a)

Primarily includes private equity, real estate and absolute return strategies which mainly consist of hedge funds.

Investment Fund Strategies

Equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in developed and/or emerging markets countries.

Fixed income funds include investments in high quality and high yield funds as well as in credit arbitrage funds. High quality fixed income funds invest in government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, mortgages and asset-backed securities. High yield fixed income funds invest in high yield fixed income securities issued by corporations which are rated below investment grade, are unrated but are believed by the investment manager to have similar risk characteristics or are rated investment grade or higher but are priced at yields comparable to securities rated below investment grade and believed to have similar risk characteristics. Credit arbitrage funds invest in a variety of credit and credit-related instruments that allow fund managers to profit from mispricing of these credit instruments. Certain derivatives may be used for hedging purposes by some fixed income fund managers to limit exposure to various risk factors.

Funds of hedge funds represent funds that invest in a portfolio of hedge funds. Fund managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array of funds and/or investment managers.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

Other investment funds primarily represent multi-strategy funds. These funds invest in broadly diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and derivative instruments. Certain funds may also employ multiple alternative investment strategies, in combination, such as global macro, event-driven (which seeks to profit from opportunities created by significant transactional events such as spin-offs, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcy reorganizations, recapitalizations and share buybacks) and relative value (which seeks to take advantage of pricing discrepancies between instruments including equities, debt, options and futures).

Private equity and debt investments principally consists of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide exposure to and benefit from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and distressed debt strategies.

Real estate investments include funds that invest in entities which are principally engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development, financing, sale and/or management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential. These funds typically seek long-term growth of capital and current income that is above average relative to public equity funds.

Significant Concentrations of Risk

The assets of the pension plans include certain private investment funds, private equity and debt securities, real estate investments and derivative instruments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to specific events such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty.

Illiquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension obligations and are not used to fund benefit payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing basis and has procedures in place that are designed to maintain flexibility in addressing plan-specific, broader industry and market liquidity events.

The pension plans may invest in financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the foreign currency exchange rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk.

The pension plans may invest in fixed income securities for which any change in the relevant interest rates for particular securities might result in an investment manager being unable to secure similar returns upon the maturity or the sale of securities. In addition, changes to prevailing interest rates or changes in expectations of future interest rates might result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the securities held. Interest rate swaps and other financial derivative instruments may be used to manage interest rate risk.

Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will default on its commitment. Counterparty risk is primarily related to over-the-counter derivative instruments used to manage risk exposures related to interest rates on long-term debt securities and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The risk of default can be influenced by various factors including macro-economic conditions, market liquidity, fiscal and monetary policies and counterparty-specific characteristics and activities. Certain agreements with counterparties employ set-off, collateral support arrangements and other risk mitigating procedures designed to reduce the net exposure to credit risk in the event of counterparty default. Credit policies and processes are in place to manage concentrations of counterparty risk by seeking to undertake transactions with large well-capitalized counterparties and by monitoring the creditworthiness of these counterparties. The majority of derivatives held by the plans at

December 31, 2013

were fully collateralized and therefore, the related counterparty credit risk was significantly reduced.

Pension Funding Requirements

We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal rules and regulations, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pensions for our retired employees and their spouses. In 2012 the U.S. government enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates. As a result, under current economic conditions, we expect

no

mandatory contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plans for at least

five

years. The new law does not impact our reported funded status. We have

no

funding requirements for our U.S. qualified plans in

Derivative Financial Instruments

Automotive

At December 31, 2013 and 2012 our derivative instruments consisted primarily of options and forward contracts, none of which were designated as hedging relationships. We had derivative instruments in asset positions with notional amounts of

$9.3 billion

and

$9.1 billion

and liability positions with notional amounts of

$427 million

and

$1.6 billion

at December 31, 2013 and 2012. The fair value of these derivative instruments was insignificant.

Guarantees

We provide payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties, such as dealers or rental car companies. These guarantees either expire in 2018 or are ongoing. We determined the fair value ascribed to the guarantees at inception and subsequent to inception to be insignificant based on the credit worthiness of the third parties.

We have agreements with third parties that guarantee the fulfillment of certain suppliers' commitments and other obligations. These guarantees expire in 2014 through 2016 or are ongoing, or upon the occurrence of specific events.

In some instances certain assets of the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the cost of the guarantee. The offset of certain of our payables to guaranteed parties may also offset certain guarantees, if triggered. If vehicles are required to be repurchased under vehicle repurchase obligations, the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to another dealer.

In connection with certain divestitures of assets or operating businesses, we have entered into agreements indemnifying certain buyers and other parties with respect to environmental conditions and other closure costs pertaining to real property we owned. We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these obligations. Immaterial amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant.

In addition to the guarantees and indemnifying agreements previously discussed, we indemnify dealers for certain product liability related claims as subsequently discussed.

With respect to other product-related claims involving products manufactured by certain joint ventures, we believe that costs incurred are adequately covered by recorded accruals. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2020 to 2027.

Other Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters

Various legal actions, governmental investigations, claims and proceedings are pending against us including matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions and fuel economy; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; tax-related matters not recorded pursuant to ASC 740, "Income Taxes" (indirect tax-related matters) and environmental matters.

With regard to the litigation matters discussed in the previous paragraph, reserves have been established for matters in which we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the majority of which are associated with indirect tax-related matters as well as non-U.S. labor-related matters. Indirect tax-related matters are being litigated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales, property taxes and other non-income tax related tax exposures. The various non-U.S. labor-related matters include claims from current and former employees related to alleged unpaid wage, benefit, severance and other compensation matters. Certain South American administrative proceedings are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

funds in escrow. Escrow deposits may range from

$500 million

to

$800 million

. Some of the matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at

December 31, 2013

. We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for such matters based on information currently available. Reserves for litigation losses are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred income taxes. Litigation is inherently unpredictable however; and unfavorable resolutions could occur. Accordingly it is possible that an adverse outcome from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in any particular reporting period.

GM Korea Wage Litigation

Commencing on or about September 29, 2010 current and former hourly employees of GM Korea filed

eight

separate group actions in the Incheon District Court in Incheon, Korea. The cases, which in aggregate involve more than

10,000

employees, allege that GM Korea failed to include bonuses and certain allowances in its calculation of Ordinary Wages due under the Presidential Decree of the Korean Labor Standards Act. In November 2012 the Seoul High Court (an intermediate level appellate court) issued a decision affirming a decision of the Incheon District Court in a case involving five GM Korea employees which was contrary to GM Korea's position in all of these cases. GM Korea appealed to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea (Supreme Court) and initiated a constitutional challenge to the adverse interpretation of the relevant statute. At September 30, 2013 we had an accrual of

843 billion

South Korean Won (equivalent to

$784 million

) in connection with these cases. In December 2013, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in a case involving another company not affiliated with us which addressed many of the issues presented in the cases pending against GM Korea and resolved many of them in a manner which we believe is favorable to GM Korea. In particular, while the Supreme Court held that fixed bonuses should be included in the calculation of Ordinary Wages, it also held that claims for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstances. We believe the Supreme Court’s reasoning is applicable to GM Korea, even though GM Korea’s case remains pending before the Supreme Court. Accordingly, we have eliminated the accrual associated with these cases. In the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded a net reduction of our accrual of

746 billion

South Korean Won (equivalent to

$711 million

) to Automotive cost of sales (

77%

of which is reflected in our Net income attributable to stockholders based on our ownership interest in GM Korea). We estimate our reasonably possible loss, as defined by ASC 450, “Contingencies,” to be

632 billion

South Korean Won (equivalent to

$599 million

) at December 31, 2013. We are also party to litigation with current and former salaried employees over allegations relating to Ordinary Wages regulation. Although the issues differ due to differences between hourly and salaried benefit design, we believe the latest decision of the Supreme Court also impacts this litigation. At December 31, 2013 we have identified a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount of our accrual of

165 billion

South Korean Won (equivalent to

$156 million

). Both the scope of claims asserted and GM Korea's assessment of any or all of the individual claim elements may change if new information becomes available.

GMCL Dealers' Claim

On February 12, 2010 a claim was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against GMCL on behalf of a purported class of over


former GMCL dealers (the Plaintiff Dealers) which had entered into wind-down agreements with GMCL. In May 2009 in the context of the global restructuring of the business and the possibility that GMCL might be required to initiate insolvency proceedings, GMCL offered the Plaintiff Dealers the wind-down agreements to assist with their exit from the GMCL dealer network and to facilitate winding down their operations in an orderly fashion by December 31, 2009 or such other date as GMCL approved but no later than on October 31, 2010. The Plaintiff Dealers allege that the Dealer Sales and Service Agreements were wrongly terminated by GMCL and that GMCL failed to comply with certain disclosure obligations, breached its statutory duty of fair dealing and unlawfully interfered with the Plaintiff Dealers' statutory right to associate in an attempt to coerce the Plaintiff Dealers into accepting the wind-down agreements. The Plaintiff Dealers seek damages and assert that the wind-down agreements are rescindable. The Plaintiff Dealers' initial pleading makes reference to a claim “not exceeding” Canadian Dollar

$750 million

, without explanation of any specific measure of damages. On March 1, 2011 the court approved certification of a class for the purpose of deciding a number of specifically defined issues including: (1) whether GMCL breached its obligation of "good faith" in offering the wind-down agreements; (2) whether GMCL interfered with the Plaintiff Dealers' rights of free association; (3) whether GMCL was obligated to provide a disclosure statement and/or disclose more specific information regarding its restructuring plans in connection with proffering the wind-down agreements; and (4) assuming liability, whether the Plaintiff Dealers can recover damages in the aggregate (as opposed to proving individual damages).  A number of former dealers have opted out of participation in the litigation, leaving


dealers in the certified class. Trial of the class issues is scheduled to occur in the third quarter of 2014. The current prospects for liability are uncertain, but because liability is not deemed probable we have

no

accrual relating to this



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

litigation. We cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in the event of liability as the case presents a variety of different legal theories, none of which GMCL believes are valid.

UAW Claim

On April 6, 2010 the UAW filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan claiming that we breached an obligation to contribute

$450 million

to the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (New VEBA). The UAW alleges that we were contractually required to make this contribution. On December 10, 2013 the court granted our motion for summary judgment and dismissed the claims asserted by the UAW, holding that the relevant agreement is unambiguous and does not require the payment sought. The UAW has appealed. At this juncture, we believe the prospects for liability on the claims asserted in this matter are remote.

Nova Scotia Claims Litigation

We were a participating party-in-interest in proceedings pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to adjudicate claims in the Old GM bankruptcy arising from certain securities issued by General Motors Nova Scotia Finance Company (Nova Scotia Finance), an Old GM subsidiary which we did not acquire in 2009 (Nova Scotia Claims Litigation). Although the proceedings involved

no

claims against us, they presented issues which, depending upon their resolution, could have resulted in future claims against GMCL. In December 2013, pursuant to the agreement, GMCL paid

$50 million

to, or as directed by, the Trustee of Nova Scotia Finance and we (including our subsidiaries and affiliates) were released from all claims relating to Nova Scotia Finance, the Nova Scotia Claims Litigation and the transactions at issue in the litigation.

Product Liability

With respect to product liability claims involving our and Old GM's products, we believe that any judgment against us for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage. Although punitive damages are claimed in some of these lawsuits and such claims are inherently unpredictable, accruals incorporate historic experience with these types of claims. Liabilities have been recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred income taxes for the expected cost of all known product liability claims plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured.

We indemnify dealers for certain product liability related claims including products sold by Old GM. We monitor actual claims experience and make periodic adjustments to our estimates. Based on both management's judgment concerning the projected number and value of both dealer indemnification obligations and product liability claims, we have applied actuarial methodologies and estimated the liability. We expect our product liability reserve to rise in future periods as new claims arise from incidents subsequent to July 9, 2009.

Credit Card Programs

Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles.

Environmental Liability

Automotive operations, like operations of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws, including laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental remediation. Liabilities have been recorded primarily in Other liabilities and deferred income taxes for the expected costs to be paid over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which typically range from

five

to

30 years

.

The final outcome of environmental matters cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Subsequent adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information obtained. In future periods new laws or regulations, advances in remediation technologies and additional information about the ultimate remediation methodology to be used could significantly change our estimates. It is possible that the resolution of one or more environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At

December 31, 2013

we estimate the remediation losses could range from

$120 million

to

$230 million

.

Other Matters

Brazil Excise Tax Incentive

In October 2012 the Brazilian government issued a decree which increased an excise tax rate by


percentage points, but also provided an offsetting tax incentive that requires participating companies to meet certain criteria, such as local investment and fuel efficiency standards. Participating companies that fail to meet the required criteria are subject to clawback provisions and fines. At December 31, 2013 we believe it is reasonably assured that the program requirements will be met based on the current business model and available technologies

.

GME Planned Spending Guarantee

As part of our Opel/Vauxhall restructuring plan agreed to with European labor representatives we have committed to achieving specified milestones associated with planned spending from 2011 to 2014 on certain product programs. If we fail to accomplish the requirements set out under the agreement we will be required to pay certain amounts up to Euro

265 million

for each of those years, and/or interest on those amounts, to our employees. Certain inventory with a carrying amount of

$200 million

and

$186 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


was pledged as collateral under the agreement. Through

December 31, 2013

spending was sufficient to meet the current requirements under the agreement and the specified milestones have been accomplished. Management has the intent and believes it has the ability to meet the future requirements under the agreement.

India Tavera Emissions Compliance

We have identified an emissions compliance issue with the Tavera produced in India. We have self-reported this issue to local government authorities and will cooperate with any review they may conduct. It is too early to determine the impact this issue will have on us or our Indian operations.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Asset retirement obligations relate to legal obligations associated with retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of a long-lived asset. An analysis is performed of such obligations associated with all real property owned or leased, including facilities, warehouses and offices. Estimates of conditional asset retirement obligations relate, in the case of owned properties, to costs estimated to be necessary for the legally required removal or remediation of various regulated materials, primarily asbestos. Asbestos abatement was estimated using site-specific surveys where available and a per square foot estimate where surveys were unavailable. For leased properties such obligations relate to the estimated cost of contractually required property restoration. At

December 31, 2013

and


accruals for asset retirement obligations were

$159 million

and

$116 million

.

that may be carried forward indefinitely at December 31, 2013.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

At December 31, 2013 we retained valuation allowances of

$10.8 billion

against deferred tax assets primarily in GME and South Korea business units with losses and in the U.S. and Canada related primarily to capital loss tax attributes and state operating loss carryforwards.

At December 31, 2012 as a result of sustained profitability in the U.S. and Canada evidenced by three years of earnings and the completion of our near- and medium-term business plans in the three months ended December 31, 2012 that forecast continuing profitability, we determined it was more likely than not future earnings will be sufficient to realize deferred tax assets in these two jurisdictions. Accordingly we reversed most of the U.S. and Canadian valuation allowances resulting in non-cash income tax benefits of

$33.2 billion

and

$3.1 billion

.

At December 31, 2011 as a result of sustained profitability in Australia, we released the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a non-cash income tax benefit of

$502 million

. In Australia we have net operating loss carryforwards which are subject to meeting a "Same Business Test" requirement that we assess on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2013 as a result of our plans to cease vehicle and engine manufacturing at Holden, we determined that it was more likely than not Holden would not realize a portion of the deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of

$133 million

.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The following table summarizes activity of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in millions):

At December 31, 2013 and 2012 there are

$1.5 billion

and

$1.2 billion

of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect our effective tax rate in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 we recorded income tax related interest expense (benefit) and penalties of

$(25) million

,

$44 million

and

$(145) million

. The interest and penalty benefit in the year ended December 31, 2011 was due primarily to remeasurements, settlements and statute expirations. At December 31, 2013 and 2012 we had liabilities of

$286 million

and

$222 million

for income tax related interest and penalties.

In November 2013 we remeasured a previously disclosed uncertain tax position and recorded a

$473 million

tax benefit that increased net operating loss carryforwards, reducing future taxable income.

In the year ended December 31, 2011 certain issues were resolved relating to uncertain tax positions in jurisdictions which had full valuation allowances. The resolution of these matters resulted in a

$2.7 billion

reduction to gross uncertain positions. No tax benefit was recognized with respect to these reductions because the entities were in full valuation allowance jurisdictions or the amounts were reserved in a prior period.

At

December 31, 2013

it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.

Other Matters

Income tax returns are filed in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have open tax years from


to


with various significant tax jurisdictions. These open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or

inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given audit cycle. Given the global nature of our operations there is a risk that transfer pricing disputes may arise.

We have net operating loss carryforwards in Germany through November 30, 2009 that, as a result of reorganizations that took place in 2008 and 2009, were not recorded as deferred tax assets. Depending on the outcome of European court decisions these loss carryforwards may be available to reduce future taxable income in Germany.

In June 2011 we settled a Brazilian income tax matter for

that was reserved and disclosed in a prior period.

In the U.S. we have continuing responsibility for Old GM's open tax years. Old GM was liquidated on December 15, 2011. The Internal Revenue Service has audited the returns through the liquidation date and, in January 2014, the audit of these returns was closed. The reduction to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to be significant. In January 2013 the U.S. Congress enacted federal income tax legislation including an extension of the research credit for tax years 2012 and 2013. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded an income tax benefit related to the 2012 research credit of approximately

$200 million

.

Restructuring and Other Initiatives

We have previously executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we plan to execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary, in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing global automotive production and to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these programs involve voluntary separations, no liabilities are generally recorded until offers to employees are accepted. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive cost of sales and

Automotive selling, general and administrative expense

Stockholders’ Equity and Noncontrolling Interests

Preferred and Common Stock

We have

2.0 billion

shares of preferred stock and

5.0 billion

shares of common stock authorized for issuance. We had

156 million

and

276 million

shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  There were

no

shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2013 and

and

1.4 billion

shares of common stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Preferred Stock

The following table summarizes significant features relating to our preferred stock (dollars in millions, except for per share amounts):

Series A Preferred Stock



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior with respect to liquidation preference and dividend rights to our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of stock that we may issue. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, a holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid, before any distribution or payment may be made to any holders of common stock or other series of stock, the liquidation amount and the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, whether or not declared, prior to such distribution or payment date. On or after

December 31, 2014

, the Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, for cash at a price per share equal to the

$25.00

per share liquidation amount, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Upon a redemption or purchase of any or all Series A Preferred Stock, the difference, if any, between the recorded amount of the Series A Preferred Stock being redeemed or purchased and the consideration paid would be recorded as a charge to Net income attributable to common stockholders.

In September 2013 we purchased

120 million

shares (or

43.5%

of the total shares outstanding) of our Series A Preferred Stock held by the New VEBA at a price equal to

108.1%

of the aggregate liquidation amount for

$3.2 billion

. We recorded a loss for the difference between the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock purchased and the consideration paid, which reduced Net income attributable to common stockholders by

$816 million

. If all of the remaining Series A Preferred Stock were redeemed or purchased at its par value, Net income available to common stockholders would be reduced by a charge of

$800 million

.

Series B Preferred Stock

On

December 1, 2013

each of the

100 million

shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding automatically converted into

1.3736

shares of our common stock for a total of

137 million

common shares. The number of shares of our common stock issued upon mandatory conversion of each share of Series B Preferred Stock was determined based on the average of the closing prices of our common stock over the


consecutive trading day period ended November 26, 2013.

Common Stock

Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. However, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock prohibit, subject to exceptions, the payment of dividends on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are paid in full. Holders of common stock are entitled to

one

vote per share on all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote. The liquidation rights of holders of our common stock are secondary to the payment or provision for payment of all our debts and liabilities and to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, if any such shares are then outstanding.

In December 2012 we purchased

200 million

shares of our common stock from the UST at a price of

$27.50

per share for a total of

$5.5 billion

. The purchase price represented a premium to the prior day's closing price of

$25.49

. We allocated the purchase price between a direct reduction to shareholder's equity of

$5.1 billion

and a charge to Automotive selling, general and administrative expense of

$402 million

representing the premium. These shares were retired and returned to authorized but unissued status. In the year ended December 31, 2012 we issued

1.3 million

shares of common stock for the settlement of restricted stock and salary stock awards and

400,000

shares for exercised warrants. Refer to

Note 23

for additional information on our stock incentive plans.

Warrants

In connection with the 363 Sale we issued

two

tranches of warrants, each to acquire

136 million

shares of common stock, to MLC which have all been distributed to creditors of Old GM and to the GUC Trust by MLC and

one

tranche of warrants to acquire

46 million

shares of common stock to the New VEBA. The first tranche of MLC warrants is exercisable at any time prior to

July 10, 2016

at an exercise price of

$10.00

per share and the second tranche of MLC warrants is exercisable at any time prior to

July 10, 2019

at an exercise price of

$18.33

per share. The New VEBA warrants, which were subsequently sold by the New VEBA, are exercisable at any time prior to

December 31, 2015

at an exercise price of

$42.31

per share. Upon exercise of the warrants, the shares issued will be included in the number of basic shares outstanding used in the computation of earnings per share. The number of shares of common stock underlying each of the warrants and the per share exercise price are subject to adjustment as a result of certain events, including stock splits, reverse stock splits and stock dividends. The outstanding balance of warrants was

293 million

and

313 million

Note 15

for additional information.

Note 22.

Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing Net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding in the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities that are outstanding.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

The following table summarizes basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except for per share amounts):

__________

(a)

Includes earned but undeclared dividends of

$15 million

,

$26 million

and

$26 million

on our Series A Preferred Stock in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and

$20 million

on our Series B Preferred Stock in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock had a right to participate in our undistributed earnings because a dividend, if declared, would result in a transfer of value to the holder through an adjustment to the fixed conversion ratios through various anti-dilution provisions. Based on the nature of the Series B Preferred Stock and the nature of these anti-dilution provisions, we concluded that the Series B Preferred Stock was a participating security and, as such, requires the application of the more dilutive of the two-class or if-converted method to calculate earnings per share when the applicable market value of our common stock is below or above the range of $33.00 to $39.60 per common share. For purposes of calculating earnings per share, the applicable market value is calculated as the average of the closing prices of our common stock over the 40 consecutive trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the date of our mandatory conversion in 2013 or the date of our financial statements for 2012 and 2011. The calculation of the applicable market value is applied to the full year, irrespective of the applicable market value computed during the prior quarters of the current year.

On the mandatory conversion date of our Series B Preferred Stock, December 1, 2013, the applicable market value of our common stock was within the range of $33.00 to $39.60 per common share and, as such, we applied the if-converted method for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share in the year ended December 31, 2013. In the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we were required to use the two-class method for calculating earnings per share as the applicable market value of our common stock was below $33.00 per common share. Under the two-class method for computing earnings per share, undistributed earnings are allocated to common stock and the Series B Preferred Stock according to their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings, as if all the earnings for the period had been distributed. This allocation to the Series B Preferred Stock holders reduced Net income attributable to common stockholders, resulting in a lower basic and dilutive earnings per share amount.



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

The impact on diluted earnings per share was an increase of

$0.13

in the year ended December 31, 2013 using the if-converted as compared to the two-class method. Our calculation of earnings per share varied from period to period depending on whether the two-class or if-converted method was required.

The application of the two-class method resulted in an allocation of undistributed earnings to our Series B Preferred Stock holders and, accordingly,

152 million

common stock equivalents from the assumed conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock are not considered outstanding for purposes of determining the weighted-average common shares outstanding in the computation of diluted earnings per share for December 31, 2012 and 2011.

In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 warrants to purchase

46 million

shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the warrants' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares.

Note 23.

Stock Incentive Plans

Our stock incentive plans consist of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Salary Stock Plan. Both plans are administered by the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.

Retirement eligible participants that are non-Top 100 highest compensated employees who retire in the first twelve months following the grant will retain and vest a pro-rata portion of RSUs earned and those who retire after the first anniversary of the grant will retain and vest the full RSU grant. The vested award will be payable on the settlement date.

The plan was amended in January 2014 to provide cash payment, on a going forward basis, of dividend equivalents upon settlement to active employees and certain former employees with outstanding awards as of the amendment date.

Salary Stock Plan

In the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


a portion of each participant's salary was accrued on each salary payment date and converted to RSUs on a quarterly basis. In March 2012 we amended the plan to provide for cash settlement of awards and reclassified

$97 million

from Additional paid-in capital to Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities and deferred income taxes. Prior to this amendment it was our policy to issue new shares upon settlement of these awards. In June 2013 we amended the plan to provide for cash or share settlement of awards based on election by the participant. The plan was amended in January 2014 to provide cash payment, on a going forward basis, of dividend equivalents upon settlement to active employees with outstanding

Segment Reporting

We analyze the results of our business through our

five

segments: GMNA, GME, GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments through Income (loss) before interest and income taxes, as adjusted for additional amounts, which are presented net of noncontrolling interests, and



GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)

evaluates GM Financial through income before income taxes. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategies. Our automotive manufacturing operations are integrated within the segments, benefit from broad-based trade agreements and are subject to regulatory requirements, such as Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles are needed in our product mix in order to attract customers to dealer showrooms and to maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles. Because of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis.

In the three months ended March 31, 2013 we changed our managerial and financial reporting structure to measure our reportable segments revenue and profitability based on the geographic area in which we sell vehicles to third party customers. We record certain transactions between our automotive and finance segments as intersegment activity and eliminate them in consolidation. The new reporting structure provides clearer profit and revenue visibility across geographic areas and identifies our profitability at the point of sale. Previously, it was based on the geographic area in which the vehicles originated and our managerial and financial reporting structure included intercompany sales and cost of sales in our segment results. Certain expenses such as engineering, warranty, recall campaigns and selling, general and administrative are allocated to the geographic area in which the vehicle is sold to third party customers. We have retrospectively revised the segment presentation for all periods presented.

Substantially all of the cars, trucks and parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America, and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned.

In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, cars and trucks are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Sales to fleet customers are completed through the network of dealers and in some cases sold directly to fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.

GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the following four brands:

•     Buick

•     Cadillac

•     Chevrolet

•     GMC

The demands of customers outside of North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the following brands:

At

December 31, 2013

we also had equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly in entities through various regional subsidiaries, primarily in Asia that design, manufacture and market vehicles under the following brands:

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at

December 31, 2013

, utilizing the criteria discussed in the “Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective at

December 31, 2013

. Based on management's assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at

December 31, 2013

.
