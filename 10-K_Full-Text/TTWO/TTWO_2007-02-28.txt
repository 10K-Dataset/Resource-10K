EXPLANATORY NOTE

In this Form 10-K, Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc. (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or similar pronouns) is
restating its consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash
flows for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and October 31,
2004, as well as consolidated financial information for each of the quarters in
fiscal year 2005.

This Form 10-K also reflects the
restatement of “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in Item 6 as of and for
the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005, 2004, 2003, and 2002, and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Item 7 for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and October 31,
2004.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K,
Form 10-K/A and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected
by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied on.

As the Company previously reported, on June 23,
2006, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), based on the
recommendation of the Company’s management, initiated an investigation of all
of the Company’s stock option grants during the period from its April 15,
1997 initial public offering (“IPO”) through June 2006 and assigned the
investigation to a Special Committee of its Board consisting of three
independent members of the Board (the “Special Committee”). On July 7,
2006, the Special Committee retained independent legal counsel, and such
counsel retained independent accounting advisors (collectively the “Investigative
Team”). The investigation included a broad and extensive document review
(including the Company’s 1997 and 2002 Stock Option Plans, all Compensation
Committee minutes, Board minutes, employment agreements, stock option
agreements, offer letters, emails, accounting records such as earnings per
share schedules, master option tracking schedules and other correspondence and materials
contained in personnel files) and interviews of certain present and former
Company officers, Directors and employees who were involved in or appeared to
have knowledge of the issuance of the grants. During the period from April 15,
1997 through June 2006 the Company issued approximately 1,100 stock option
grants at irregular intervals and for a variety of reasons including employee
hiring, retention and promotion awards, broad-based awards, executive incentive
awards and awards made in connection with business acquisitions. The
Investigative Team found that the Company, in granting options, failed in many
cases to comply with the terms of its Stock Option Plans, did not maintain
adequate control and compliance procedures for option grants, and did not
generate or maintain adequate or appropriate documentation of such grants.

In particular, the Investigative Team concluded that
between April 1997 and August 2003, the former Chairman/CEO of the
Company, who resigned from his last (non-executive) position with the Company
in October 2006, controlled and dominated the stock option granting
process. More specifically, during that period, numerous option grants appear
to have been backdated through a variety of methods. It was determined that the
former Chairman/CEO of the Company was primarily responsible for the selection
of exercise prices and grant dates and the resulting backdating issues and was
assisted by certain past employees and past members of management. The
Investigative Team concluded, among other things, that the conduct of these
individuals raised concerns about the reliability of their representations to
the Company’s independent auditors and as a result the Company has concluded
that such concerns are applicable to representations made by these individuals
to the Company.


Furthermore, available contemporaneous documentation
that was used by the Company to support its stock option grants was found by
the Investigative Team to be unreliable, deficient or nonexistent in many cases.
This documentation primarily took the form of stock option agreements,
interoffice stock grant requests and beginning in May 2002, undated stock
option grant letters, most of which were authorized and signed by the former
Chairman/CEO. The Investigative Team found no evidence that the Company’s
current senior executive management engaged in any misconduct with respect to
the Company’s option granting practices. They also determined that while the
members of the Compensation Committee abdicated their responsibility,  with respect to the granting of stock options,
they did not engage in any willful misconduct or other dishonest acts.

It was determined that due to the backdating practices
and the lack of contemporaneous or reliable documentation, all stock option
grants should be reviewed, analyzed and re-measured based on the most reliable
existing documentation.

The Investigative
Team employed forensic analysis of all available written and electronic
documents, the result of which established a set of documents to analyze stock
option granting activity. Consistent with the accounting literature and recent
guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff, the grants
during the relevant period were organized into categories based on the grant
type. After reviewing all available relevant documentation, a general hierarchy
of documentation was considered when establishing an appropriate measurement
date for accounting purposes. Although the hierarchy was considered, each grant
was evaluated individually based on the particular facts and circumstances in
each case. The documentation considered was:

·

Minutes
of Board of Directors or Compensation Committee meetings (“Minutes”);

·

Date
of hire (if the grant was a new hire grant, evidenced by an employment
agreement or offer letter);

·

Correspondence
or other documentation supporting the option grant (e.g. emails, internal
memos, Forms 4, and other materials contained in personnel files);

·

Earliest
date  as evidenced by (a) updating
of the Company’s master stock option tracking spreadsheets (the Company’s
tracking system which accumulated all stock option grants and all relevant
terms, which was updated with new grants continuously, for which forensic
analysis provided a date on which the option grant was first included in the
Company’s master option spreadsheet) (b) stock option exercise dates or (c) inclusion
in quarterly diluted earnings per share calculation records (the “EPS Records”).

The Company identified certain stock option grants as
having approvals of the allocation of shares to specific individuals and an
exercise price evidenced by dated Minutes, which differed from the measurement
date that was indicated within the Company’s master stock option tracking
spreadsheets. Often, awards had an approval date in the Minutes that was
subsequent to the grant and measurement date reported by the Company within the
Company’s stock option award documentation. Other grants were found to have
been assigned measurement dates subsequent to documented approval in the
minutes which would have indicated a potential re-pricing of the options,
specifically when there was a significant time lag between the approval in the
minutes and the measurement date and the price on the measurement date was
significantly lower. Accordingly, certain of these grants were determined to
have been awarded on the date approved by the Compensation Committee and
re-priced on a subsequent date, particularly for grants that the Investigative
Team believed the recipients would have been knowledgeable of the Compensation
Committee’s approval and the key terms and conditions of the grant. Furthermore,
in certain instances the Minutes acknowledged prior approvals of stock-based
compensation awards although no documentation of such approval exists in the
Company’s records. In each of the cases described above, the Company determined
that the originally assigned measurement dates could not be reliably supported


and such grants should be based on dates documented in
the Minutes. As a result, the Company re-measured and accounted for these
awards as fixed (variable with respect to the options considered to be
re-priced) on the date indicated in the Minutes.

The Company issued stock options in connection with
employment agreements, offer letters, or other documentation indicative of an
employee’s start of employment, but such awards often had measurement dates
prior to the actual commencement of employment. The Company determined the
appropriate measurement date for these grants to be the date on which the
employee commenced employment.

The Company also identified certain stock option
grants where the sole evidence was the aforementioned stock option agreements,
interoffice request forms or stock option grant letters and employment
agreement amendments (collectively, “Non-contemporaneous Dated Documents”).
Stock option agreements included terms of the option grant and typically used “as
of” dating to document such terms, and the Investigative Team concluded that it
was unlikely that such agreements were signed by the Company and the employee
on a contemporaneous basis. The interoffice request forms were undated standard
forms that reflected the term of the option grants including, in some cases,
grant dates. Stock option grant letters were also undated correspondence that
reflected all of the terms of the options. The stock option grant letter became
the primary means of documenting all of the terms of the option grants
beginning in May 2002. At that time, the Company memorialized all prior
option grants by preparing stock option grant letters and these grant letters
were not contemporaneously prepared. All of the Non-contemporaneous Dated
Documents were either authorized or signed by the former Chairman/CEO until March 2004
when he stepped-down as Chairman. As noted above, the Investigative Team found
the former Chairman/CEO to have engaged in a pattern and practice of backdating
option grants and determined that his representations could not be relied upon.
Accordingly, any form of stock grant documentation that was authorized and/or
signed by him and for which there was no other evidence that corroborated that
measurement date, was deemed to be unreliable for measurement purposes.

Employment agreement amendments typically acknowledged
a previous grant of options or a new grant and there was either limited or no
documentation supporting the previous grant. Frequently, the indicated date of
the grant was considered a “fortuitous” date (i.e. a date on which the Company’s
stock price was at a low point during the period). The Investigative Team found
evidence that the indicated grant date within such agreements was often
unreliable for measurement purposes, and in some cases the amendment itself was
backdated.

With respect to the Non-contemporaneous Dated
Documents or otherwise unsupported grants, the Investigative Team reviewed and
analyzed all available correspondence, including the master stock option
tracking spreadsheets to determine the date on which the option was first
entered into the spreadsheet, and the first period the grant was included in
the EPS Records. The Company used available metadata and other computer
generated records to determine the date on which the award was first entered
into these spreadsheets. If the first date that the option was entered into the
spreadsheet was identified, that date was used as the measurement date after
considering any other available documentation. In cases where the date of first
entry in the master option tracking spreadsheet was subsequent to the quarter
in which the grant was first included in the EPS Records, these EPS Records
were used for the determination of the measurement date.

EPS
Records were only considered when there was no earlier correspondence or other
evidence to document a more reliable measurement date.

The Company believes that this evidence, as supported
by the Investigative Team’s conclusions, is consistent with the provisions of
APB 25 whereby the measurement date is the first date on which the number of
shares that each individual is allocated and the related option price is determined
with employee notification soon afterwards (i.e. a “mutual understanding”
between the employee and the Company of the key terms and conditions of an
award)  (See paragraph below regarding
actual date selected). While the number of shares and their corresponding
exercise prices were identified in all of the


Non-contemporaneous Dated Documents or employment agreement
amendments referred to above, the Investigative Team determined that in many
instances these documents were not contemporaneously prepared and, as noted
above, could not be relied upon for the measurement date. Additionally, the
Investigative Team noted that the granting process and related approvals,
whether formally approved by the Compensation Committee or authorized by the
former Chairman/CEO, occurred prior to including the grant and its terms in
master stock option tracking spreadsheets and the EPS Records. Once grants and
their relevant terms were included in these spreadsheets or the EPS Records,
changes to key terms (exercise price, number of shares, vesting period and
identified employee) did not occur.

Where evidence of a stock option grant was limited to
the EPS Records, this evidence does not result in a specific date as required
under APB 25, but rather the period in which the measurement date occurred. Accordingly,
the Company considered the qualitative and quantitative attributes of several
alternatives, including using the date of the Company’s high and median closing
stock price in each quarter. In the absence of evidence to support a more
appropriate measurement date, the Company has selected the first instance of
the highest quoted stock price in the quarter that the stock option grant was
first included in the EPS Records as its measurement date for such stock option
grants. The Company believes that this ensures that a sufficient amount of
compensation expense results and that this date is equally probable to any
other date in the quarter. Furthermore, neither existing documentation nor the
results of the investigation indicate that there is a more appropriate date. This
methodology resulted in the Company recognizing approximately $25 million of
cumulative pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the period April 15,
1997, the date of the Company’s IPO, through October 31, 2005.

If the Company had instead used the median closing
price of its common stock in the corresponding quarters, rather than the
highest price, the Company estimates that it would have reduced its cumulative
pre-tax stock-based compensation charge by approximately $13 million. Restated
cumulative net income (i.e. net income from the date of the Company’s IPO through
October 31, 2005) would have been approximately 3% higher if the Company
had used the median closing price of its common stock, rather than the highest
price. The Company has deemed the difference between recording compensation
expense based on the Company’s high and median closing stock prices to be
quantitatively immaterial in the aggregate and to each individual fiscal year
since the Company’s IPO, except for the Company’s fiscal years ended 2001 and
2000, when such difference would have impacted the Company’s previously
reported net income by approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million,
respectively. However, the Company believes that these differences, in
isolation, are not qualitatively material and would not impact an investor’s
prospective opinion or valuation of the Company.

The Company also reviewed 84 restricted stock awards
that were issued between May 2002 and June 2006 and identified 10
instances in which such awards had measurement dates that did not correspond
with Minutes, employment agreements, offer letters, or other documentation
indicative of an employee’s start date of employment. As a result, the Company
recognized additional cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $0.6
million, net of tax, through October 31, 2005 related to these awards. The
re-measurement of restricted stock awards resulted in $1.0 million of
additional stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, in fiscal 2006,
through the second quarter ended April 30, 2006, and did not have a
material impact on the Company’s previously reported 2006 quarterly financial
statements.

Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the
Company applied the controlling accounting standards in each year to determine,
for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the
measurement date was not the original date that was reported in the records of
the Company, accounting adjustments were made to record compensation expense
based on the difference between the closing price on the revised measurement
and the exercise price. The restatement as a result of the Special Committee
investigation resulted in stock-based compensation expense and tax effects
totaling approximately $54.6 million ($42.1 million, net of tax) from the IPO
through October 31, 2005. The Investigative Team used a


significant amount of judgment in examining each
separate option grant and also in determining the new measurement date applied
to each grant in the Company’s calculation of compensation expense.

The impact of the restatement adjustments on the
Company’s 2006 statements of operations was recorded in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2006 due to its immateriality, and therefore the Company’s
previously reported 2006 first and second quarter results of operations have
not been restated.

The incremental impact
from recognizing stock-based compensation expense resulting from the
investigation of past stock-based compensation awards is shown below (dollars
in thousands).

Additionally, the Company has restated the pro forma
expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123
in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K
to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended October 31,
2005 and October 31, 2004.


The Company is in the process of determining the
extent of the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of
re-measured stock options. The adverse tax consequences are that re-measured
stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 (“409A Affected Options”)
subject the option holder to a penalty tax under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 409A
(and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes). One action being considered by the
Company is to offer to amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the exercise
price to the market price on the accounting measurement date or, if lower, the
market price at the time of the option amendment. The amended options would not
be subject to taxation under IRC Section 409A. Under IRS regulations,
these option amendments had to be completed by December 31, 2006 for
anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409A Affected
Options; the amendments for non-executive officers cannot be offered until
after this Form 10-K is filed and do not need to be completed until December 31,
2007. Another possible action is to approve bonuses payable to holders of the
amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option
exercise price. The amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the
Company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price
is paid (but there is no assurance that the options will be exercised). The
Company has not determined what actions it will take, if any, with respect to
409A Affected Options. Any charges that arise from actions taken by the Company
will be recorded in the period in which the determinations are made.

The Company also believes that United States tax
deductions taken for stock option exercises in prior years, which pertained to
certain executives, may not be deductible under limitations imposed by IRC Section 162(m).
Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above $1 million
to certain executive officers of public companies when such compensation is not
incentive-based. The Special Committee found that many of the stock options
granted to executives had intrinsic value on the basis of the new measurement
dates determined for US GAAP financial statement purposes and therefore, under Section 162(m),
may not be incentive-based and may not be tax deductible by the Company. As a
result the Company has reduced its available tax net operating loss
carry-forwards arising from certain exercised stock options and restricted
stock. Separately, the Company also identified certain restricted stock grants
and bonuses paid in prior periods that may be ineligible for deduction under
section 162(m). The Company restated its tax provisions in the periods in which
the benefits were recorded. The Company is in discussions with the IRS to
settle these uncertainties regarding additional liabilities; however, there is
no assurance that they will be settled on terms favorable to the Company.

As a result of its review, the Company also determined
that it failed to properly withhold an immaterial amount of employment taxes
associated with certain stock option exercises. The Company has recorded such
amounts in its consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the
Company was originally obligated to make the withholding.

properties.

Our Distribution
Business

Through our distribution segment, which primarily
operates in North America and includes our Jack of All Games subsidiary, we
supply retailers with our internally developed products as well as third-party
software, hardware and accessories. We distribute third-party console, handheld
and PC products, consisting principally of newly released and popular software
titles, budget and catalog software titles, hardware and accessories.

Jack of All Games seeks to
capitalize on the growing installed base of hardware and the proliferation of
software titles and outlets to purchase software. It has established a strong
presence in the budget segment of the business due to its expanding portfolio
of value-priced products and its expertise in selling these titles. Jack of All
Games continues to leverage this strategy by serving as the distributor of our
value-priced publishing products.

Fiscal 2006 Product
Launches

We publish products in the action, racing, strategy,
sports and simulation genres. During fiscal 2006, we published 15 new
internally developed titles and 18 new titles developed by third parties. Of
these titles, 3 internally developed titles each sold more than one million
units across all platforms, and 3 internally developed and 2 externally
developed titles each sold more than 500,000 units across all platforms.


In fiscal 2006,

Grand
Theft Auto

products accounted for approximately 22.4% of our net
revenue, with

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City
Stories

for the PSP and PlayStation 2 accounting for 7.5% and 4.5%,
respectively, of our revenue;

Grand Theft
Auto: Vice City Stories

for the PSP accounting for 4.2% of our
revenue; and

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for
the PlayStation 2 accounting for 3.5% of our revenue, respectively. No other

Industry Overview

Expanding gamer
demographics have driven demand for interactive entertainment software in
recent years, with video games becoming a mainstream entertainment choice for a
maturing sophisticated audience. According to the Entertainment Software
Association, more than 228 million computer and video games were sold in the
United States in 2005, representing almost two games for every household in
America. At least half of all Americans claim to play PC and video games, with
an estimated 69% of parents and caregivers playing games. The average game
player is 33 years old and has been playing for nearly 10 years. The
International Development Group reports sales of PC, console and handheld games
(excluding wireless applications) to be $7.9 billion in 2006 in North America
and estimates such sales to reach $8.5 billion in 2007.

The video game industry is
cyclical and the introduction of next-generation hardware platforms has
historically had a significant effect on the demand for gaming software. Demand
for current generation gaming software often diminishes as consumers await the
release of next-generation hardware platforms. Additionally, the introduction
of new hardware platforms has, in many cases, been characterized by delays in
launch dates or reductions in launch quantities or both. Each of these
circumstances had a significant financial impact on us.

Sony introduced its new
PSP handheld gaming system in 2005, which was followed by the release of
Microsoft’s next-generation platform, the Xbox 360, in the first quarter of our
fiscal 2006. Sony introduced its next-generation console, the PlayStation 3, in
North America in November 2006 and is expected to do so in Europe in 2007.
Nintendo also launched its next-generation console, the Wii, in North America
in November 2006, and Europe in December 2006. These next-generation
consoles are more complex than their predecessors, and in some cases contain
multi-processor technology, new and unique game controllers, online gameplay
functionality and high definition video capabilities, which in turn require
video game developers to create games that are progressively more elaborate and
costly to develop.

During the transition to
next-generation hardware platforms, the gaming software industry continues to devote
significant resources to create games for current generation systems. However,
as next-generation platforms gain acceptance, the software industry has
historically been compelled to lower prices on titles developed for older
platforms to compensate for the shift in demand to the newer gaming systems. This
decrease in demand may result in lower than expected sales on products designed
for older platforms.

Transition periods also
mark a shift in the software development process for next-generation gaming
systems. During technology console transition periods, software publishers and
developers often devote significant resources to producing next-generation
software products for new gaming consoles, which have a
limited installed hardware base. As a result, next-generation software
products often start out selling at relatively low unit volumes and the time
required for software publishers to recognize a return on their investment
is increased. See Item 1A. - “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the transition
to next-generation hardware platforms and the impact on our business.

The Entertainment Software
Rating Board (“ESRB”), through its ratings system, requires game publishers to
provide consumers with information relating to video game content, including
graphic violence, profanity or sexually explicit material contained in software
titles. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive
entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit
material by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public
demonstrations and media campaigns, and various governmental bodies have
proposed regulation aimed at our industry to prohibit the sale to minors of
software containing such material. Additionally, retailers may decline to sell
interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually
explicit material that they deem inappropriate for their businesses. Some of
our titles have received an “M” rating (age 17 and over). If retailers decline
to sell our “M” rated products or if our products are rated “AO” (age 18 and
over), we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular
titles, which in the case of our best selling

Grand
Theft Auto

titles could seriously hurt our business. See Item 1A—“Risk
Factors.”


We anticipate an expanding
market for interactive entertainment software as more powerful computing
capabilities, increasingly realistic graphics, backwards compatibility of
software, broadband connectivity, greater online functionality, online
marketplace opportunities and expanded artificial intelligence capabilities of
new platforms create new consumer awareness and demand for this compelling
entertainment medium.

Software Content and Licensing

We have established a
portfolio of successful proprietary software content. We own all of the
intellectual property rights associated with the following brands:

Grand Theft Auto, Midnight Club, Bully, Rockstar Games Presents Table
Tennis,  Sid Meier’s Civilization, Sid
Meier’s Railroads!, Sid Meier’s Pirates, Manhunt, Red Dead Revolver, Max Payne,
Smuggler’s Run, Spec Ops, Bioshock, Top Spin, Amped, Links, Railroad Tycoon and
Xcom.

We believe that content ownership facilitates our internal
product development efforts and maximizes profit potential.

In 2006 we renewed our
licensing relationship with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National
Hockey League Players’ Association (NHLPA). We also entered into an agreement
to publish and distribute a video game based on the Columbia Pictures film

Ghost Rider

on multiple platforms. In 2005 we acquired
rights to other popular entertainment properties and sports licenses, including
long-term, third-party exclusive licensing relationships with Major League
Baseball Properties (MLBP), the Major League Baseball Players Association
(MLBPA) and Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM) and a non-exclusive
long-term licensing relationship with the National Basketball Association
(NBA). Our agreements with licensors grant us intellectual property rights and
require us to make significant license payments.

See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual
Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”

Intellectual Property

We develop proprietary
software titles and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software
titles developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our software and
production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well
as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution.
Although we generally do not hold any patents, we obtain trademark and
copyright registrations for our products.

Interactive entertainment
software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third
parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our titles to obtain and use
programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well
organized piracy operations have proliferated in recent years, resulting in the
ability to download pirated copies of software over the Internet. Although we
attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software, piracy of our
products could negatively impact our future profitability. See Item 1A. - “Risk
Factors.”

As the amount of
interactive entertainment software in the market increases and the
functionality of this software further overlaps, we believe that interactive
entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such
software infringes the copyrights or patents of others. From time to time, we
receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties
alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our
titles and the titles and technologies of third-party developers and publishers
with whom we have contractual relationships do not and will not infringe or
violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of
proprietary rights of others may occur. Any claims of infringement, with or
without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend. See
Item 1A. - “Risk Factors,”


Software Development

Rockstar.

We
develop most of our software titles for our Rockstar label through our internal
development studios: Rockstar North, the developer of

Grand Theft Auto

and

Manhunt

; Rockstar San Diego, the developer
of

Midnight Club,

Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis,

Smuggler’s Run

and

Red
Dead Revolver

; Rockstar Toronto, the developer of

The Warriors

for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, as well as the PlayStation 2 version
of

Max Payne

; Rockstar Vancouver,
the developer of

Bully

; and
Rockstar Leeds, the developer of the PSP versions of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City
Stories; Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition,

and

The Warriors

. Rockstar also announced an arrangement with
Team Bondi Pty Ltd to develop

L.A. Noire

, a
crime thriller for next-generation systems.

2K Games.

While
many of our 2K Games titles are developed by third-party developers, we also
develop software titles for our 2K Games label through our internal development
studios:  Irrational Studios, acquired in
fiscal 2005, the developer of the third-party titles

System Shock 2, SWAT 4

,

Freedom
Force

and the upcoming proprietary title

BioShock;

and Firaxis, the developer of

Sid Meier’s Railroads!, Sid Meier’s Pirates!,

and

Sid Meier’s

Civilization

.

2K Sports.

In
fiscal 2006, 2K Sports continued to expand its internal development studios

.

Visual Concepts Entertainment and Kush
Games, which we acquired in fiscal 2005, continue to develop the majority of
our sports titles, including the

Major
League Baseball 2K

series,

NBA 2K

series,

NHL 2K

series
and

College Hoops 2K

series. PAM
Developments, which was also acquired in fiscal 2005, develops our

Top Spin

tennis

series.

Global Star Software.

While the
majority of our Global Star titles are developed by third-party developers, we
also develop software titles for our Global Star label through our internal
development studio Cat Daddy Games, the developer of

Mall Tycoon 3

and

Deal or No Deal

.

Research and Development.

As
of October 31, 2006, we had a research and development staff of 1,214
employees with the technical capabilities to develop and localize software
titles for all major current and next-generation console and handheld hardware
platforms and the PC in all major territories. Localization involves
translating game text into foreign languages and making other changes
appropriate to territory.

External Product Development.

Certain
of our titles are developed by third parties. Agreements with developers
generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to
make advance royalty payments, pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy
other conditions. Royalty advances for software titles are typically recoupable
against royalties otherwise due to developers.

Our agreements with
developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts
and to cease making advance payments if specified development milestones are
not satisfied. We monitor the level of advances in light of expected sales for
the related titles and write off unrecoverable advances to cost of sales in the
period in which we determine the advance will not be fully recovered. See Item
7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”

The development cycle for
new console, handheld and PC titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 36
months. Although we often simultaneously develop our software for multiple
platforms, in certain cases it can take nine to 12 months to adapt a product
for additional hardware platforms after initial development for one platform is
completed. The cost to develop a frontline software product generally ranges
from $5 million to $20 million. We expect that development costs will continue
to increase for next-generation platforms.

Arrangements with Platform Manufacturers

We have entered into
license agreements with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to develop and publish
software in North America and Europe for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PSP,
Xbox, Xbox 360, Nintendo


GameCube and Game Boy
Advance. We are not required to obtain any licenses to develop titles for the
PC.

Sony.

In May 2000,
we entered into a Licensed Publisher Agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment
America, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, Sony granted us the right
and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the
PlayStation 2 in North America. The agreement requires us to submit products to
Sony for its approval. The agreement provides for Sony to be the exclusive
manufacturer of our products for the PlayStation 2 and for us to pay royalties
to Sony based on the number of units manufactured.

The agreement with Sony is
automatically renewable for successive one-year terms, unless terminated by
Sony in the event of a breach by us or our bankruptcy or insolvency. Sony may
also terminate the agreement on a title-by-title basis. Upon expiration or
termination of this agreement, we have certain rights to sell off existing
inventories. We also entered into a similar agreement with Sony for the
PlayStation 2 covering European territories and Australia.

In September 2004, we
entered into a three-year agreement with Sony pursuant to which Sony granted us
the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software
titles for the PSP in North America. We also signed a similar agreement with
Sony for the PSP covering European territories and Australia. We entered into a
four-year Licensed Publisher Agreement with Sony in April 2004 under which
Sony granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and
distribute software titles for the PlayStation in North America. We also
entered into a similar agreement with Sony for PlayStation covering European
territories and Australia.

We expect to enter into a
platform license with Sony for the PlayStation 3.

Microsoft.

In November 2005,
we entered into a three-year Publisher License Agreement with Microsoft whereby
Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and
distribute software titles for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 in territories to be
determined on a title-by-title basis. The agreement requires us to submit
products to Microsoft for approval and for us to make royalty payments to
Microsoft based on the number of units manufactured. In addition, products are
required to be manufactured by Microsoft approved manufacturers. The agreement,
which expires on November 22, 2008, is automatically renewable for
successive one-year terms, unless either party gives the other prior notice of
non-renewal. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a
material breach. Microsoft also has the right to terminate on a title-by-title
basis. Upon expiration or termination of the agreement, we have certain rights
to sell off existing inventories. We also have a similar agreement in place
with Microsoft for game development and distribution on its previous generation
Xbox system.

In May 2006, we
announced that we would launch

Grand Theft Auto IV

on
the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms in October 2007. In addition, our
Rockstar subsidiary and Microsoft announced that Rockstar will offer exclusive
episodic content for

Grand Theft Auto IV

on
Xbox Live®, Microsoft’s online entertainment and gaming network. The digitally
delivered episodic content will be available for purchase by Xbox Live
subscribers, allowing them to expand their

Grand Theft Auto IV

gameplay
experience.

Nintendo.

We
entered into a Confidential License Agreement with Nintendo that expires in December 2007.
Under the agreement, Nintendo granted us the right and license to develop,
market, publish and distribute software for Nintendo’s GameCube in the western
hemisphere. The agreement requires us to submit products to Nintendo for its
approval. The agreement also provides for Nintendo to be the exclusive
manufacturer of our products and for us to make royalty payments to Nintendo
based on the number of units manufactured. The agreement may be terminated by
either party in the event of a breach and may be terminated by Nintendo in the
event of our bankruptcy. Upon termination of all of our agreements with
Nintendo, we have certain rights to sell off existing inventories. We also
entered into a similar three-year agreement with Nintendo for GameCube covering
European territories.


We also entered into an
agreement with Nintendo that expires in July 2007, granting us the right
and license to develop software for Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance in the western
hemisphere. We entered into a similar agreement with Nintendo for European
territories.

We expect to enter into a
platform license with Nintendo for Wii and DS.

Manufacturing

Sony and Nintendo are the
sole manufacturers of software products sold for use on their respective
hardware platforms. We begin the manufacturing process for our published titles
by placing a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with Sony or
Nintendo and utilizing our line of credit with the manufacturer. We then send
software code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer, together with
related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and
packaging designs for approval, defect testing and manufacture. Games manufactured
by Sony and Nintendo are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of our
manufacturing order. The same procedure applies to games for the Xbox and Xbox
360, although Xbox and Xbox 360 games must be manufactured by manufacturers
pre-approved by Microsoft.

Production of PC software
includes CD-ROM pressing, assembly of components, printing of packaging and
user manuals and shipping of finished goods, which is performed by third-party
vendors in accordance with our specifications, and, to a limited extent, by us.
We believe that there are alternative sources for these services that could be
obtained without delay. We send software code and a prototype of a title,
together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures
and packaging designs to the manufacturers. Games are generally shipped within
two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order.

To date, we have not
experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our
titles or material delays due to manufacturing defects. Our software titles
carry a 90-day limited warranty.

Sales and Marketing

We sell software titles to
retail outlets in North America and Europe through direct relationships with
large retail customers and third-party distributors. Our customers in North
America include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, GameStop, Target, Toys “R”
Us, Wal-Mart and other leading mass merchandisers; video, electronic and toy
stores; national and regional drug stores; supermarket and discount store chains;
and specialty retailers. Our European customers include Carrefour, Dixons,
Karstadt, and Media Saturn. We have sales and marketing operations in
Australia, Austria, Canada, China France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, New
Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Japan and the United Kingdom.

Sales to our five largest
customers in fiscal 2006 accounted for approximately 49.4% of our revenue, with
Wal-Mart, GameStop and Best Buy accounting for 15.4%, 12.6% and 10.2%,
respectively, of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than
10.0% of our revenue for this year.

Our marketing and
promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and broaden distribution
of our titles, promote brand name recognition, assist retailers and properly
position, package and merchandise our titles. We market titles by implementing
public relations campaigns, using print and online advertising, television,
radio spots and outdoor advertising. We believe that we label and market our
products in accordance with ESRB principles and guidelines.

We continue to actively
pursue relationships with participants in the music and entertainment
industries. We believe that the shared demographics between various media and
some of the software titles marketed by our publishing labels provide excellent
cross-promotional opportunities. We continue to work with popular recording
artists to create sophisticated game soundtracks, enter into agreements to
license high-profile names and likenesses, and make arrangements for
co-branding opportunities.


We have numerous titles
that have been designated Sony’s Greatest Hits Program for PlayStation 2 and
PSP, and Microsoft’s Platinum Hits Program titles for Xbox. To qualify for
these programs under our agreements with hardware manufacturers, our products
had to satisfy certain shelf life and sales requirements. In connection with
these programs, we receive manufacturing discounts from Sony and Microsoft.
Nintendo has also established a Player’s Choice Program for the Wii and
GameCube.

We seek to stimulate
continued sales and maximize profit potential by reducing the wholesale prices
of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product.
Price concessions may occur at any time in a product’s life cycle, but
typically occur six to nine months after a product’s initial launch. In fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004, price concessions to retailers amounted to $73.9 million,
$30.4 million and $52.8 million, respectively, and are often related to
products designated as a Greatest or Platinum Hits Program title offered by
Sony and Microsoft. In certain international markets, we provide volume rebates
to stimulate continued product sales.

We also employ various
other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness, including
in-store promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail, co-operative
advertising, as well as attendance at trade shows. We employ separate sales
forces for our publishing and distribution operations. As of October 31,
2006, we had a sales and marketing staff of 256.

Distribution

We distribute our own
titles as well as third-party software, hardware and accessories in North
America through our Jack of All Games subsidiary. We distribute three major
categories of third-party console, handheld and PC products, consisting
principally of newly released and popular software titles, budget and catalog
software titles, and hardware.

We procure products from
suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of
market demand, as well as pre-orders from retailers. We periodically enter into
agreements with our suppliers that provide exclusive distribution rights to
certain products. We carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary
to provide rapid response to retailer orders. We utilize electronic data
interchange with many of our retailers to enhance the efficiency of placing and
shipping orders and receiving payments.

Our Jack of All Games
subsidiary maintains warehouse facilities and sales offices in Ohio and
Ontario, Canada. Products arrive at our warehouses to be picked, packed and
shipped to customers. We generally ship products by common carrier. Backlog is
not material to our business as we generally ship products within seven days of
receipt of orders.

Competition

In our publishing business,
we compete both for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive
entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which is a
large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms. Each of these
competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price
competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns, particularly with
prime-time television spots. These companies may also increase their own
software development efforts. On certain occasions, we have been able to
negotiate marketing reimbursements from the console manufacturers, which has
allowed us to increase marketing exposure for certain of our titles.

We also compete with
domestic companies such as Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ, Midway Games and
Atari and international companies such as SEGA, Vivendi, Ubisoft, SCi
Entertainment, Capcom, Konami and Namco-Bandai. Competition in the
entertainment software industry is based on product quality and features, brand
name recognition, access to distribution channels, price and effectiveness of
marketing. Our business is also driven by hit titles, which require increasing
budgets for development and marketing. The availability of significant
financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and


marketing software games.
Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other
resources than we do, and are able to finance larger budgets for development
and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for
commercially desirable intellectual properties.

Retailers have limited
shelf space and promotional resources, and competition is intense among an
increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and
hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.
Competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require
us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain current sales levels of
our titles. Competitors with more extensive product lines and popular titles
may have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be
able to achieve the levels of support and shelf space that such competitors
receive. Similarly, as competition for popular properties increases, our cost
of acquiring licenses for such properties is likely to increase, resulting in
reduced margins. Prolonged price competition, increased licensing costs or
reduced operating margins would cause our profits to decrease significantly.

Competition for our titles
is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity
of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a
reduction in sell-through of our titles at retail stores. Our titles also
compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures, television
and audio and video products featuring similar themes, online computer programs
and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other
advantages to consumers.

As the installed base of
console and handheld platforms has increased and as new console and handheld
platforms have been introduced, a growing market for used video games has
emerged. We and other software developers have produced a wide variety of
software titles, and to the extent that original purchasers have made titles
available in second-hand markets, consumers have increasingly opted to purchase
used video games rather than pay full retail price for new games. Competition
from this secondary market most impacts our older software titles and titles we
have published for past hardware platforms.

In our distribution
business, we compete with large national companies as well as smaller regional
distributors. We also compete with the efforts of the major entertainment
software companies that distribute directly to retailers or over the Internet.
Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other
resources than we do, and are able to carry larger inventories, adopt more
aggressive pricing policies, and provide more comprehensive product selection
than we can.

International Operations

Sales in international
markets, principally in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have
accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. For fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, approximately 39.4%, 39.8% and 36.8%, respectively, of our net
revenue was earned outside the United States. We are subject to risks inherent
in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international
political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a
significant impact on our operating results. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

Our business is subject to
many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance.
Because of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other
factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial
performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future
performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the
market value of our securities could decline.

The matters
relating to the investigation by the Special Committee of our Board of
Directors and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements may
result in additional SEC inquiries, litigation and governmental enforcement
actions.

In June 2006, our Board of Directors directed a
Special Committee consisting of three independent members of the Board of
Directors to conduct an independent investigation relating to our past stock
option grants. The Special Committee was assisted in the investigation by
outside independent legal counsel and independent accountants. On December 11,
2006, we announced that the Special Committee preliminarily found that there
were improprieties in the process of granting and documenting stock options and
that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock option grants were used for
financial accounting purposes. As described in the Explanatory Note immediately
preceding Part I, Item 1, and in Note 2 “Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
this Form 10-K, as a result of the internal review and independent
investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit Committee agrees, that
incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for
stock-based compensation awards made in certain prior periods. As a result, we
have recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related
tax effects, with regard to certain past stock-based awards, and we have
restated certain previously filed financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

The internal review, the independent investigation,
and related activities have required us to incur substantial expenses for
legal, accounting, tax and other professional services, have diverted
management’s attention from our business, and could in the future harm our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

While we believe that we have made appropriate
judgments in determining the correct measurement dates for our stock-based
compensation awards, the SEC may disagree with the manner in which we have
accounted for and reported the financial impact. Accordingly, there is a risk
that we may have to further restate our prior financial statements, amend prior
filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently contemplated.


Our past stock option granting practices and the
restatement of prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks
associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement
actions. As described in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”, several
derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and
federal courts against our directors and certain of our executive officers
pertaining to, among other things, allegations relating to stock option grants.
In addition, we have responded to the previously disclosed subpoenas and
informal requests for documents and additional information from these agencies.
We intend to continue to fully cooperate with these investigations. No
assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation, regulatory
proceedings or government enforcement actions relating to our past stock
compensation practices. The resolution of these matters will be time consuming,
expensive, and will distract management from the conduct of our business.
Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory
proceedings or government enforcement actions, we could be required to pay
damages, fines or penalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In August 2006, we
received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result of the
delayed filing of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31,
2006 (the “Third Quarter Form 10-Q”), we were not in compliance with
the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14)
and were therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market. On December 29,
2006, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted our request for continued
listing, subject to our filing of the Third Quarter Form 10-Q,
and any required restatements, with the SEC by March 19, 2007, holding our
combined 2005 and 2006 annual meeting by March 27, 2006 and providing
certain information regarding the Special Committee’s independent investigation
to NASDAQ by on or about January 15, 2007, which we have provided. We
anticipate filing our Third Quarter Form 10-Q with the SEC promptly
following the filing of this Form 10-K. We anticipate holding our annual
meeting on or about March 23, 2007. We believe that when we hold our
combined 2005 and 2006 annual meeting, we will have remedied our non-compliance
with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and other applicable Marketplace Rules,
subject to NASDAQ’s affirmative completion of our compliance protocols.
However, if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for
and reported, or not reported, the financial impact of past stock-based
compensation awards, there could be further delays in filing subsequent SEC
reports that might result in delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ
Stock Market.

We have incurred significant losses for the year ended
October 31, 2006, and we may incur future losses.

Although we achieved
increasing levels of revenue and generated profits in each of the years ended October 31,
2002 through 2005, we incurred a significant loss for the year ended October 31,
2006. We expect to incur increased levels of expenses associated with
significant product development and licensing commitments over the next year in
connection with the diversification of our product offerings and the transition
to next-generation platforms. We anticipate that we will continue to incur
losses until such time as we generate sufficient levels of revenue to offset
these increased costs. Continued losses could adversely affect the price of our
common stock and our business.

Our business is
highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video
game platforms, on the continued availability of existing video game platforms,
as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these
platforms.

We derive most of our
revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured
by third parties, such as Sony’s PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PSP; and
Microsoft’s Xbox and Xbox 360. The success of our business is driven in large
part by the availability of an adequate supply of current generation video game
platforms (such as the PlayStation 2), the adequate supply, and, increasingly,
the success of new video game hardware systems (such as the Xbox 360,
PlayStation 3 and the Wii), our ability to accurately predict which platforms
will be successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop


commercially successful
products for these platforms. We must make product development decisions and
commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of
a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may not
succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. Alternatively, a
platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful
than we had initially anticipated, causing us to miss a meaningful revenue
opportunity. If the platforms for which we are developing products are not
available in adequate quantities to meet consumer demand or are lower than our
expectations, or do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue will suffer,
we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing
our products, and our financial performance will be harmed.

We expect the average price of current generation
software titles to continue to decline.

Consumer demand for
software for current generation platforms has declined as newer and more
advanced hardware platforms achieve market acceptance. As the gaming software
industry transitions to next-generation platforms, we expect few, if any,
current generation titles will be able to command premium price points and we
expect that these titles will be subject to price reductions earlier in their
product life cycles than we have seen in prior years. As a result, we have reduced
prices for our current generation software titles and we expect to continue to
reduce prices for our current generation software titles which will have a
negative impact on our operating results.

The market for our
titles is characterized by short product life cycles. Delays in product
releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may
have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

The market for our titles
is characterized by short product life cycles and frequent introductions of new
products. New products may not achieve significant market acceptance or
generate sufficient sales to permit us to recover development, manufacturing
and marketing costs associated with these products. The life cycle of a title
generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months
after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues
associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high
percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product, delays
in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or
more new products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations.
We have experienced delays in product releases and in fiscal 2005 our revenue
was negatively impacted by product returns due to the re-rating by the ESRB of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

from “M”
(age 17 and older) to “AO” (age 18 and older). Such delays and disruptions may
occur in the future.

We are dependent on
the future success of our Grand Theft Auto products and we must continue to
publish “hit” titles in order to successfully compete in our industry.

Grand Theft Auto

and certain of our other titles are “hit” products and have historically
accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. If we fail to continue to
develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or experience any
delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of
our “hit” titles, our revenues and profits may decrease substantially and we
may incur losses. For the years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 our

Grand Theft Auto

titles accounted for 22.4%, 38.2% and 34.3%
of our total revenue, respectively, and our ten best selling titles accounted
for approximately 38.4%, 48.2% and 46.3% of our net revenues, respectively. In
addition, competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number
of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry. Hit
products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer
spending than we anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our
products and services to fall below our expectations. If our competitors
develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on
payment models perceived as offering better value (such as pay-for play or
subscription-based models), or if we do


not continue to develop
consistently high quality and well-received products and services, our revenue
and profitability will decline.

Our software titles
compete for the leisure and entertainment time of consumers, which has
intensified in part due to advances in technology.

We face increasing competition
for the leisure and entertainment time of consumers. Our publishing business
competes with all other sources of information and entertainment, including
television, movies, music, live events, radio broadcasts, home video products,
print media and the Internet. Technological advancements, such as new streaming
capabilities and downloading entertainment via the Internet, have increased the
number of media and entertainment choices available to consumers and presents
challenges as our audience becomes more fragmented. The increasing number of
choices available to consumers could negatively impact demand for our products,
or require us to use additional resources to develop more sophisticated
software, or both. If we do not respond effectively to increases in the leisure
and entertainment choices available to consumers, it could have an adverse
effect on our competitive position and revenues.

If we fail to retain creative and product development
personnel, our business could be seriously harmed.

We are highly dependent on
the expertise, skills and knowledge of certain of our Rockstar employees
responsible for content creation and development of

Grand Theft Auto

and other titles. Although we entered into
employment agreements with our key Rockstar employees, and we have granted them
incentives including an internal royalty program based on sales of Rockstar
published products, we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at
current compensation levels, or at all. The compensation arrangements with such
Rockstar employees could result in increased expenses and have a negative
impact on our operating results. In addition, if one or more of these
individuals leave our company, we may lose additional personnel, experience
material interruptions in product development and delays in bringing products
to market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and
prospects.

We depend on our key management personnel.

Our continued success will
depend to a significant extent on our senior management. The loss of the
services of our executive officers could significantly harm our business,
financial condition and operating results. In addition, if one or more key
employees join a competitor or form a competing company, we may lose
additional personnel, experience material interruptions in product development,
delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships
with licensors, suppliers and customers, which could significantly harm our
business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, failure to
continue to attract and retain qualified management personnel could adversely
affect our business and prospects.

Our ability to
acquire licenses to intellectual property, especially for sports titles,
impacts our revenue and profitability. Competition for these licenses may make
them more expensive and increase our costs.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate
intellectual property owned by others. For example, our 2K Sports products
include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players’ associations.
Similarly, some of our other titles are based on key film and television
licenses. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to
maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses with significant
commercial value, our revenues and profitability will decline significantly.
Competition for these licenses may also drive up the advances, guarantees and
royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase
our costs.


Our business is
dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development
arrangements with third parties.

Our success depends on our
ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis. We
rely on third-party software developers for the development of certain of our
titles. Quality third-party developers are continually in high demand. Software
developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to
develop software for us in the future. Due to the limited number of third-party
software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them, these
developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or
within acceptable quality standards, if at all. We have entered into agreements
with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive
entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in
our titles. These agreements typically require us to make advance payments, pay
royalties and satisfy other conditions. Our advance payments may not be
sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully, which
could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring
particular products to market. Software development costs, promotion and
marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and third-party
licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential
profits derived from sales of our software. Future sales of our titles may not
be sufficient to recover advances to software developers and licensors, and we
may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual
commitments to such developers. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under
agreements with third-party developers and licensors, the agreements may be
terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us, and materially
adversely affect our operating results.

We are subject to
product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs,
and we must adapt to changes in software technologies.

We depend on third-party software developers and our
internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software
within anticipated release schedules and cost projections. The development
cycle for new titles ranges from twelve to thirty-six months and is expected to
increase in connection with the development of next-generation software. After
development of a product, it may take between nine to twelve additional months
to develop the product for other hardware platforms. If developers experience
financial difficulties, additional costs or unanticipated development delays,
we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted
costs. Certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain
provisions that would impose penalties in the event that we fail to meet agreed
upon software release dates.

Additionally, in order to
stay competitive, our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to
rapid technological changes affecting software development. Any inability to
respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render
our products obsolete or less marketable.

The interactive
entertainment software industry is highly competitive both for our publishing
and distribution operations.

We compete for both licenses to properties and the
sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo,
each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own
platforms. Each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand
significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns,
particularly for television spots. These companies may also increase their own
software development efforts or focus on developing software products for
third-party platforms. We also compete with domestic game publishers such as
Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ, Midway Games and Atari and international
publishers, such as SEGA, Vivendi, Ubisoft, SCi Entertainment, Capcom, Konami
and Namco-Bondai. As our business is driven by hit titles, which require
increasing budgets for development and marketing, the availability of
significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in
developing and marketing software games. Some of our competitors


have greater financial, technical, personnel and other
resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and
marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially
desirable properties. Our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment
such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products featuring
similar themes, online computer programs and forms of entertainment which may
be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

Our distribution business also operates in a highly
competitive environment. Competition is based primarily on breadth,
availability and quality of product lines; price; terms and conditions of sale;
credit terms and availability; speed and accuracy of delivery; and
effectiveness of sales and marketing programs. Our competitors include
regional, national and international distributors, as well as hardware
manufacturers and software publishers. We may lose market share or be forced in
the future to reduce our prices in response to our competitors. Our
distribution business has been adversely affected by lower sales volume of
software titles, a decrease in average selling prices of interactive
entertainment products as our industry transitions to next-generation
technology and increased competition in the value software market.

A number of software
publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are
currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet.
Future increased consumer acceptance and increases in the availability of
online games or technological advances in online game software sales or the
Internet could result in a decline in platform-based software sales and
negatively impact sales of our products. Direct sales of software over the
Internet by our competitors could materially adversely affect our distribution
business.

Increased
competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers
could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater
expenses to market our titles.

Retailers have limited
shelf space and promotional resources, and competition is intense among newly
introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of
shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail shelf space is
expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing
expenditures to maintain desirable levels of sales of our titles. Competitors with
more extensive lines and popular titles may have greater bargaining power with
retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able, or we may have to pay more than our
competitors, to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space.

A limited number of
customers account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of a
principal customer could seriously hurt our business.

A substantial portion of
our product sales are made to a limited number of customers. Sales to our five
largest customers accounted for approximately 49.4% and 40.7% of our net
revenues, for the year ended October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with
Wal-Mart, GameStop and Best Buy accounting for 15.4%, 12.6% and 10.2%,
respectively, of such revenues for the year ended October 31, 2006. Our
sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long-term
agreements or other commitments, and our customers may terminate their
relationship with us at any time. Certain of our customers may decline to carry
products containing mature content. The loss of our relationships with
principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers, including as
a result of a product being rated “AO” (age 18 and over), could materially
adversely affect our business and operating results. Bankruptcies or
consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our
business.


Returns of our
published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our
customers may adversely affect our operating results.

We are exposed to the risk
of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers. Our
distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right
to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept
product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and
negotiate accommodations to customers which include credits and returns, when
demand for specific products falls below expectations. We accept returns and
grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and
revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price
concessions. While we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and
price concessions, if return rates and price concessions for our published
titles exceed our reserves, our revenues could decline.

Failure to collect
our accounts receivable on a timely basis will negatively impact our cash flow.

Our sales are typically
made on credit. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment by our
customers. As a result, we are subject to credit risks, particularly in the
event that a significant amount of our receivables represent sales to a limited
number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets. Although we
continually assess the creditworthiness of our customers, which are principally
large, national retailers, if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable
as they become due, it could adversely affect our financial condition and cash
flow. From time to time we purchase insurance from financial institutions on
our receivables, with certain limits, to help protect us from loss in the event
of a customer’s bankruptcy or insolvency.

We are subject to
the rating of our content by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Failure to
obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively impact our
sales as could a game re-rating.

We submit our game
products to the ESRB, a voluntary ratings organization that requires publishers
to submit game content for rating. The ESRB system provides consumers with
information about game content using a rating symbol that suggests the
appropriate player age group, and content descriptor information, such as
graphic violence, profanity, or sexually explicit material. The ESRB rating is
printed on each game package and retailers may use the rating to restrict sales
to the recommended age groups. The ESRB may impose significant penalties on
game publishers for violations of its rules on rating or marketing a game,
including revocation of a rating or monetary fines. Certain countries have also
established similar rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those
countries. We believe that we comply with rating system requirements and
properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptors. In some
instances, we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the
expected rating, which could delay or disrupt the release of our products.
Sales of some of our titles, however, have been prohibited in certain
countries. In the United States, we expect our software titles to receive ESRB
ratings of “E” (age 6 and older), “E10+” (age 10 and older), “T” (age 13 and
over) or “M” (age 17 and over). In addition to these ratings, the ESRB may also
rate a game as “AO” (age 18 and over). Many of our Rockstar titles and certain
of our 2K Games titles have been rated “M” by the ESRB. If we are unable to
obtain “M” ratings as a result of changes in the ESRB’s ratings standards or
for other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this area, our
business and prospects could be negatively affected. In the event any of our
games are re-rated by the ESRB, we may be required to record a reserve for
anticipated product returns and inventory obsolescence which could expose us to
additional litigation, administrative fines and penalties and other potential
liabilities, and could adversely affect our operating results.


We entered into a
Consent Order with the Staff of the Federal Trade.

The Federal Trade
Commission (“FTC”) has concluded its previously reported inquiry regarding the
advertising claims for

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

following the re-rating of the title by the ESRB. In July 2006,
we entered into an agreement with the staff of the FTC containing a Consent Order
that settled all outstanding matters pending before the FTC. Under the terms of
the Consent Order, we established, and must implement, and maintain a
comprehensive system reasonably designed to ensure that all content in an
electronic game is considered and reviewed in preparing submissions to a U.S.
rating authority. The companies also agreed to accurately represent the rating
and content descriptors for games they publish and to disclose to consumers the
presence of any content relevant to the rating that was not disclosed to the
rating authority. If we fail to comply with the terms of the Consent Order, we
could be required to pay substantial fines, penalties and judgments and our
operations could be significantly harmed.

We are currently in
litigation that could negatively impact our financial results.

We are currently named as a defendant in class actions
complaints alleging consumer deception, false advertising and common law fraud,
class action and derivative complaints alleging violations of certain federal
securities laws, an action brought by the City Attorney of Los Angeles and
actions brought by the estates of certain individuals claiming violations of
State manufacturing liability and wrongful death statutes.

We cannot predict the
outcome of these pending matters, which could result in the imposition of
significant fines and penalties and/or judgments that could negatively impact
our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we have incurred
and expect to continue to incur significant legal and other professional fees
and expenses in connection with pending litigation as well as pending
regulatory matters which have also diverted management’s attention from our
business. See Item 3—“Legal Proceedings”.

We have received
requests for information from certain state and federal regulatory authorities.

We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by
the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting production of
documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including
those relating to, among other things: the so-called “Hot Coffee” scenes in
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas; the work of  our Board of Directors,
all Board Committees, and the Special Litigation Committee; certain
acquisitions entered into by  us ; billing and payment records
relating to Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLC (“PWC”) and the termination of PWC
as  our  auditors; communications to financial analysts and
stockholders about acquisitions and financial results; compensation and human
resources documents of certain  of our  directors and employees;
stock-based compensation; the SEC ’s  June 2006 inquiry; legal
services performed for employees; corporate credit card and expense records of
certain individuals; the SEC bar of  our  former Chief Executive
Officer, Ryan Brant; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies
and questionnaires.  We are fully cooperating and providing the
documents and information called for by the subpoenas.

We have also received notice from the SEC that it is
conducting an informal non-public investigation into certain stock option
grants made by us from January 1997 to the present. We and the Special
Committee are fully cooperating with the SEC.

We have also received requests for documents and
information relating to

Grand Theft Auto:
San Andreas

from certain state Attorneys General, which matters have
been dormant for some time.

We have also received a request for information from
the Internal Revenue Service that includes a request for records relating to
the grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken by us pursuant to
Internal


Revenue Code Section 162(m) for the period
from October 31, 2000 to October 31, 2004. We are fully cooperating
and providing the requested documents.

These regulatory matters
could divert resources away from our business, which could undermine our
ability to effectively compete and seriously hurt our business and prospects. While
under review, our ability to enter into capital-raising, strategic and other
potential corporate transactions on favorable terms could be severely hampered.
We cannot predict the outcome of these pending reviews, which could ultimately
result in the imposition  of significant
fines and other penalties and/or judgments 
that could negatively impact our results of operations and  financial condition.

Our business and
products are subject to increasing potential legislation. The adoption of such
proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products.

Several proposals have
been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry, including a Senate
bill, referred to as The Family Entertainment Protection Act. This bill
proposes to prohibit the sale of “M” rated, “AO” rated and “Rating Pending”
products to under-17 audiences. If the bill is adopted into law, it may
limit the potential market for our “M” rated products, and adversely affect our
operating results. Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws
regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the
Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United
States, proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate
the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing violent or
sexually explicit material by prohibiting the sale of such products to under 17
or 18 audiences and proposing penalties for noncompliance, and certain states
have recently sought to adopt laws regulating “M” or “AO” rated products or
products otherwise depicting violent or sexually explicit materials. While such
legislation has been successfully enjoined by industry and retail groups, the
adoption into law of such legislation in federal and/or in state jurisdictions
in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for
our “M” rated titles.

Content policies
adopted by retailers, consumer opposition and litigation could negatively
impact sales of our products

.

Retailers may decline to
sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually
explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their
businesses. If retailers decline to sell our “M” rated products or products
containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other
objectionable content generally, or if our “M” rated products are rated “AO,”
we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles,
which in the case of our best selling

Grand
Theft Auto

titles could seriously hurt our business. Consumer
advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software
containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other
objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by
engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns. Additionally, although
lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a
result of video games have been unsuccessful in the courts, claims of this kind
have been asserted against us from time to time. See Item 3. “Legal
Proceedings.”

We cannot publish
our console titles without the approval of hardware licensors who are also our
competitors.

We are required to obtain
a license from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, who are also our competitors, to
develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms. Our
existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication
of new titles on a title-by-title basis. As a result, the number of titles we
are able to publish for these hardware platforms, and our ability to manage the
timing of the release of these titles and, accordingly, our net revenues from
titles for these hardware platforms, may be limited. If any licensor chooses
not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term, or
if the licensor were to terminate our license for any reason, we would be
unable to publish additional


titles for that licensor’s
platform. Termination of any such agreements could seriously hurt our business
and prospects.

Microsoft released its
next-generation hardware platform into the North American marketplace in November 2005,
and each of Sony and Nintendo introduced their respective next-generation
platforms into the marketplace during November 2006. Certain platform
licensors have retained the right to change fee structures for online gameplay,
and each licensor’s ability to set royalty rates makes it difficult for us to
forecast our costs. Increased costs could negatively impact our operating
margins. We may be unable to enter into license agreements for certain
next-generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to enter
into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business.

Our quarterly
operating results are highly seasonal and may fluctuate significantly, which
could cause our stock price to decline.

We have experienced and
may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results.
The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales typically
higher during the fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal
quarters), due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday
buying season. Our failure or inability to introduce products on a timely basis
to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and
operating results. The uncertainties associated with software development,
manufacturing lead times, production delays and the approval process for
products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to
predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us
to fail to meet financial expectations. In future quarters, our operating
results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors
and the price of our stock could decline significantly.

Our expansion and
acquisitions may strain our operations, and we may not have sufficient
financial resources to continue to expand our operations at previous levels.

We have expanded through internal growth and
acquisitions, which has placed and may continue to place a significant strain
on our management, administrative, operational, financial and other resources.
We have expanded our publishing operations, significantly increased our advances
to licensors and developers and manufacturing expenditures and enlarged our
work force. To successfully manage this growth, we must continue to implement
and improve our operating systems as well as hire, train and manage a
substantial and increasing number of management, technical, marketing,
administrative and other personnel. We may be unable to effectively manage our
expanding and geographically dispersed operations.

We have acquired rights to various properties and
businesses, and we intend to continue to pursue opportunities by making
selective acquisitions consistent with our business strategy. We may be unable
to successfully integrate new personnel, properties or businesses into our
operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate personnel, properties or
businesses into our operations, we may incur significant charges.

Our publishing and
distribution activities require significant cash resources. We may be required
to seek debt or equity financing to fund the cost of continued expansion and
there is no guarantee that could obtain additional financing on acceptable
terms. The issuance of equity securities would result in dilution to the
interests of our stockholders.

Our business is
subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry, and we
may fail to properly assess consumer tastes and preferences.

Our business is subject to
all of the risks generally associated with the entertainment industry and,
accordingly, our future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond
our control, including


the popularity, price and
timing of new hardware platforms being released; economic, political and
military conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending;
changes in consumer demographics; the availability and popularity of other
forms of entertainment; and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences,
which may change rapidly and cannot be predicted. In order to plan for
acquisition and promotional activities, we must anticipate and respond to rapid
changes in consumer tastes and preferences. A decline in the popularity of
certain game genres or particular platforms could cause sales of our titles to
decline dramatically. The period of time necessary to develop new game titles,
obtain approvals of platform licensors and produce finished products is
unpredictable. During this period, consumer appeal for a particular title may
decrease, causing product sales to fall short of expectations.

We cannot be
certain of the future effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting or the impact of the same on our operations or the market price for
our common stock.

Pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K our assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, our independent
registered public accounting firm is required to audit our assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and separately
report on whether it believes we maintain, in all material respects, effective
internal controls over financial reporting. Although we believe that we
currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we cannot be
certain that future material changes to our internal controls over financial
reporting will be effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness
of our internal controls over financial reporting, we might be subject to
sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such
action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our
common stock.

We may not be able
to protect our proprietary rights or avoid claims that we infringe on the
proprietary rights of others.

We develop proprietary software and have obtained the
rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties. We
attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright,
trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on
disclosure, copying and distribution. Our software is susceptible to piracy and
unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to
reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production
techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy operations have
also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated
copies of our software over the Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate
protective measures into our software, piracy of our products could negatively
impact our future profitability.

With advances in
technology, game content and software graphics are expected to become more
realistic. As a result, we believe that interactive entertainment software will
increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the
intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we receive notices
from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging
infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our software
and technologies and the software and technologies of third-party developers
and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not
infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that
infringement of proprietary rights of others has or may occur. Any claims of
infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming, costly and
difficult to defend. Moreover, intellectual property litigation or claims could
require us to discontinue the distribution of products, obtain a license or
redesign our products, which could result in additional substantial costs and
material delays.


Our software is
susceptible to errors, which can harm our financial results and reputation.

The technological
advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more
complex software products. As software products become more complex, the risk
of undetected errors in products when first introduced increases. If, despite
testing, errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been
made, we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance,
product returns, loss of revenues and damage to our reputation.

Gross margins
relating to our distribution business have been historically narrow which
increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating results.

As a result of intense
price competition, our gross margins in our distribution business have
historically been narrow and may continue to be narrow in the future.
Accordingly, slight variations in operating costs and expenses could result in
losses in our distribution business from period to period.

We may not be able
to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a
sudden decrease in demand.

A significant portion of
our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel
and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in revenues, we may not
be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, or make other changes to our cost
structure without disruption to our operations or without significant
termination and exit costs. Management may not be able to implement such
actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in
revenues and profit. Moreover, reducing costs may impair our ability to produce
and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future.

Our distribution
business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products
to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis.

Our ability to obtain particular products in required
quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is important to our
success. In most cases, we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with
suppliers. In certain product categories, limited price concessions or return
rights offered by publishers may have a bearing on the amount of product we may
be willing to purchase. Our industry may experience significant hardware supply
shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to
supply certain products on a timely basis. As a result, we have experienced,
and may in the future continue to experience, short-term hardware inventory
shortages. Further, manufacturers or publishers who currently distribute their
products through us may decide to distribute, or to substantially increase
their existing distribution, through other distributors, or directly to
retailers.

If manufacturers do not
supply us with finished titles on favorable terms without delays, our operations
would be materially interrupted, and we would be unable to obtain sufficient
amounts of our product to sell to our customers. If we cannot obtain sufficient
product supplies, our net revenues will decline and we could incur losses.

We are subject to
the risk that our inventory values may decline and protective terms under
supplier arrangements may not adequately cover the decline in values.

The interactive
entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the
introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry
standards. These changes may cause inventory to decline substantially in value
over time or to become obsolete. We are exposed to inventory risk in our
distribution business to the extent that supplier price concessions are not
available to us on all products or quantities. In addition, suppliers may
become insolvent and unable to fulfill price concession obligations.


We are subject to
risks and uncertainties of international trade, including fluctuations in the
values of local foreign currencies against the dollar.

Sales in international
markets, primarily in the United Kingdom and other territories in Europe, have
accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues. Sales in international
markets accounted for approximately 39.4% and 39.8%, respectively, of our net
revenues for the years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We
are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit
risks; tariffs and duties; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
shipping delays; and international political, regulatory and economic
developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating
results. All of our international sales are made in local currencies, which
could fluctuate against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts
to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our results of
operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency
fluctuations.

The market price
for our common stock may be highly volatile as a result of, among other things,
factors affecting the industry.

The market price of our
common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. Factors such as
our operating results, announcements by us or our competitors and various
factors affecting the interactive entertainment software industry may have a
significant impact on the market price of our common stock.

We seek to manage
our business with a view to achieving long-term results, and this could have a
negative effect on short-term trading.

We focus on creation of
shareholder value over time, and we intend to make decisions that will be
consistent with this long-term view. As a result, some of our decisions, such
as whether to make or discontinue operating investments, manage our balance
sheet and capital structure, or pursue or discontinue strategic initiatives,
may be in conflict with the objectives of short-term traders. Further, this
could adversely affect our quarterly or other short-term results of operations.

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

In July 2005, we received three purported class
action complaints against us and Rockstar Games, two of which were filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and one such
complaint which was filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District
of Pennsylvania. On September 8, 2005, another similar complaint was filed
in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial District, St. Clair County,
Illinois and then removed to United States District Court for the Southern
District of Illinois. The plaintiffs, alleged purchasers of our

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

game, allege
that we and Rockstar Games engaged in consumer deception, false advertising and
common law fraud and were unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure
of us and Rockstar Games to disclose that

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content, which resulted
in the game receiving an “M” rating from the ESRB rather than an “AO” rating.
The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of various violations of
law and litigation costs. The New York and Pennsylvania actions, together with
an action commenced against us and Rockstar Games in the United States District
for the Southern District of New York in August 2006, have been
consolidated in the Southern District of New York under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer
Litigation

, (05-CV-6734 (BSJ)) and the Illinois
action has been transferred to the Southern District of New York for
coordinated pretrial proceedings pursuant to an Order of Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation. These cases have been consolidated for pretrial
proceedings under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto
Video Game Consumer Litigation

(No. II)

,
06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD). On June 7, 2006  plaintiffs filed a Consolidated and Amended
Complaint. On July 31, 2006, we and Rockstar Games filed a Partial Motion
to Dismiss those claims brought under the laws of states other than states
where the named plaintiffs reside and were purportedly injured. By an Opinion
and Order dated October 25, 2006, the Partial Motion to Dismiss was denied.
On November 10, 2006 we and Rockstar Games filed a Motion to Deny
Certification of the proposed nationwide class. On November 17, 2006 we
and Rockstar Games served an answer denying the allegations in the Consolidated
and Amended Complaint and asserting various affirmative defenses. On January 24,
2007, the Plaintiffs cross-moved for certification of the proposed nationwide
class. Consolidated discovery in these actions is proceeding.

In November 2006, a complaint was filed against
us and Rockstar Games in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, alleging that we and Rockstar Games engaged in consumer
deception, were unjustly enriched and in breach of warranty as a result of the
alleged failure of us and Rockstar Games to disclose that

Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content, which resulted in the
game receiving an “M” rating from the ESRB rather than an “AO” rating. The
complaint seeks unspecified damages, declarations of various violations of law
and litigation costs. We and Rockstar Games have filed a Notice of Tag-along
Action with the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, requesting that
the case be transferred to the Southern District of New York for pretrial
consolidation with

In re Grand Theft Auto
Video Game Consumer Litigation (No. II)

, 06-MD-1739
(SWK)(MHD). On January 26, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation issued a Conditional Transfer Order, transferring this action to the
Southern District of New York for pre-trial consolidation with

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer Litigation

(No. II)

, 06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD).


In January 2006, the City Attorney for the City
of Los Angeles filed a complaint against us and Rockstar Games in the Superior
Court of the State of California. The complaint alleges that we and Rockstar
Games violated sections of the California Business and Professions Code
prohibiting untrue and misleading statements and unfair competition and that we
and Rockstar Games were unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure to
disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content which should have resulted in the game receiving an
Adults Only (“AO”) rating from the ESRB rather than a Mature (“M”) rating. The
complaint also alleges that we made misleading statements as to the origin of
the “hidden” content. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, restitution for
purchasers of the game and civil fines. The action has been removed to the
United States District Court, Central District of California and we moved to
dismiss the complaint. The plaintiff has moved to remand the action to state
court and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has issued an order
transferring the action to the Southern District of New York  and the action was consolidated for pre-trial
purposes with

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer
Litigation

(No. II)

,
06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD).

In February and March 2006, an aggregate of
four purported class action complaints were filed against us, our Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Global Operating
Officer in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (the “New York Actions”) and one such purported class action was filed in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the “Michigan
Action”). The New York plaintiffs are Max Kaplan, John Fenninger, David Andrews
and David Toth and the Michigan plaintiff was The City of Flint and Daniel J.
Hall on behalf of The City of Flint Employees’ Retirement Pension Fund. The
complaints allege that the defendants violated Sections 10(b), 20(a) and Rule 10b-5
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) by making or causing us
to make untrue statements or failing to disclose in certain press releases and
SEC periodic reports that, among other things:

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content which should have
resulted in the game receiving an Adults Only (“AO”) rating from the ESRB
rather than a Mature (“M”) rating; the defendants attempted to bolster sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

by
concealing the “adult content” from retailers who refused to carry AO material;
our management failed to keep our Board of Directors informed of important
issues or failed to do so in a timely fashion; and we were misstating
capitalized software development costs and amortization expense and had
inadequate internal controls and procedures to ensure accuracy in our reported
financial results. The plaintiffs seek to recover unspecified damages and their
costs. The plaintiffs in the Michigan Action voluntarily dismissed their
complaint without prejudice. On July 12, 2006, the Court entered Orders
appointing the New York City Pension Funds as lead plaintiff and directing the
filing of a consolidated amended complaint within sixty (60) days. Plaintiffs
filed a consolidated and amended complaint on September 11, 2006. The
amended complaint added claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act related to allegedly improper stock option granting practices
at the Company. On December 11, 2006, we announced the preliminary results
of an internal investigation into our historical stock option granting
practices. The preliminary findings showed that there were
improprieties in the process of granting and documenting stock options, and
that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock option grants were used for
financial accounting purposes. We further announced that we will need to restate
previous financial statements and that our financial statements between 1997
and April 30, 2006, are not reliable. As a result of these announcements
the parties have entered into a stipulation modifying the current scheduling
order. Pursuant to the stipulation, all pending deadlines have been stayed
pending a decision by plaintiffs as to whether they will file a second amended
complaint reflecting our recent announcements.

In January 2006, the St. Clair
Shores General Employees Retirement System filed a purported class and
derivative action complaint in the Southern District of New York against us, as
nominal defendant, and certain of our officers and directors and certain former
officers and directors. The factual allegations in this action are similar to
the allegations contained in the New York Actions. Plaintiff asserts that
certain defendants breached their fiduciary duty by selling their stock while
in possession of certain material non-public information and breached their
fiduciary duty and violated Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9
of the


Exchange Act by failing to disclose
material facts in our 2003, 2004 and 2005 proxy statements in which we
solicited approval to increase share availability under our 2002 Stock Option
Plan. Plaintiff seeks the return of all profits from the alleged insider
trading conducted by the individual defendants who sold our stock, unspecified
compensatory damages with interest and their costs in the action. A motion to
stay the action pending the determination of an investigation by the Special
Committee was filed with the Court. On October 4, 2006, the Court issued
an order granting the motion and staying the proceedings for a period of 150
days from the date of the Order. On January 17, 2007, the plaintiffs moved
for an order granting limited relief from the Court’s October 4, 2006 stay
of the proceedings in order to file an Amended Derivative and Class Action
Complaint.

In July 2006, Richard Lasky filed a purported
derivative action complaint in the Southern District of New York against us, as
nominal defendant, and certain of our officers and directors and certain former
officers and directors. The complaint alleges violations of federal and state
law, including violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Exchange Act, breaches
of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate
assets and unjust enrichment that allegedly occurred between January 2000
and the present. The complaint also asserts claims alleging the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the granting of stock
options to certain officers and directors since 1997. The complaint seeks
unspecified damages against all of the individual defendants, reimbursement
from certain of the defendants of bonuses or other incentive or equity based
compensation paid to them by us during our fiscal year ended October 31,
2003, equitable and other relief relating to the proceeds from certain of the
defendants’ alleged improper trading activity in our stock, adoption of certain
corporate governance proposals and recovery of litigation costs.

On August 22, 2006, a purported derivative
complaint was filed by Raeda Karadsheh in the United States District Court of
the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain
of our current and former officers and directors. The Karadsheh Complaint
asserts claims related to our stock option granting practices. On November 22,
2006, the Court entered an Order consolidating the Lasky and Karadsheh actions
and providing plaintiffs with forty-five (45) days from the date of the Order
to file a consolidated complaint. The Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint
on January 22, 2007. The consolidated complaint focuses exclusively on our
historical stock option granting practices.

In January 2006, Todd Veeck filed a complaint in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against us pursuant to 8 DEL. C.

§ 220 to compel inspection of our books
and records in order to “investigate” possible breaches of fiduciary duties
with regard to the creation, development, marketing and sale of our

Grand Theft Auto

line of products. The
parties were able to amicably resolve this action, which was dismissed with
prejudice on December 11, 2006.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of
the Estates of Arnold Strickland, James Crump and Ace Mealer brought an action
in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against us, Sony Computer
Entertainment America Inc. (“SCEA”), Sony Corporation of America (“SCA”),
Wal-Mart, GameStop and Devin Moore alleging under Alabama’s manufacturers’
liability and wrongful death statutes that our video games designed,
manufactured, marketed and/or supplied to Mr. Moore resulted in “copycat
violence” that caused the death of Messrs. Strickland, Crump and Mealer.
The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the
defendants in excess of $600 million. Wal-Mart, SCEA and SCA have tendered
their defense and requested indemnification from us, and we have accepted such
tender. Our motion to dismiss the action was denied and we moved to have
certain issues certified for an immediate interlocutory appeal before the
Alabama Supreme Court. We also separately pursued a petition to dismiss claims
against us and Rockstar Games, for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Alabama
Supreme Court declined to accept the interlocutory appeal, but agreed to hear
the petition to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. Briefing
has been completed on such petition, and the matter is now pending before the
Supreme Court. In April 2006, the plaintiffs filed a Third Amended
Complaint to add a claim for civil conspiracy; we and our co-defendants have
moved to dismiss that claim and the motion is pending. In


October  2006, the trial court amended a prior
Scheduling Order to set (a) a hearing on the admissibility of Plaintiffs’
expert opinions for April 6, 2007; (b) completion of all fact and
expert discovery by October 12, 2007; (c) mediation for November 8,
2007; and (d) trial (if necessary) to commence no earlier than January 14,
2008.

In September 2006, the personal representatives
of the Estates of Verlin Posey, Tryone Posey, and Marilea Schmid brought an
action in the Second Judicial District of Bernalillo County, New Mexico in
Albuquerque against us; Rockstar Games; SCEA; SCA and Cody Posey (“Posey”),
alleging under New Mexico’s products liability and wrongful death statutes that
our video games resulted in “copycat violence” that caused Posey to shoot and
kill his father (Verlin Posey), stepmother (Tryone Posey) and stepsister
(Marilea Schmid). At his criminal trial, Posey argued self-defense, and
presented extensive testimony of long-term substantial physical abuse by his
father. Posey was convicted of manslaughter in his father’s death, second
degree murder for his stepmother’s death, and first degree murder for his
stepsister’s death. At sentencing in April 2006, the judge concluded that
Posey suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and had “snapped”
when he committed the killings; rather than sentence Posey to life in prison,
the judge sentenced him to a juvenile facility until he turns twenty-one. The
suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants
in excess of $600 million. SCEA and SCA have tendered their defense and
requested indemnification from us, and we have accepted such tender. Copies of
the Complaint and Summonses were received by us in December 2006; and we
moved to dismiss the Complaint on January 19, 2007.

We intend to vigorously defend and seek dismissal of
these matters and, with respect to the derivative actions, we have been advised
that the individual defendants will vigorously defend such actions. However, we
cannot predict the outcome of these matters and, if determined adversely to us,
such matters, either singly or in the aggregate, could result in the imposition
of significant judgments, fines and/or penalties which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We have received notice from the SEC that it is
conducting an informal non-public investigation into certain stock option
grants made by us from January 1997 to the present. Prior to receiving the
notice, we had initiated an internal review of our option grants, led by a
committee consisting of independent board members who have retained independent
legal counsel and accountants to assist in the review. We and the Special
Committee are fully cooperating with the SEC.

We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by
the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting production of
documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including
those relating to, among other things: the so-called “Hot Coffee” scenes in
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas; the work of  our Board of Directors,
all Board Committees, and the Special Litigation Committee; certain
acquisitions entered into by  us ; billing and payment records
relating to Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLC (“PWC”) and the termination of PWC
as  our  auditors; communications to financial analysts and
stockholders about acquisitions and financial results; compensation and human
resources documents of certain  of our  directors and employees;
stock-based compensation; the SEC ’s  June 2006 inquiry; legal
services performed for employees; corporate credit card and expense records of
certain individuals; the SEC bar of  our  former Chief Executive
Officer, Ryan Brant; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies
and questionnaires.  We are fully cooperating and providing the
documents and information called for by the subpoenas.

We have also received a request for information from
the Internal Revenue Service that includes a request for records relating to
the grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken by us pursuant to
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for the period from October 31,
2000 to October 31, 2004. We are fully cooperating and providing the
requested documents.

We are also involved in
other routine litigation in the ordinary course of business, which in our
opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
cash flows or results of operations.

Dividend
Policy.

To date, we have not declared or paid
any cash dividends. The payment of dividends, if any, in the future is within
the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings,
capital requirements and other relevant factors. We presently intend to retain
all earnings to finance continued growth and development of our business and we
do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Stock
Repurchases.

In January 2003, the Board of
Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase
up to $25.0 million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or
in privately negotiated transactions. During June and August 2005, we
repurchased 520,341 and 405,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock at an
aggregate cost of $24.9 million and subsequently retired these shares in August 2005.
No such repurchases were made during the year ended October 31, 2006 and
we remain authorized to repurchase an additional $71,000 of shares under the
program as of such date.

statements of operations for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and October 31,
2004 have been restated as set forth in this 2006 Form 10-K. The

Includes $28.3 million of non-cash impairment
charges for the write-off of intangibles, fixed assets and software development
costs and other assets, of which $21.1 million was related to studio
closures, and $5.3 million of severance and other costs, primarily
associated with studio closures. Also includes an $8.1 million non-cash
impairment charge for the write-down of goodwill and fixed assets of our
Joytech subsidiary. In addition, we increased the valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets by $63.5 million and reversed a corresponding amount
of income tax benefit in the 2006 period due to uncertainty surrounding the realizability
of such deferred tax assets.

(2)

Sales of

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

in North America during fiscal 2005 were
negatively impacted by product returns and related costs as a result of the
re-rating of this title from “M” to “AO.” In July 2005, we initially
recorded a provision of $32.6 million for product returns and related
costs as a result of the re-rating. The provision was subsequently reduced by
approximately $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to
better than expected sell-through of the product and lower processing costs
related to product returns. The resulting impact on our consolidated results of
operations in fiscal 2005 was a reduction of $24.5 million,
$5.9 million, and $18.6 million for net revenues, cost of goods sold
and income from operations, respectively. At October 31, 2005, our
accounts receivable balance is net of reserves of approximately $7.7 million
for remaining product returns primarily related to our North American retail
inventory of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.


(3)

The Company reached a settlement and paid a $7.5 million
civil penalty to the SEC in fiscal 2005 related to certain accounting practices
that resulted in restatements of the Company’s financial statements as of and
for the years ended October 31, 2000 and 2002. Such penalties were accrued
and expensed as of October 31, 2004.

The following adjusts the Company’s statements

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in thousands, except per share
amounts)

This section and
other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also be
identified by words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “predicts,”
and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and our actual results may differ significantly from the results
discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such
differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection
entitled “Risk Factors” above. The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented
herein is based on our fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in
this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal years ended on October 31 and
the associated quarters of those fiscal years. We assume no obligation to
revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as
required by law.

The following information has been adjusted to reflect
the restatement of our financial results, which is more fully described in the “Explanatory
Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and in Note 2, “Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements” in Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Form 10-K. The net of tax impact of the
adjustments, which aggregated to $0.9 million in the first and second quarters
of 2006, was recorded by the Company in its third quarter of 2006. The impact
of these


adjustments was not significant to the Company’s
operating results, trends, or liquidity for the quarterly periods in 2006. The
net of tax impact of the restatements on the Company’s results of operations
amounted to $1.9 million and $3.3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

We have incurred material
expenses in 2006 as a direct result of the investigation into our stock option
grant practices and related accounting. These costs primarily relate to
professional services for legal, accounting and tax guidance. In addition, we
have incurred costs related to litigation, the informal investigation by the
SEC, the subpoenas from the District Attorney for the County of New York and
the preparation and review of our restated consolidated financial statements.
We expect that we will continue to incur costs associated with these matters.

Quarterly Impact of Stock Option Restatement

As a result of the
stock-based compensation restatement discussed above, we recorded additional
non-cash compensation expenses in our quarterly consolidated statements of
operations. The restatement of our 2005 quarterly results for stock-based
compensation did not impact our previously reported revenue or gross profit.
The additional compensation expense and related tax effects resulting from the
restatement did not significantly impact the trends in our operating results,
financial condition or liquidity discussed in our previously filed quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q. The impact of the restatement on our 2005
quarterly results is reflected in the “Quarterly Information” section of this
Item and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a leading global publisher, developer and
distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our
publishing segment, which consists of Rockstar Games, 2K Games, 2K Sports and
Global Star Software, develops, markets and publishes software titles for the
following leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms: Sony’s
PlayStation®2 and PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment systems; Sony’s PSP®
(PlayStation®Portable) system; Microsoft’s Xbox® and Xbox 360™ video game and
entertainment systems; Nintendo’s Wii™, GameCube™, DS™ and Game Boy® Advance;
and for PCs. Our distribution segment, which includes our Jack of All Games
subsidiary, distributes our products as well as third-party software, hardware
and accessories to retail outlets in North America.

Revenue in our publishing segment is primarily derived
from the sale of internally developed software titles, software titles
developed on our behalf by third parties and the sale of certain video game accessories
and peripherals. Operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in
part upon our ability to continually release new, commercially successful
products and to manage costs associated with business acquisitions and software
product development. We develop most of our frontline products internally, and
we own major intellectual properties, which we believe permits us to maximize
profitability. Operating margins for titles developed on our behalf by third
parties, or for which we do not own the intellectual property, are affected by
costs to acquire licenses and amounts due to developers.

Revenue in our distribution segment is derived from
the sale of third-party software titles, accessories and hardware. Operating
margins in our distribution business are dependent in part on the mix of
software and hardware sales, with software generating higher margins than
hardware. Publishing activities generate significantly higher margins than
distribution activities, with sales of PC software titles resulting in higher
margins than sales of products designed for video game consoles and handheld
platforms.

We have pursued a growth
strategy by capitalizing on the widespread market acceptance of interactive
entertainment, as well as the growing popularity of innovative action games
that appeal to the expanding demographics of video game players. We have
established a portfolio of successful proprietary software content for the
major hardware platforms. We expect Rockstar, the publisher of our

Grand Theft Auto

franchise, to continue to be a leader in
the action product category by leveraging our existing titles and


developing new brands. In
addition, we have diversified our product offerings by capitalizing on
significant growth opportunities in the market for sports and other action and
strategy titles. During 2005, we made several strategic acquisitions of sports
development studios and entered into license agreements with major sports
leagues to develop titles under our 2K Sports publishing label. We also entered
into license agreements for several popular entertainment properties, acquired
well-known intellectual property rights, and entered into distribution and
publishing arrangements for major action and strategy PC titles under our 2K
Games and Global Star Software publishing labels.

During the year ended October 31,
2006, based on information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, we
began reporting revenue and cost of goods sold by operating segment (publishing
and distribution). The Company has reclassified prior period financial
information to reflect this change and to conform to current year presentation.

2006 Financial Summary

The year ended October 31,
2006 was a transition year for our business. It can take up to three years for
us to develop and publish a major release such as those in our

Grand Theft Auto

franchise. Coming off the strong release of
our best-selling

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

title in October 2004, we turned our focus to developing our 2K Sports and
2K Games brands, sequels to our action games, and creating new action and
adventure titles. In addition, we began to make significant investments in
developing titles for next-generation gaming platforms such as the next title
in our

Grand Theft Auto

series, which we expect
to release in October 2007.

Our industry is cyclical
and our 2006 results were affected by the gaming industry’s transition to
next-generation hardware platforms. We believe that there was diminished demand
for gaming software on certain platforms in 2006 as a result of this transition
as game players postponed their purchases in anticipation of the release of
next-generation gaming systems. As this transition to next-generation hardware
progressed throughout 2006, we lowered prices on certain software titles to
match lower consumer demand for current generation software. We were also
affected by delays in next-generation hardware launch dates and reductions in
initial hardware launch quantities. In 2005, Sony introduced its PSP handheld
gaming system, followed by Microsoft’s release of the Xbox 360 in the first
quarter of our 2006 fiscal year. Sony introduced the PlayStation 3, and
Nintendo launched its Wii console in November 2006 (the beginning of our
2007 fiscal year). We had initially expected Sony to release its PlayStation 3
platform near the middle of our 2006 fiscal year. Additionally, Sony released
lower launch quantities of the PlayStation 3 in North America than originally
expected and postponed the European launch of the system into 2007.

We took
measures to respond to the difficult industry and business environment in 2006
by reviewing our product pipeline and the financial position of our
subsidiaries. As a result, we incurred non-cash charges of approximately $28.3
million to write-off several software titles that were in development, fixed
assets, certain trademarks and acquired intangible assets of which
$21.1 million were due to underperforming development studios. We also
reduced headcount by 194 employees and recorded severance and other charges of
$5.3 million in connection with our studio closures. In addition, we incurred
the following charges in 2006:

·

We
recorded non-cash charges at our Joytech subsidiary for impairment of goodwill
and fixed assets totaling $6.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Joytech
is a manufacturer of video game accessories and peripherals and is reported as
a component of our publishing segment.

·

We
incurred approximately $2.3 million of expenses during the third and fourth
quarters of 2006 in connection with the relocation of our international
publishing headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland as part of a restructuring of
our international publishing operations.

Our net loss for the year
ended October 31, 2006 also includes the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R),
which required us to begin expensing employee stock options beginning on November 1,
2005. As a result, we


recorded $12.1 million of
stock-based compensation expense related to stock options in our statement of
operations for the year ended October 31, 2006. In addition, we recorded a $63.5 million valuation allowance in
2006, which increased our net loss by approximately $0.89 per share.

Business Acquisitions

During
the three years ended October 31, 2006, we completed nine acquisitions,
reflecting our efforts to diversify our business by adding seasoned development
studios, intellectual property, talented personnel and other resources to our
existing infrastructure. The purchase method of accounting requires business
combinations to be included in our consolidated financial statements from their
acquisition dates forward. Although none of the following acquisitions had a
significant effect on our results of operations during each of the three years
ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, they do affect the comparability of
our results from period to period. Information about the acquired businesses as

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We
base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current
trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time
our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis,
management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and
judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in
accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot
be determined with certainty, actual amounts could differ significantly from
these estimates.

We have identified the
policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of
our financial results and they require management’s most difficult, subjective
or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The impact and any associated
risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed
throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial
results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other
accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates
and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.


Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue upon
the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We apply the provisions
of Statement of Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition” in
conjunction with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,
“Revenue Recognition.” Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software when
there is (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer
exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the product is
delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection
of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with
customers typically provide net 30 and 60-day terms.

Some of our software
products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the
consumer. Currently, none of our products require an internet connection for
use, and online functionality is perceived to be of only incidental value to
the software product itself. When such functionality is offered to the
consumer, we do not provide ongoing technical support for gameplay. Accordingly,
we consider such features to be insignificant deliverables and do not defer
revenue related to products containing online features.

Revenue is recognized
after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions. In
specific circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns
and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of receivables
is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate
any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the
receivables is probable. Advances received for software development are
reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue.

Allowances for
Returns and Price Concessions

We accept returns and
grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements.
Following reductions in the price of our products, we grant price concessions
to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to
merchandise unsold by them. Our customers must satisfy certain conditions to
entitle them to return products or receive price concessions, including
compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory
levels.

Our distribution
arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to
cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution
customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers, which
includes credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below
expectations.

We make estimates of
future product returns and price concessions related to current period product
revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for
published titles based upon, among other factors, historical experience and
performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of the
hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of sell-through rates,
sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions
and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers.

Significant management
judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing
the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We
believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions.
However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of
changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments to
estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Software Development
Costs

We utilize both internal
development teams and third-party software developers to develop the titles we
publish.


We capitalize internal
software development costs (including stock-based compensation, specifically
identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related
to the completion and release of titles), third-party production and other content
costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software
title. Amortization of such capitalized costs is recorded on a title-by-title
basis in cost of goods sold (software development costs) using (1) the
proportion of current year net revenues to the total net revenues expected to
be recorded over the life of the title or (2) the straight-line method
over the remaining estimated useful life of the title, whichever is greater.

We have established an
internal royalty program that allows certain of our employees to participate in
the success of software titles that they assist in developing. Royalties earned
by employees under this program are recorded to cost of goods sold (royalties)
as they are incurred.

We frequently enter into
agreements with third-party developers that require us to make advance payments
for game development and production services. In exchange for our advance
payments, we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the
finished game title as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual
property rights. Such agreements allow us to recover the advance payments to
the developers at an agreed royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales
of such software, net of any agreed costs. We capitalize advance payments as
software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility
of a software title and amortize them, on a title-by-title basis, as royalties
in cost of goods sold. Royalty amortization is recorded using (1) the proportion
of current year net revenues to the total net revenues expected to be recorded
over the life of the title or (2) the contractual, net revenue based
royalty rate defined in the respective agreement, whichever is greater. At each
balance sheet date, we evaluate the recoverability of advanced development
payments and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that have not been
paid. To the extent that advance payments are deemed unrecoverable, they are
charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is
made.

In certain circumstances,
management determines that it is prudent to cancel a development project. At
the time such a decision is made, we expense the related capitalized software
development costs. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate the recoverability
of capitalized software costs using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis,
and charge any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable to cost of goods sold. We
use various measures to estimate future net revenues for our software titles,
including past performance of similar titles and orders for titles prior to
their release. For sequels, the performance of predecessor titles is also taken
into consideration.

Licenses

Licenses consist of
payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use
of their trademarks, copyrights, technology or other intellectual property
rights in the development of our products. Agreements with rights holders
generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their
intellectual property. Guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an
asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) upon execution of a
licensing agreement, provided that no significant performance remains with the
licensor. When significant performance remains with the licensor, we record
payments when actually paid.

Certain licenses,
especially those related to our sports products, extend over multi-year periods
and encompass multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments,
these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay
royalties to the license holder based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds.

Capitalized licensing fees
are amortized as royalties in cost of goods sold on a title-by-title basis at a
ratio of (1) current period net revenues to the total net revenues
expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or (2) the
contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the
licensing


agreement, whichever is
greater. Similar to software development costs, we review our sales projections
quarterly to determine the likely recoverability of our capitalized licenses as
well as any unpaid minimum obligations. When management determines that the
value of a license is unlikely to be recovered by product sales, capitalized
licenses are charged to cost of goods sold, based on current and expected net
revenues, in the period in which such determination is made. Criteria used to
evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales for a title
include: historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior
to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the
performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Asset Impairment

Business Combinations -
Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The purchase
method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be
recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our
consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired
business from the completion date of an acquisition. The costs to acquire a
business, including transaction, integration and restructuring costs, are
allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition. Any excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

We evaluate our goodwill
annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment
exist. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired
involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the
approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. We generally use
either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such
fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an
asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life
of the asset, discounted to present value. The cost approach presumes that an
investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction
cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in
the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation
approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately
selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of
information. Changes in our strategy and/or market conditions could
significantly impact these judgments and require reductions to recorded
intangible asset balances.

We recorded a pre-tax
goodwill impairment charge of approximately $6.4 million in our publishing
segment for the year ended October 31, 2006. The impairment was related to
our Joytech subsidiary, a manufacturer of video game accessories and
peripherals. At October 31, 2006, the fair value of our other reporting
units exceeded the carrying amounts and no impairment was indicated.

Long-lived assets.

We
review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires
various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are
directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which
cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset’s residual value, if any. In
turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value,
which is based on the best information available. We use internal discounted
cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent
appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. We derive the required
cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business
plans and apply an appropriate discount rate.

In response to the
difficult industry environment in 2006, we evaluated our businesses, reduced
costs and closed our underperforming development studios, which resulted in
certain fixed asset abandonment and write-off of capitalized software costs,
certain intangibles and other assets. In total, we recorded non-cash


charges of $30.0 million
($20.7 million as a component of cost of goods sold), primarily in the second
and third quarters of 2006.

Stock-based
Compensation

We account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. Under the fair value
recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation expense is
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of
share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected
stock volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the
amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual
results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation
expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

Prior to November 1,
2005, we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”). Under APB 25,
generally, no compensation expense was recognized in connection with the
awarding of stock option grants to employees provided that, as of the grant
date, all terms associated with the award are fixed and the quoted market price
of the stock is equal to or less than the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock as defined. For fixed awards, compensation expense was
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our common stock
at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted.
Compensation expense for fixed awards was recognized ratably over the vesting
period on a straight-line basis.

As a result of the review
of the Special Committee, it was determined that the original grant dates
reported in our records for a substantial number of stock option awards during
the periods between April 1997 through August 2003 were not the
proper measurement dates for accounting purposes. As a result of the Special
Committee investigation, we have recorded a pre-tax non-cash cumulative charge
of $54.6 million ($42.1 million on an after-tax basis) in our consolidated
financial statements through October 31, 2005 to reflect additional
stock-based compensation costs. Significant judgment was applied in determining
measurement dates for many of our stock option awards. Information regarding
the restatement, including ranges of compensation expense if other measurement
dates has been selected for certain grants, is set forth in  the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I,
Item 1 and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

GAAP requires that we
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount
that is more likely than not to be realized. Our cumulative U.S. pre-tax loss
in the three most recent fiscal years represents sufficient negative evidence
for us to determine that the establishment of a full valuation allowance
against the deferred tax asset is appropriate. This valuation allowance offsets
deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as
carryforward items. Although management expects that these assets will
ultimately be utilized, future realization cannot be assured.

Our future effective tax rates could be adversely
affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have
lower statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or
liabilities, or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition,
our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue
Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of
our provision for income taxes.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”), which clarifies the
definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair
value measurement. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements
and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements. SFAS 157 will be effective for the Company on November 1,
2008. We are currently assessing whether the adoption of SFAS 157 will have an
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In September 2006,
the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides
interpretive guidance on the SEC’s views on how the effects of the carryover or
reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a
current year misstatement. The provisions of SAB 108 will be effective for the
Company on November 1, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of applying SAB 108 but does not believe that the application of SAB 108
will have a material effect on its financial position, cash flows, or results
of operations.

In June 2006, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109

(“FIN 48”),
to create a single model to address the accounting for uncertainty in tax
positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will be effective for
the Company beginning November 1, 2007. The cumulative-effect of adopting
FIN 48 will be recorded to opening retained earnings. Management is currently
evaluating the effect, if any, that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Fluctuations in Operating Results and Seasonality

We have experienced
fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the
timing of the introduction of new titles; variations in sales of titles
developed for particular platforms; market acceptance of our titles;
development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new
titles; sequels or enhancements of existing titles; projected and actual
changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our
competitors; product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our
competitors; the size and timing of acquisitions; the timing of orders from
major customers; order cancellations; and delays in product shipment. Sales of
our titles are also seasonal, with peak shipments typically occurring in the
fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters) as a result of
increased demand for titles during the holiday season. Quarterly and annual
comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future
operating results.

N

et revenue for the
year ended October 31, 2006 decreased compared to the prior year, which
included strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

, our most popular product to date.

Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas

was released in October 2004 for PlayStation
2 and in June 2005 for Xbox and PC, and accounted for more than 25% of our
total revenue in 2005. In 2006, we also experienced declines in net revenue due
to weaker industry conditions, resulting largely from the transition to
next-generation hardware platforms and the associated decrease in demand for
current generation video games. Consumers often delay their software purchases
in anticipation of next-generation platform launches and as a result, we
reduced prices on some of our current generation software titles to meet
diminishing demand throughout 2006. Similarly, the transition to
next-generation consoles also negatively impacted the net revenue in our
distribution segment. Publishing revenue for the year ended October 31,
2006 and 2005 includes licensing revenue of $10.9 million and $17.8 million,
respectively.

We continue to derive the majority of our revenue from
software that is created for video game console platforms, which accounted for 60.2%
of publishing revenue in 2006 compared to 78.5% for the comparable 2005 period.
Although some industry analysts expect PC product sales to remain flat over the
next few years, we believe we have the ability to publish commercially
successful PC titles, as we did with

The
Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

and

Sid Meier’s Civilization IV

in 2006,
and expect these products to continue to contribute significantly to our net
revenue. However, we expect our revenue mix to continue to favor game consoles,
especially as they become more functional and interactive entertainment
platforms. Handheld gaming platforms have also contributed significantly to our
revenue, due mostly to the success of our

Grand Theft Auto

brand titles for the PSP.

Our distribution revenue is derived from the sale of
third-party software titles, hardware and accessories. The decrease in
distribution revenue in 2006 reflects increased competition and a decline in
the sales volume and average selling prices of value and front-line software
titles as our industry transitioned to next-generation platforms. The decline
in sales of software titles was partially offset by an increase in hardware
sales and peripherals, largely due to the launch of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 in the
first quarter of our 2006 fiscal year.

Operations outside of North America accounted for
approximately 31.3% and 31.9% of our net revenue in the years ended October 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we recognized lower publishing revenue in
Europe, reflecting the comparison to the 2005 period which had significant
sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

.
International revenue for the year ended October 31, 2006 primarily
consisted of sales of

Grand Theft Auto:
Liberty City Stories

for PSP and PlayStation 2,

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

for Xbox
360 and PC,

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

on multiple platforms,

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories

on
PSP and

Prey

for Xbox 360 and PC.

Foreign currency exchange
rates increased net revenue by approximately $1.3 million in 2006. We expect
international revenue to continue to account for a significant portion of our
revenue.

Product costs.

The
decrease in our product costs is consistent with the lower revenue levels in
both our publishing and distribution segments. However, product costs became a
greater percentage of total net revenue in 2006 due to a change in sales mix at
our distribution segment toward hardware products and peripherals, such as the
Xbox 360, which have higher product costs than software titles. We lowered
prices and earned lower margins on some of our current generation software
titles, and continued to shift our focus to developing for next-generation
gaming platforms, which also contributed to the increase in product costs as a
percentage of net revenue in the year ended October 31, 2006.

Royalties.

We
continued to see the average cost of game development increase in 2006, a trend
that we expect to persist as next-generation platforms allow for more elaborate
gameplay experiences such as high-definition display. Royalties as a percentage
of net revenue increased in 2006 due to higher external royalty costs related
to sales of externally developed software titles, particularly

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

, and higher licensing costs. In
addition, royalty expense in 2006 reflects the first full year of our
long-term, third-party exclusive licensing relationships with Major League
Baseball Properties and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Lower
royalty expense recorded in connection with our internally developed products,
which totaled $40.4 million in 2006 compared to $83.8 million in 2005,
partially offset the increase in external royalties.

Software
development costs.

In
connection with our industry’s transition to next-generation consoles in 2006,
we evaluated the sales expectations of our internal development studios as well
as overall industry conditions and, as part of a cost savings initiative,
decided to close three development studios and discontinue the further
development of certain software titles. As a result, we recorded an impairment
charge of $20.7 million in our publishing segment to write-off certain product,
royalty and software development costs related to game titles that we no longer
intended to bring to market and therefore would not recover their capitalized
value. The impairment charge also caused software development costs to increase
as a percent of net revenue versus the prior year.

Compared to the prior year, we sold a larger number of
internally developed software titles in 2006, resulting in higher amortization
of capitalized costs compared to the prior period. Software development costs
primarily related to sales of internally developed sports and other titles such
as

Grand
Theft Auto: Vice City Stories,

The Warriors,

Rockstar
Games Presents Table Tennis

,

Amped
3, Major League Baseball 2K6, NBA 2K6, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix

,

Top
Spin 2

and

Bully

in
2006. In the comparable 2005 period, software development costs were
primarily attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

,

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition,
Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

and

The Warriors

.

In future periods, cost of
goods sold may be adversely affected by manufacturing and other costs, price
competition and by changes in product and sales mix, distribution channels and
royalty arrangements.

Selling and
marketing.

We
maintained a consistent level of selling and marketing expense as a
percentage of net revenue in 2006 by decreasing overall spending compared to
the prior year, which contained substantial marketing and promotion of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

. We also spent less on in-store promotional
advertising and reduced our presence at E3, an annual industry trade exhibition
that was held in May 2006. The decrease was also due to lower personnel
expenses, primarily resulting from a reduction in incentive compensation,
consistent with current business performance. Partially offsetting our decrease
in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended October 31, 2006 were
increases in advertising and promotion of our 2K Sports games, particularly

Major
League Baseball 2K6

.

General and administrative.

General and administrative
expense increased in 2006, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs,
which includes approximately $6.9 million of expense related to the adoption of
SFAS 123(R) on November 1, 2005.  We also incurred incremental severance costs
in the second and third quarters of 2006 in connection with our cost savings
plans, which included studio closures. The increase in personnel costs was
partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation, consistent with our
lower revenue and business performance in the 2006 year.

Operating expenses in 2006 reflect a full year of
general and administrative expenses related to our 2005 acquisitions, resulting
in additional occupancy and related expenses compared to the prior year period.
In addition, as a result of various ongoing legal matters, including a review
of our stock option grants and process improvement projects, we incurred an
incremental $4.6 million in professional fees in the 2006 period. General and
administrative expenses also increased for lease termination fees incurred in
connection with the closure of development studios and costs for information
technology system improvements, offset by a reduction in consulting fees
related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.  General and administrative expenses for the
year ended October 31, 2006 and 2005 also include occupancy expenses
(primarily rent, utilities and office expenses) of $15.2 million and $9.0
million, respectively, related to our development studios.

Research and
development.

The decrease in research and
development expense was primarily attributable to studio closures and lower
personnel costs, which decreased by approximately $7.2 million. Lower incentive
compensation in 2006, consistent with current business performance, and greater
percentage of salary and related costs for our software development personnel
being capitalized, resulted in lower compensation expense than in the prior
period. In addition, we recorded less incentive compensation in 2006,
consistent with current business performance. Production expenses also
decreased in the current year as more of our titles reached the technological
feasibility stage of development. Employee severance costs incurred in
connection with the closure of development studios and a full year of expenses
related to our 2005 business acquisitions offset our decrease in research and
development in the current period.


A substantial portion of our development costs are
capitalized once software development projects reach technological feasibility,
which is relatively early in the development process. Such costs are
subsequently amortized as cost of goods sold commencing with the release of the
title. Amounts earned under our internal royalty program, which are based on
product sales, are expensed as incurred in cost of goods sold. During 2006,
$8.1 million of equity compensation recorded in connection with SFAS 123(R),
which is directly related to the completion and release of our titles, has been
capitalized as software development costs. Such costs are amortized as cost of
goods sold upon release of the title.

Impairment,
depreciation and amortization.

We recorded
impairment charges of approximately $15.6 million in 2006, related to the
write-off of goodwill and fixed assets at our Joytech subsidiary as well as
other intangibles. The impairment charges were based on management’s assessment
of the future value of these assets including future business prospects and
estimated cash flows to be derived from these assets.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in
2006 as we upgraded and improved software systems and recorded a full year of
expense related to the fixed assets and leasehold improvements acquired in
connection with our development studio purchases in  2005 and 2006.

Provision (benefit)
for income taxes.

Income tax expense was
$0.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2006 compared to $6.4 million
for the year ended October 31, 2005. The income tax expense recorded
against our net loss in 2006 was primarily a result of a $63.5 million increase
in our valuation allowance that was recorded in accordance with SFAS 109 to
reduce our deferred tax assets, which increased our net loss by approximately
$0.89 per share. The valuation allowance was primarily recorded due to
uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to
our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the significant adjustment
to our valuation allowance during 2006, our effective tax rate was 0.2% for the
full year period, compared to 15.4% in the prior year, which was impacted by
additional reserves recorded for product returns primarily related to our North
American retail inventory of

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

.

We adopted SFAS 123(R) on November 1, 2005,
which requires, among other items, the recognition of stock option expense in
the results of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the
income tax effects of compensatory stock options are included in the
computation of the income tax expense (benefit), and deferred tax assets and
liabilities, subject to certain prospective adjustments to stockholders’ equity
for the differences between the income tax effects of expenses recognized in
the results of operations and the related amounts deducted for income tax
purposes. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123(R), the tax benefits relating to
the income tax deductions for compensatory stock options were recorded directly
to stockholders’ equity.

We are regularly audited by domestic and foreign
taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts
claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax positions
comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for
reasonably foreseeable tax assessments.

Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.

For
the year ended October 31, 2006, net loss was $184.9 million, or $2.60 per
share, compared to net income of $35.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share, for
the year ended October 31, 2005, resulting from the changes referred to
above and a higher number of weighted average shares outstanding, which
reflects shares issued in connection with stock-based compensation arrangements
and business acquisitions. The review of stock option granting practices
performed by us and the Special Committee resulted in a $1.3 million reduction
in net income or $0.02 per diluted share in 2006, compared to a reduction in
net income of $1.9 million or $0.03 per diluted share in 2005.


Years Ended October 31,
2005 and 2004

Net Revenue

The increase in net revenue was attributable to growth
in our publishing business. Publishing net revenue was led by strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Midnight Club 3: DUB
Edition

and

The Warriors

on
multiple platforms and

Grand Theft Auto:
Liberty City Stories

for the PSP. Sales of

Sid Meier’s Civilization IV

and

Stronghold


for PC and our sports titles for the PlayStation 2 and
Xbox, including

Major League Baseball 2K5

,
also contributed to the increase in publishing revenue. Publishing net revenue
in 2004 primarily reflects sales of

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2, which was released in
October 2004, and

Grand Theft Auto
Double Pack

and

Max Payne 2: The
Fall of Max Payne

for Xbox and the PlayStation 2. Publishing revenue
in 2005 and 2004 includes licensing revenue of $17.8 million and $20.1 million,
respectively.

Sales of our

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

title in North America during 2005 were
negatively impacted by product returns due to the re-rating of this title. In July 2005,
a provision of $32.6 million was recorded for product returns and related costs
as a result of the re-rating. The provision was subsequently reduced by
approximately $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to better
than expected sell-through of the product and lower processing costs related to
product returns. At October 31, 2005, our accounts receivable balance is
net of reserves of approximately $7.7 million for remaining product returns
primarily related to our North American retail inventory of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

Products designed for video game console platforms
accounted for 78.5% of 2005 publishing revenue as compared to 93.1% for 2004.
Products designed for PC platforms accounted for 11.5% of 2005 publishing
revenue as compared to 2.7% for 2004. The increase in net revenue of products
for PC platforms as a percentage of publishing revenue was primarily
attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto:
San Andreas, Sid Meier’s Civilization IV

and

Stronghold 2

for PC. We anticipate that
our platform mix will continue to be heavily weighted toward console platforms
and the PSP handheld system, but may fluctuate from period to period.

The decrease in distribution revenue was primarily
attributable to lower sales volume of software titles, a decrease in average
selling prices of interactive entertainment products as our industry
transitioned to next-generation hardware platforms and increased competition in
the value software market. The decline in sales of software titles was
partially offset by an increase in hardware sales, primarily attributable to
demand for the Sony PSP system and related accessories.

International operations accounted for approximately
$385.0 million, or 31.9% of net revenue for 2005 compared to $310.4 million or
27.5% of net revenue for 2004. The increase was primarily attributable to sales
of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for
the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC, sales of

Midnight
Club 3: DUB Edition

for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PSP, sales of

The Warriors

for the PlayStation 2 and
Xbox, and sales of

Sid Meier’s Civilization
IV

and

Stronghold 2

for
PC. International revenue for 2004 was primarily attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the
PlayStation 2, which was released in October 2004, various

Grand Theft Auto

titles,

Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne

and

Red Dead Revolver.


In 2005 and 2004, net
revenue included approximately $23.6 million and $35.8 million, respectively,
of benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates. We expect international net
revenue to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue.

Product costs.

The
decrease in product costs occurred mainly in our distribution segment, where
the mix of products changed from higher cost items such as gaming consoles, to
lower cost products, such as software titles. The decrease in product costs was
also due to the increase in net revenue of publishing PC products which have
lower costs than console based software products. As a result of our product
mix shifting to software sales in the 2005 period, the gross margin in our
distribution segment increased to 9.4% in 2005 from 7.0% in 2004.

Royalties.

The increase in royalties was
primarily attributable to expense associated with

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

under our internal Rockstar
royalty program, which provides for increasing royalty levels as product net
revenue increases. Royalties also increased as a result of internal royalty
expense associated with sales of

Midnight
Club 3: DUB Edition, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, The Warriors

and external royalty expense associated with our sports titles, including

Major League Baseball 2K5.

Aggregate
internal royalty expense, excluding employer payroll taxes, for 2005 and 2004
amounted to $83.8 million and $45.9 million, respectively.

Software development costs.

The increase in software
development costs was due to the increased sales of our internally developed
titles, including

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition,

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

and

The Warriors

resulting in
higher amortization of capitalized costs as compared to 2004.

In future periods, cost of
goods sold may be adversely affected by higher manufacturing and other costs,
price competition and by changes in product, sales mix, distribution channels
and royalty arrangements.

Selling and
marketing.

The increase in selling and
marketing expense was primarily due to higher advertising and promotional
spending, which increased by $28.9 million to $101.1 million in 2005. The
additional spending was for new and existing products, including

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, The Warriors

and

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

across multiple platforms,

Grand Theft Auto:
Liberty City Stories

for the PSP and to promote our various titles
under our new 2K publishing labels. In addition, the increase was due to higher
personnel expense of approximately $5.5 million, which is consistent with the
growth of our business, and to additional expenditures related to our increased
presence at E3, an industry trade exhibition, held in May each year. The
stock option review performed by us
and the Special Committee


resulted in $0.3 million
and $1.7 million of additional stock-based compensation expense, recorded as a
component of selling and marketing expenses, for the years ended October 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

General and
administrative.

The increase in general and
administrative expense was primarily due to an increase of approximately $15.4
million in professional fees related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, legal
matters and process improvement and an increase of approximately $5.6 million
in compensation and related costs for additional personnel to support the
growth of our business. In addition, rental and office expenses increased
approximately $5.0 million due to recently acquired development studios and the
opening of a new office for our 2K publishing labels in 2005. The increase was
partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense from the prior comparable
period. During 2004, personnel expenses included $3.4 million of severance
charges, signing bonuses and restricted stock expenses, primarily attributable
to senior management changes and additional rent expense associated with
relocating a European office. The stock option review performed by the Special Committee resulted in $0.7 million and
$2.7 million of additional stock-based compensation expense, recorded as a
component of general and administrative, for the years ended October 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Research and
development.

The increase in research and
development costs was primarily due to increased personnel and related expenses
of approximately $25.8 million associated with development studios that were
acquired during 2005. Increased personnel expenses are attributable to higher
staffing levels, reflecting our strategy of bringing more of our development
in-house. A substantial portion of our research and development costs are
capitalized once software development projects reach technological feasibility,
which is relatively early in the development process. They are subsequently
amortized as cost of goods sold.
Research and development expense includes $0.6 and $0.5 million of additional
stock-based compensation expense resulting from the stock option review
performed by the Special Committee for the years ended October 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Depreciation and
amortization.

Depreciation and amortization
expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation related to the upgrading
of software systems, our new office and warehouse facility for our Jack of All
Games subsidiary, additional leasehold improvements related to development
studios acquired in 2005 and the addition of new offices for our 2K publishing
labels.

Provision for
income taxes.

Income tax expense was $6.4
million for 2005 as compared to $29.6 million for 2004. The decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in taxable income and a reduction in the
annual effective tax rate. The annual effective tax rate was 15.4% for 2005, as
compared to 32.3% for 2004. The lower annual effective tax rate is primarily
due to a change in the mix of earnings with a greater proportion of income
being generated in lower tax jurisdictions (13.6% decrease to the effective tax
rate) and a loss being generated in a higher tax jurisdiction. The lower annual
effective tax rate in 2005 was also due to a higher extraterritorial income tax
benefit (“ETI”) (6.5% decrease to the effective tax rate). The 2004 tax
provision included benefits from a change in the mix of earnings with a greater
proportion of income from lower tax jurisdictions (4.1% decrease to the
effective tax rate) and from ETI (4.2% decrease to the effective tax rate)
partially offset by the non-deductibility of the payment of a $7.5 million
civil penalty in connection with an SEC settlement (2.8% increase to the
effective rate).

At October 31, 2005, we had capital loss
carryforwards totaling approximately $26.8 million that will expire in the
periods 2006 through 2008. Management does not expect to generate sufficient
taxable income from capital transactions prior to the expiration of these
benefits, and accordingly a valuation allowance was recorded in 2003 for this
asset as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to
these carryforwards will not be realized. At October 31, 2005, we had
foreign net operating losses of approximately $10.0 million expiring between
2006 and 2010, and state net operating losses of approximately $93.0 million
expiring between 2011 and 2026. Management does not expect to generate
sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in future
years to fully utilize the net operating losses before expiration. Accordingly,
valuation allowances have been recorded for these assets in the amount of $3.4 million
and $6.0 million, respectively.


We are regularly audited by domestic and foreign
taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts
claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax positions
comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for
reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. We believe that any assessments in
excess of the amounts provided for will not have a material adverse impact on
the consolidated financial statements.

Net income and net
income per share.

Net income was $35.3
million for 2005 or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $62.1 million or $0.91
per diluted share for 2004, resulting from the changes referred to above. The
review of stock options granting practices performed by the Special Committee
resulted in a $1.9 million reduction of net income in 2005 or $0.03 per diluted
share, compared to $3.3 million or $0.05 per share in 2004.

The impact of the restatement adjustment of
$0.9 million on our 2006 statements of operations was recorded in the
third quarter of fiscal year 2006 due to its immateriality, and therefore our
previously reported first and second quarter 2006 statements of operations have
not been restated.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed
independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of
quarterly basic and diluted earnings per share information may not equal annual
basic and diluted earnings per share.


The
following table sets forth our statements of operations for each of the

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements have been to fund (i) the
development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products (ii) working
capital (iii) acquisitions and (iv) capital expenditures.
Historically, we have relied on funds provided by operating activities and
short and long-term borrowings to satisfy our working capital needs.

As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, amounts due from
our five largest customers comprised approximately 45.4% and 42.7% of our gross
accounts receivable balance, respectively, with our significant customers
(those that individually comprise more than 10% of our gross accounts
receivable balance) accounting for 36.4% and 16.0% of such balance at October 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. We believe that the receivable balances from these
largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past
collection experience.

Generally, we have been able to collect our accounts
receivable in the ordinary course of business. We do not hold any collateral to
secure payment from customers and our receivables are generally not covered by
insurance. However, from time to time we purchase insurance from financial
institutions on our accounts receivable, with certain limits, to help protect
us from loss in the event of a customer’s bankruptcy or insolvency.

We are subject to credit risks, particularly in the
event that any of the receivables represent a limited number of retailers or
are concentrated in foreign markets. If we are unable to collect our accounts
receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and
working capital position and we would be required to increase our provision for
doubtful accounts.

We have entered
into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require
substantial cash commitments over the next several years. Generally, these
include:

·

Agreements
to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights and
technology for use in the publishing, marketing and distribution of our
software titles. Our licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect
agreements with major sports leagues and players’ associations and expire at
various times through December 2012;

·

Contractual
advances and royalty payments to third-party software developers that expire at
various times through November 2008. Guaranteed minimum payments assume
satisfactory performance;

·

Operating
leases, primarily related to occupancy, furniture and equipment, expiring at
various times through July 2015; and

·

Distribution
agreements to purchase third-party software games that require guaranteed
minimum payments through July 2008.

A summary of annual minimum contractual obligations
and commitments as of October 31, 2006 is as follows (in thousands of
dollars):

In addition to the cash commitments above, we have
also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for contingent
cash consideration subject to certain acquired companies achieving agreed-upon
financial or unit sales goals. The amount and timing of these payments are currently
not fixed or determinable. See the “Business Acquisitions” section of this Item
and Note 3 to the financial statements for a full discussion of our potential
acquisition commitments.

We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents
and projected cash flow from operations will provide us with sufficient
liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital, capital
expenditures and commitments through at least the next twelve months. If our
projected cash flow and available cash is insufficient to fund our operations,
or if our plans and assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate, we may be
required to seek additional financing.

Our
cash and cash equivalents increased by $25.3 million for the year ended October 31,
2006 as follows:

$(28,382

)

Our increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2006 was
mainly a result of operating activities. Contributing to our net loss for the
year ended October 31, 2006, were $264.4 million of non-cash expenses. In
addition, we received cash advances for future online content creation, in-game
advertising and licensing of our intellectual property in 2006, reflected in
our $50.0 million increase in deferred revenue. Excluding the increase in
deferred revenue, our net cash provided by operating activities and financial
position reflects a transition from the exceptionally strong business environment
in 2005, which included strong sales of our

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

title, to our focus in 2006 on developing new titles in that
series and for next-generation gaming systems. The $37.9 million reduction in
our accounts receivable balance reflects collections on the strong sales of
2005, particularly in the first quarter of 2006. The effects of the console
transition were also apparent in our distribution business where inventory was
added at a much slower pace and at lower unit values than in the prior year. Reducing
the cash generated by operating activities were increased capitalized software
development costs and significantly higher professional fees, primarily those
associated with our legal proceedings and the investigation into our stock
option granting practices. Overall working capital decreased $84.6 million in
2006.

C

ash used for
investing activities in 2006 primarily reflects purchases of computer equipment
and network infrastructure as well as leasehold improvements. We moved our European
headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland in the third quarter of 2006, which
resulted in incremental capital expenditures. We also made cash payments of
$1.3 million for prior year acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities was
partially offset by $1.1 million of net cash acquired in connection with our
Firaxis acquisition.

Cash provided by financing
activities reflects the exercise of employee stock options and their related
tax benefit in the current year, both of which decreased substantially from the
prior year as a result of a lower average stock price in 2006.

International
Operations

Net revenue in
international markets, principally in the United Kingdom and continental
Europe, has accounted for a significant portion of our total net revenue. For
2006 and 2005, approximately 39.4% and 39.8%, respectively, of our net revenue
was earned outside of the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in
foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties,
fluctuations in foreign


currency exchange rates,
shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic
developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating
results.

Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course
of our business, primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations. Historically, fluctuations in interest rates have not
had a significant impact on our operating results. At October 31, 2006, we
had no outstanding variable rate indebtedness.

We transact business in
foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. Accounts relating to foreign operations are
translated into United States dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the
relevant fiscal quarter or year end. Translation adjustments are included as a
separate component of stockholders’ equity. For 2006, our foreign currency
translation adjustment loss was $6.2 million and our foreign exchange
transaction gain was $2.2 million.

Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements
and supplementary data appear in a separate section of this report following Part III.
We provide details of our valuation and qualifying accounts in Note 16 “Supplementary
Financial Information” to the consolidated financial statements. All schedules
have been omitted since the information required to be submitted has been
included on the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto or has been
omitted as not applicable or not required.

Item 9. Changes in
and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Upon the approval of the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, on April 4, 2006, the Company dismissed
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PWC”) as the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm.

During the Company’s fiscal years ended October 31,
2005 and 2004 and through April 4, 2006 there were no disagreements with
PWC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of PWC, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on the financial
statements for such years. PWC’s reports on the Company’s financial statements
for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 did not contain an
adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During the Company’s fiscal years ended October 31,
2005 and 2004 and through April 4, 2006, there have been no reportable
events as set forth in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K except as
follows:

As
more fully disclosed in Item 9A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, the Company had identified the
following material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of October 31, 2005:

·

The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the existence and valuation of
its accounts payable related to inventory purchases. Specifically, the Company
did not maintain effective controls to identify, analyze and reconcile amounts
related to inventory purchases included in accounts payable to underlying
supporting documentation.

·

The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy of the
amortization of its capitalized software development costs. Specifically, the
Company did not have effective controls to accurately prepare and review inputs
to a spreadsheet application used to calculate amortization expense related to
capitalized software development costs.


On April 4, 2006 the
Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Ernst &
Young LLP (“E&Y”) as the Company’s new independent registered public
accounting firm to audit the Company’s financial statements. During the Company’s
two most recent fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 and through April 4,
2006, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with E&Y
regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a
specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit
opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements, and
neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company by E&Y
that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision
as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any
matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item
304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a
reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

Item 9A. Controls
and Procedures

Special
Committee Review into Stock Option Grant Practices and Restatement

As discussed in the Explanatory Note preceding Part I
and in Note 2 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K,
the Company on January 17, 2007, announced that an internal review of its
stock option grant practices conducted by the Special Committee and the
Investigative Team had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of
certain past stock option grants. As a result of the internal review and the
independent investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for
financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior
periods. Therefore, the Company has recorded additional non-cash stock-based
compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option
grants, and the Company is restating previously filed financial statements in
this Form 10-K.

The internal review
and the Special Committee’s independent investigation identified a number of
occasions between April 1997 and August 2003 (the “relevant period”)
when the Company used incorrect measurement dates for stock option grants. The
independent investigation also found that during the relevant period:

·

Procedures for granting,
accounting, and reporting of stock option grants did not include sufficient
safeguards to prevent manipulation;

·

The grant dates for a number
of grants were intentionally selected in order to obtain favorable exercise
prices;

·

The Company’s former
Chairman/CEO engaged in conduct that raises serious concerns in connection with
the granting, accounting, recording, and reporting of stock options.

In its 2004 fiscal
year, the Company began implementing improvements to procedures, processes, and
systems to provide additional safeguards and greater internal control over the
stock option granting and administration function in compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and evolving accounting guidance.  These improvements included:

·

Documenting and assessing
the design and operation of internal controls;

·

Segregating
responsibilities, adding reviews and reconciliations, and redefining roles and
responsibilities;

·

Upgrading systems and
system controls that support the processes;

·

Training in the stock
administration function;


·

Implementing, before the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the practice of using the receipt of the
final Board or Compensation Committee approval as the grant and measurement
date for stock option grants; and

·

Identifying key controls,
developing test plans, and testing controls in the stock granting and
administration function.

In evaluating the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures and the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2006, management considered, among other things, the impact of the restatement
to the financial statements and the effectiveness of the internal controls in this
area as of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. Management has
concluded that control deficiencies resulting in the restatement of previously
issued financial statements did not constitute a material weakness in
disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls over financial
reporting, as of October 31, 2006.

In addition to the
improvements discussed above, the Company may adopt other measures identified
by the Special Committee and management in 2007 to enhance the oversight of the
stock option granting and administration function and the review and
preparation of financial statements.

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation
under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management,
the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of October 31,
2006 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Inherent
Limitations Over Internal Controls

The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

(ii)

provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and
directors; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Management, including the
Company’s CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls
will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all


control systems, no
evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation
of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that
those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

As previously
reported in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended October 31, 2005, management determined that, as of October 31,
2005, there were material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting relating to (i) ineffective controls over the
existence and valuation of its accounts payable related to inventory purchases
and (ii) ineffective controls over the accuracy of the amortization of its
capitalized software development costs. As reported in the Annual Report for
fiscal 2005, the Company initiated a number of changes in its internal controls
to remediate these material weaknesses. As of October 31, 2006, the
following measures to remediate the control deficiencies have been implemented:

·

The
Company developed reports to assist in the analysis of accounts payable related
to inventory purchases to ensure there is adequate and timely reconciliation of
these accounts.

·

The
Company has added an additional level of review of the amortization of
capitalized software development costs to ensure the accuracy of the
information used in this calculation. The Company has also redesigned the
reconciliation schedules in this area to make it easier to review.

Based on the implementation of the additional internal
controls discussed above and the subsequent testing of those internal controls
for a sufficient period of time, management has concluded that the material
weaknesses have been remediated and that the Company’s disclosures and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting are now effective.

The Company’s management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set
forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this
evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2006. The Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has
issued an attestation report on the Company’s assessment of its internal
control over financial reporting. The report on the audit of internal control
over financial reporting appears on page 73 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no significant
changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified
in management’s evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. as of October 31, 2006,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. at October 31, 2006,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective November 1, 2005, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
Share-Based Payment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.’s internal control
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM

The Board of
Directors and Stockholders, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, that Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2006, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc. as of October 31, 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year
then ended, of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and our report dated February 28,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

TAKE-TWO
INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

1.   BASIS OF
PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (the “Company”)
was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 1993. The Company
develops, publishes and distributes interactive software games designed for
video game consoles, handheld platforms and personal computers.

The consolidated financial statements include the
financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and of
entities for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary as
defined in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.” All material inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain amounts in the
financial statements of the prior years have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of net revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant
estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of software development
costs, licenses and intangibles, valuation of inventories, realization of
deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for returns, price
concessions and doubtful accounts. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from these estimates.

In July 2005, the
Entertainment Software Rating Board determined that the Company’s

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

title should carry an Adults
Only (“AO”) rating in North America instead of the previously determined Mature
(“M”) rating. The re-rating of the product negatively impacted its sales, and
as a result, in July 2005, the Company recorded a provision of $32,637 for
estimated product returns. Such provision was subsequently reduced by $8,154 in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 after better than expected sales and lower
processing costs related to product returns. The resulting impact on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations in the fiscal year ended October 31,
2005 was a reduction of approximately $24,500 and $5,900 for net revenue and cost
of goods sold, respectively and a reduction of $18,600 for both gross profit
and income from operations. As of October 31, 2006, the reserve for
estimated product returns related to

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

is zero and no
material adjustments were made to the reserve for the year then ended.

Stock Split

In April 2005, the
Company effected a three-for-two stock split in the form of a stock dividend.
Accordingly, all share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto give retroactive effect to the stock
split.

Financial
Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, approximates fair value because of their short
maturities. The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


The Company transacts
business in various foreign currencies and has significant sales and purchase
transactions denominated in foreign currencies. From time to time, the Company
uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated
with foreign currency assets and liabilities, primarily certain inter-company receivables
and payables. The Company does not designate foreign currency forward contracts
as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” As a result the Company marks to market
its foreign currency forward contracts each period and any gains and losses are
recognized in net income. At October 31, 2006, the Company has no
outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.

Concentration of
Credit Risk

The Company maintains cash balances at several major
financial institutions. While the Company attempts to limit credit exposure
with any single institution, balances often exceed insurable amounts.

If the financial condition
and operations of the Company’s customers deteriorate, the Company’s risk of
collection could increase substantially. A majority of the Company’s trade
receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors. The
Company’s five largest customers accounted for 49.4%, 40.7% and 38.9% of net
revenue in each of the three years ended October 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively. As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, the five largest customers
accounted for 45.4% and 42.7% of gross accounts receivable, respectively.
Customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s gross
accounts receivable balance comprised 36.4% and 16.0% of such balance at October 31,
2006 and 2005. Except for the largest customers noted above, all receivable
balances from the remaining individual customers are less than 10% of the
Company’s net receivable balance. Management believes that the receivable
balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit
risk based on past collection experience.

Inventory, net

Inventories are stated at
the lower of average cost or market. The Company periodically evaluates the
carrying value of its inventories and makes adjustments as necessary. Estimated
product returns are included in the inventory balance at their cost.

Software
Development Costs

The Company utilizes both internal development teams
and third-party software developers to develop the titles it publishes.

The Company capitalizes internal software development
costs (including stock-based compensation, specifically identifiable employee
payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and
release of titles), third-party production and other content costs, subsequent
to establishing technological feasibility of a software title. Amortization of
such capitalized costs is recorded on a title by title basis in cost of goods
sold (software development costs) using (1) the proportion of current year
net revenue to the total net revenue expected to be recorded over the life of
the title or (2) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated
useful life of the title, whichever is greater.

The Company has established an internal royalty
program that allows certain of its employees to participate in the success of
software titles that they assist in developing. Royalties earned by employees
under this program are recorded to cost of goods sold (royalties) as they are
incurred.

The Company frequently enters into agreements with
third-party developers that require the Company to make advance payments for
game development and production services. In exchange for its advance payments,
the Company receives the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the
finished game title as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual
property rights. Such agreements allow the Company


to recover the advance payments to the developers at
an agreed royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software,
net of any agreed costs. The Company capitalizes advance payments as software
development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a
software title and amortizes them, on a title-by-title basis, as royalties in
cost of goods sold. Royalty amortization is recorded using (1) the
proportion of current year net revenue to the total net revenue expected to be
recorded over the life of the title or (2) the contractual, net revenue
based royalty rate defined in the respective agreement, whichever is greater.
At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the recoverability of
advanced development payments and any other unrecognized minimum commitments
that have not been paid. To the extent that advance payments are deemed
unrecoverable, they are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which
such determination is made.

In certain circumstances, management has historically
determined that it is prudent to cancel a development project. At the time such
a decision is made, the Company expenses the related capitalized software
development costs. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the
recoverability of capitalized software costs, using an undiscounted future cash
flow analysis, and charges any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable to cost of
goods sold. The Company uses various measures to estimate future net revenue
for its software titles, including past performance of similar titles and
orders for titles prior to their release. For sequels, the performance of
predecessor titles is also taken into consideration.

The amount of internally
developed software included in software development costs was $76,301 and
$60,324 at October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005, respectively. The
Company records costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility
as research and development expense.

Licenses

Licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to
holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks,
copyrights, technology or other intellectual property rights in the development
of our products. Agreements with license holders generally provide for
guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property. Guaranteed
minimum payments are initially recorded as an asset (licenses) and as a
liability (accrued licenses) upon execution of a licensing agreement, provided
that no significant performance remains with the licensor. When significant
performance remains with the licensor, the Company records payments when
actually paid.

Certain licenses, especially those related to the
Company’s sports products, extend over multi-year periods and encompass
multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments, these
licenses frequently contain provisions that could require the Company to pay
royalties to the license holder based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds.

Capitalized licensing fees
are amortized as royalties in cost of goods sold on a title-by-title basis at a
ratio of (1) current period net revenue to the total net revenue expected
to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or (2) the contractual
royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing
agreement, whichever is greater. Similar to software development costs, the
Company periodically reviews its sales projections to determine the likely
recoverability of its capitalized licenses as well as any unpaid minimum
obligations. When management determines that the value of a license is unlikely
to be recovered by product sales, capitalized licenses are charged to cost of
goods sold, based on current and expected net revenue, in the period in which
such determination is made. Criteria used to evaluate expected product
performance and to estimate future sales for a title include: historical
performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to release; and the
estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title
on which the sequel is based.


Fixed Assets, net

Office equipment,
furniture and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives ranging from five to seven years. Computer
equipment and software are generally depreciated using the straight-line method
over three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the
term of the related lease or estimated useful lives. The cost of additions and
betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to
operations in the periods incurred. When depreciable assets are retired or
sold, the cost and related allowances for depreciation are removed from the
accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. The carrying amounts of these
assets are recorded at historical cost.

Goodwill and
Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of purchase price paid over
identified intangible and tangible net assets of acquired companies. Intangible
assets consist of trademarks, intellectual property, non-compete agreements,
customer lists and acquired technology. Certain intangible assets acquired in a
business combination are recognized as assets apart from goodwill. Identified
intangibles other than goodwill are generally amortized using the straight-line
method over the period of expected benefit ranging from three to ten years,
except for intellectual property, which are usage-based intangible assets that
are amortized using the shorter of the useful life or expected revenue stream.

The Company performs an annual
test for impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or
earlier if indicators of impairment exist. The Company determines the fair
value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compares
such values to the respective reporting unit’s carrying amount. The Company
recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $6,341 in its publishing
segment for the year ended October 31, 2006. The impairment charge was
related to the Company’s Joytech subsidiary, a manufacturer and distributor of
video game accessories and peripherals. At October 31, 2006, the fair
value of the Company’s other reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts and
no impairment was indicated.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews all long-lived assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable, including assets to be disposed of by sale,
whether previously held and used or newly acquired. The Company compares the carrying
amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company records an
impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset
and its fair value. The estimated fair value is generally measured by
discounting expected future cash flows at the Company’s incremental borrowing
rate or fair value, if available.

During the second and
third quarters of fiscal year 2006, the Company took measures to reduce costs
and close three of its underperforming development studios. The Company ceased
the development of certain software titles, resulting in a non-cash impairment
charge (recorded as a component of cost of goods sold) of $20,742 to write-off
unrecoverable capitalized software and royalties costs, primarily in connection
with such studio closures. The Company also wrote-off fixed assets, trademarks
and other assets, resulting in a charge to operating expenses of $7,528 in the
year ended October 31, 2006. In addition, in connection with its goodwill
impairment testing, the Company recognized a charge of $1,739 related to fixed
assets at its Joytech subsidiary that had book values in excess of fair value. All
of such costs were recorded in the Company’s publishing segment.


Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred taxes under the asset
and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently
enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances
are established when the Company determines that it is more likely than not
that such deferred tax assets will not be realized after considering tax
planning strategies, if applicable. No income taxes have been provided on the
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected
to be permanently reinvested in those companies.

The Company’s cumulative U.S.
pre-tax loss in its three most recent fiscal years represents sufficient
negative evidence for the Company to determine that the establishment of a full
valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset is appropriate.

This valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets
associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items. Although
management expects that these assets will ultimately be utilized, future
realization cannot be assured.

Revenue Recognition

The Company earns its revenue from the sale of
internally developed interactive software titles and from the sale of titles
developed by and/or licensed from third-party developers (“Publishing revenue”).
The Company also earns revenue from the sale of interactive software titles
published by third parties, hardware and accessories (“Distribution revenue”).

The Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of
title and risk of loss to its customers. The Company applies the provisions of
Statement of Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition” in conjunction
with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition.” Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for software titles
when there is (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the
customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the
product is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection
of the customer receivable is deemed probable. The Company’s payment
arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60-day terms. Advances
received for software development are reported on the balance sheet as deferred
revenue.

Some of the Company’s software products provide
limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer. Currently,
none of the Company’s products require an internet connection for use, and
online functionality is perceived to be of only incidental value to the
software product itself. When such functionality is offered to the consumer,
the Company does not provide ongoing technical support for gameplay. Accordingly,
the Company considers such features to be an insignificant deliverable and does
not defer revenue related to products containing online features.

Revenue is recognized
after deducting estimated reserves for returns, price concessions and other
allowances. In circumstances when the Company does not have a reliable basis to
estimate returns and price concessions or is unable to determine that
collection of a receivable is probable, it defers the revenue until such time
as it can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine
that collection of the receivable is probable.

Allowances for
Returns, Price Concessions and Other Allowances

The Company accepts returns and grants price
concessions in connection with its publishing arrangements. Following
reductions in the price of its products, the Company grants price concessions
which permit customers to take credits for unsold merchandise against amounts
they owe the Company. The Company’s


customers must satisfy certain conditions to allow
them to return products or receive price concessions, including compliance with
applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.

The Company’s distribution arrangements with customers
do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However,
the Company sometimes accepts returns from its distribution customers for stock
balancing and makes accommodations to customers, which include credits and
returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations.

The Company makes estimates of future product returns
and price concessions related to current period product revenue based upon,
among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in
similar genres, historical performance of a hardware platform, customer
inventory levels, analysis of sell-through rates, sales force and retail
customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand
and acceptance of its products by consumers.

Significant management
judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing
the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. The
Company believes it can make reliable estimates of returns and price
concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a
result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions.
Adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Consideration Given
to Customers and Received from Vendors

The Company has various marketing arrangements with
retailers and distributors of its products that provide for cooperative
advertising and market development funds, among others. Such amounts are
accrued as a reduction to revenue when revenue is recognized, except for
cooperative advertising which is included in selling and marketing expenses if
there is a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit’s fair value can be
established.

The Company also receives
various incentives from its manufacturers. Such amounts are generally accounted
for as a reduction in the price of the manufacturer’s product and included as a
reduction of inventory or cost of goods sold, except where the incentive is in
exchange for services rendered by the Company. Incentives in exchange for
services are included in revenue providing there is an identifiable benefit to
the vendor and the benefit’s value can be established.

Advertising

The Company expenses
advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended October 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004 amounted to $83,533, $101,077 and $72,165, respectively.

Research and
Development Expense

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. A substantial portion of research and
development costs are capitalized once software development projects reach
technological feasibility, which is relatively early in the development
process. See Note 7 “Software Development Costs.”


Net Income (Loss)
per Share

Basic
earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing the net income applicable to
common stockholders for the year by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net
income applicable to common stockholders for the year by the weighted average
number of common and common stock equivalents, which include common shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock and warrants
outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the
computation if their effect is antidilutive.

The effect of the Company’s
restatement for stock-based compensation, as discussed in Note 2, did not have
a significant impact on diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the
years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004. The computation for diluted
weighted average shares outstanding excludes those unexercised stock options
and warrants, which are antidilutive. The number of such shares was
approximately 7,208, 3,126 and 579 for the years ended October 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

Stock-based
Compensation

Effective November 1, 2005, the Company adopted
SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”, which revised Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based
payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service
period based on their relative fair values. Prior to the adoption of SFAS
123(R), stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options was
not recognized in the statement of operations if the exercise price was at
least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date, in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees.” Prior to November 1, 2005, the Company had
adopted the disclosure-only provisions under SFAS 123.

The Company elected to use
the Modified Prospective Application (“MPA”) method for implementing SFAS
123(R). Under the MPA method, prior periods are not restated and new awards are
valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption. Outstanding prior stock
option awards that are non-vested as of October 31, 2005 are recognized as
compensation expense in the statement of operations over the remaining
requisite service period. For the year ended October 31, 2006, the Company
recorded approximately $11,500 of incremental stock-based compensation expense
in connection with its adoption of SFAS 123(R). See Note 14 for a full
discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation arrangements.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign
operations is primarily the applicable local currency. Accounts of foreign
operations are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for assets and
liabilities at the balance sheet date and average prevailing exchange rates for
the period for revenue and expense accounts. Adjustments resulting from
translation are included in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized and
unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in
which they occur, except on inter-company balances considered to be long term.
Transaction gains and losses on inter-company balances considered to be long
term are recorded in other comprehensive income. Foreign


exchange transaction gains included in net income for
the years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $2,176, $1,560
and $1,199, respectively.

Comprehensive income
(loss) is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company’s items of other
comprehensive income (loss) are foreign currency translation adjustments, which
relate to investments that are permanent in nature and therefore do not require
tax adjustments.

Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

(“SFAS 157”), which clarifies the definition of fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS
157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS
157 will be effective for the Company on November 1, 2008. The Company is
currently assessing whether the adoption of SFAS 157 will have an impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB
108 provides interpretive guidance on the SEC’s views on how the effects of the
carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in
quantifying a current year misstatement. The provisions of SAB 108 will be
effective for the Company on November 1, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of applying SAB 108 but does not believe that the
application of SAB 108 will have a material effect on its financial position,
cash flows, and results of operations.

In June 2006, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109

(“FIN 48”),
to create a single model to address the accounting for uncertainty in tax
positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, measurement, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for the
Company on November 1, 2007. The cumulative-effect of adopting FIN 48 will
be recorded to retained earnings. Management is currently evaluating the
effect, if any, that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

2.   RESTATEMENT
OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The consolidated balance sheet as of October 31,
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005
and 2004 included in these consolidated financial statements, are presented on
a restated basis for the reasons described below.


As the Company previously reported, on June 23,
2006, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), based on the
recommendation of the Company’s management, initiated an investigation of all
of the Company’s stock option grants during the period from its April 15,
1997 initial public offering (“IPO”) through June 2006 and assigned the
investigation to a Special Committee of its Board consisting of three
independent members of the Board (the “Special Committee”). On July 7,
2006, the Special Committee retained independent legal counsel, and such
counsel retained independent accounting advisors (collectively the
“Investigative Team”). The investigation included a broad and extensive
document review (including the Company’s 1997 and 2002 Stock Option Plans, all
Compensation Committee minutes, Board minutes, employment agreements, stock
option agreements, offer letters, emails, accounting records such as earnings
per share schedules, master option tracking schedules and other correspondence
and materials contained in personnel files) and interviews of certain present
and former Company officers, Directors and employees who were involved in or
appeared to have knowledge of the issuance of the grants. During the period
from April 15, 1997 through June 2006 the Company issued
approximately 1,100 stock option grants at irregular intervals and for a
variety of reasons including employee hiring, retention and promotion awards,
broad-based awards, executive incentive awards and awards made in connection
with business acquisitions. The Investigative Team found that the Company, in
granting options, failed in many cases to comply with the terms of its Stock
Option Plans, did not maintain adequate control and compliance procedures for
option grants, and did not generate or maintain adequate or appropriate
documentation of such grants.

In particular, the Investigative Team concluded that
between April 1997 and August 2003, the former Chairman/CEO of the
Company, who resigned from his last (non-executive) position with the Company in
October 2006, controlled and dominated the stock option granting process. More
specifically, during that period, numerous option grants appear to have been
backdated through a variety of methods. It was determined that the former
Chairman/CEO of the Company was primarily responsible for the selection of
exercise prices and grant dates and the resulting backdating issues and was
assisted by certain past employees and past members of management. The
Investigative Team concluded, among other things, that the conduct of these
individuals raised concerns about the reliability of their representations to
the Company’s independent auditors and as a result the Company has concluded
that such concerns are applicable to representations made by these individuals
to the Company.

Furthermore, available contemporaneous documentation
that was used by the Company to support its stock option grants was found by
The Investigative Team to be unreliable, deficient or nonexistent in many cases.
This documentation primarily took the form of stock option agreements,
interoffice stock grant requests and beginning in May 2002, undated stock
option grant letters, most of which were authorized and signed by the former
Chairman/CEO. The Investigative Team found no evidence that the Company’s
current senior executive management engaged in any misconduct with respect to
the Company’s option granting practices. They also determined that while the
members of the Compensation Committee abdicated their responsibility, with
respect to the granting of stock options, they did not engage in any willful
misconduct or other dishonest acts.

It was determined that due to the backdating practices
and the lack of contemporaneous or reliable documentation, all stock option
grants should be reviewed, analyzed and re-measured based on the most reliable
existing documentation.

The Investigative Team conducted forensic analysis of
all available written and electronic documents, the result of which established
a set of documents to analyze stock option granting activity. Consistent with
the accounting literature and recent guidance from the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) staff,


the grants during the relevant period were organized
into categories based on the grant type. After reviewing all available relevant
documentation, a general hierarchy of documentation was considered when
establishing an appropriate measurement date for accounting purposes. Although
the hierarchy was considered, each grant was evaluated individually based on
the particular facts and circumstances in each case. The documentation
considered was:

·

Minutes
of Board of Directors or Compensation Committee meetings (“Minutes”);

·

Date
of hire (if the grant was a new hire grant, evidenced by an employment
agreement or offer letter);

·

Correspondence
or other documentation supporting the option grant (e.g. emails, internal
memos, Forms 4, and other materials contained in personnel files);

·

Earliest
date  as evidenced by (a) updating
of the Company’s master stock option tracking spreadsheets (the Company’s
tracking system which accumulated all stock option grants and all relevant
terms, which was updated with new grants continuously, for which forensic
analysis provided a date on which the option grant was first included in the
Company’s master option spreadsheet) (b) stock option exercise dates or (c) inclusion
in quarterly diluted earnings per share calculation records (the “EPS Records”).

The Company identified certain stock option grants as
having approvals of the allocation of shares to specific individuals and an
exercise price evidenced by dated Minutes, which differed from the measurement
date that was indicated within the Company’s master stock option tracking
spreadsheets. Often, awards had an approval date in the Minutes that was
subsequent to the grant and measurement date reported by the Company within the
Company’s stock option award documentation. Other grants were found to have
been assigned measurement dates subsequent to documented approval in the
Minutes which would have indicated a potential re-pricing of the options,
specifically when there was a significant time lag between the approval in the
minutes and the measurement date and the price on the measurement date was
significantly lower. Accordingly, certain of these grants were determined to
have been awarded on the date approved by the Compensation committee and
re-priced on a subsequent date, particularly for grants that the Investigative
Team believed the recipients would have been knowledgeable of the Compensation
Committee’s approval and the key terms and conditions of the grant. Furthermore,
in certain instances the Minutes acknowledged prior approvals of stock-based
compensation awards although no documentation of such approval exists in the
Company’s records. In each of the cases described above, the Company determined
that the originally assigned measurement dates could not be reliably supported
and such grants should be based on dates documented in the Minutes. As a
result, the Company re-measured and accounted for these awards as fixed
(variable with respect to the options considered to be re-priced) on the date
indicated in the Minutes.

The Company issued stock options in connection with
employment agreements, offer letters, or other documentation indicative of an
employee’s start of employment, but such awards often had measurement dates
prior to the actual commencement of employment. The Company determined the
appropriate measurement date for these grants to be the date on which the
employee commenced employment.

The Company also identified certain stock option
grants where the sole evidence was the aforementioned stock option agreements,
interoffice request forms or stock option grant letters and employment
agreement amendments (collectively, “Non-contemporaneous Dated Documents”).
Stock option agreements included terms of the option grant and typically used “as
of” dating to document such terms, and the Investigative Team concluded that it
was unlikely that such agreements were signed by the Company and the employee
on a contemporaneous basis. The interoffice request forms were undated standard
forms that reflected the term of the option grants including, in some cases,
grant dates. Stock option grant letters were also undated correspondence that
reflected all of the terms of the options. The


stock option grant letter became the primary means of
documenting all of the terms of the option grants beginning in May 2002. At
that time, the Company memorialized all prior option grants by preparing stock
option grant letters and these grant letters were not contemporaneously prepared.
All of the Non-contemporaneous Dated Documents were either authorized or signed
by the former Chairman/CEO until March 2004 when he stepped-down as
Chairman. As noted above, the Investigative Team found the former Chairman/CEO
to have engaged in a pattern and practice of backdating option grants and
determined that he could not be relied upon. Accordingly, any form of stock
grant documentation that was authorized and/or signed by him and for which
there was no other evidence that corroborated that measurement date, was deemed
to be unreliable for measurement purposes.

Employment agreement amendments typically acknowledged
a previous grant of options or a new grant and there was either limited or no
documentation supporting the previous grant. Frequently, the indicated date of
the grant was considered a “fortuitous” date (i.e. a date on which the Company’s
stock price was at a low point during the period). The Investigative Team found
evidence that the indicated grant date within such agreements was often
unreliable for measurement purposes, and in some cases the amendment itself was
backdated.

With respect to the Non-contemporaneous Dated
Documents or otherwise unsupported grants, the Investigative Team reviewed and
analyzed all available correspondence, including the master stock option
tracking spreadsheets to determine the date on which the option was first
entered into the spreadsheet, and the first period the grant was included in
the EPS Records. The Company used available metadata and other computer
generated records to determine the date on which the award was first entered
into these spreadsheets. If the first date that the option was entered into the
spreadsheet was identified, that date was used as the measurement date after
considering any other available documentation. In cases where the date of first
entry in the master option tracking spreadsheet was subsequent to the quarter
in which the grant was first included in the EPS Records, these EPS Records
were used for the determination of the measurement date.

EPS
Records were only considered when there was no earlier correspondence or other
evidence to document a more reliable measurement date.

The Company believes that this evidence, as supported
by the Investigative Team’s conclusions, is consistent with the provisions of
APB 25 whereby the measurement date is the first date on which the number of
shares that each individual is allocated and the related option price is
determined with employee notification soon afterwards (i.e. a “mutual
understanding” between the employee and the Company of the key terms and
conditions of an award)  (See paragraph
below regarding actual date selected). While the number of shares and their
corresponding exercise prices were identified in all of the Non-contemporaneous
Dated Documents or employment agreement amendments referred to above, the
Investigative Team determined that in many instances these documents were not
contemporaneously prepared and, as noted above, could not be relied upon for
the measurement date. Additionally, the Investigative Team noted that the
granting process and related approvals, whether formally approved by the
Compensation Committee or authorized by the former Chairman/CEO, occurred prior
to including the grant and its terms in master stock option tracking
spreadsheets and the EPS Records. Once grants and their relevant terms were
included in these spreadsheets or the EPS Records, changes to key terms
(exercise price, number of shares, vesting period and identified employee) did
not occur.

Where evidence of a stock option grant was limited to
the EPS Records, this evidence does not result in a specific date as required
under APB 25, but rather the period in which the measurement date occurred. Accordingly,
the Company considered the qualitative and quantitative attributes of several
alternatives, including using the date of the Company’s high and median closing
stock price in each quarter. In the absence of evidence to support a more
appropriate measurement date, the Company has selected the first instance of
the highest quoted stock price in the quarter that the stock option grant was
first included in the EPS Records as its measurement date for such stock option
grants. The Company believes that this ensures that a sufficient amount of
compensation expense results and that this date is equally probable to


any other date in the quarter. Furthermore, neither
existing documentation nor the results of the investigation indicate that there
is a more appropriate date. This methodology resulted in the Company recognizing
approximately $25 million of cumulative pre-tax stock-based compensation
expense for the period April 15, 1997, the date of the Company’s IPO,
through October 31, 2005.

If the Company had instead used the median closing
price of its common stock in the corresponding quarters, rather than the
highest price, the Company estimates that it would have reduced its cumulative
pre-tax stock-based compensation charge by approximately $13 million. Restated
cumulative net income (i.e. net income from the date of the Company’s IPO
through October 31, 2005) would have been approximately 3% higher if the
Company had used the median closing price of its common stock, rather than the
highest price. The Company has deemed the difference between recording
compensation expense based on the Company’s high and median closing stock
prices to be quantitatively immaterial in the aggregate and to each individual
fiscal year since the Company’s IPO, except for the Company’s fiscal years
ended 2001 and 2000, when such difference would have impacted the Company’s
previously reported net income by approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million,
respectively. However, the Company believes that these differences, in
isolation, are not qualitatively material and would not impact an investor’s
prospective opinion or valuation of the Company.

The Company also reviewed 84 restricted stock awards
that were issued between May 2002 and June 2006 and identified 10
instances in which such awards had measurement dates that did not correspond
with Minutes, employment agreements, offer letters, or other documentation
indicative of an employee’s start date of employment. As a result, the Company
recognized additional cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $0.6
million, net of tax, through October 31, 2005 related to these awards.

Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, the
Company applied the controlling accounting standards in each year to determine,
for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the
measurement date was not the original date that was reported in the records of
the Company, accounting adjustments were made to record compensation expense
based on the difference between the closing price on the revised measurement
and the exercise price. The restatement as a result of the Special Committee
investigation resulted in stock-based compensation expense and tax effects
totaling approximately $54.6 million ($42.1 million, net of tax) from the IPO
through October 31, 2005. The Investigative Team used a significant amount
of judgment in examining each separate option grant and also in determining the
new measurement date applied to each grant in the Company’s calculation of
compensation expense.


The
resulting impact of the restatement on stock-based compensation expense, which
was previously reported as a component of operating expenses in the Company’s
statements of operations, is as follows:

Additionally, the Company restated the pro forma
expense under SFAS No. 123 in Note 14 to reflect the impact of these
adjustments.

The Company is in the process of determining the
extent of the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of
re-measured stock options. The adverse tax consequences are that re-measured stock
options vesting after December 31, 2004 (“409A Affected Options”) subject
the option holder to a penalty tax under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 409A
(and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes).


One action being considered the Company is to offer to
amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the exercise price to the market
price on the accounting measurement date or, if lower, the market price at the
time of the amendment. The amended options would not be subject to taxation
under IRC Section 409A. Under IRS regulations, these option amendments had
to be completed by December 31, 2006 for anyone who was an executive
officer when he or she received 409A Affected Options; the amendments for
non-executive officers cannot be offered until after this Form 10-K is
filed and do not need to be completed until December 31, 2007. Another
possible action is to approve bonuses payable to holders of the amended options
to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise price.
The amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the Company if and
when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid (but
there is no assurance that the options will be exercised). The Company has not
determined what actions it will take, if any, with respect to 409A Affected
Options. Any charges that arise from actions taken by the Company will be
recorded in the period in which the determinations are made.

The Company also believes that United States tax
deductions taken for stock option exercises in prior years, which pertained to
certain executives, may not be deductible under limitations imposed by IRC Section 162(m).
Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation above $1
million to certain executive officers of public companies when such
compensation is not incentive-based. The Special Committee found that many of
the stock options granted to executives had intrinsic value on the basis of the
new measurement dates determined for US GAAP financial statement purposes and
therefore, under Section 162(m), may not be incentive-based and may not be
tax deductible by the Company. As a result the Company has reduced its
available tax net operating loss carry-forwards arising from certain exercised
stock options and restricted stock. Separately, the Company also identified
certain restricted stock grants and bonuses paid in prior periods that may be
ineligible for deduction under section 162(m). The Company restated its tax provisions
in the periods in which the benefits were recorded. The Company is in
discussions with the IRS to settle these uncertainties regarding additional
liabilities; however, there is no assurance that they will be settled on terms
favorable to the Company.

As a result of its review, the Company also determined
that it failed to properly withhold an immaterial amount of employment taxes
associated with certain stock option exercises. The Company has recorded such
amounts in its consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the
Company was originally obligated to make the withholding.

The Company has restated prior year income tax amounts
in Note 13 to reflect the impacts of the adjustments described above.


The
following table presents the effects of the adjustments made to the Company’s
previously reported consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2005 for
the stock options restatement described above as well as, in 2005, to correct

and liabilities related to the Company’s stock options restatement primarily

this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.

In December 2003, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock and assumed certain liabilities of TDKM. Total
consideration paid included the issuance of 163,641 shares of the Company’s
common stock. Although the acquisition was considered significant, the proforma
impact on our consolidated financial statements in the 2004 period was not
material because the acquisition was made near the beginning of the fiscal
year.

The Company has product development agreements with
Blue Castle Games, Inc. (“Blue Castle”), a software development studio
responsible for creating certain of the Company’s sports titles. Based on the
terms of the agreements, Blue Castle is considered a variable interest entity
and the Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle’s
future profits or losses. As a result, pursuant to FIN 46 (R), the financial
position and results of operations of Blue Castle are included in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2006. The
Company does not have any equity ownership in Blue Castle. The consolidation of
Blue Castle did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Pursuant to FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” the results of operations of Destineer Publishing Corp. (“Destineer”),
a publisher of PC games, were consolidated in the Company’s financial
statements from November 1, 2003 through January 31, 2005. Effective February 1,
2005, the Company is no longer considered the primary beneficiary of Destineer
and does not hold a significant variable interest in Destineer. Accordingly,
pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46 (R), the results of Destineer’s
operations are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements
subsequent to February 1, 2005. The consolidation of Destineer did not
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In connection with the
evaluation of goodwill, the Company identified certain fixed assets within its
publishing segment that had book values in excess of their fair values. As a
result, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $2,329 in the second
and third quarters of the year ended October 31, 2006 to state such fixed
assets at fair value.

8.

GOODWILL
AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually
in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances
indicate impairment may have occurred. During the third quarter of the year
ended October 31, 2006, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge
of $6,341 related to its Joytech subsidiary, the Company’s manufacturer and
distributor of video game accessories and peripherals, which operates within
its publishing segment. The impairment charge was recorded as a component of
operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and
was determined by comparing the fair value of the Joytech business and the
implied value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets, with the carrying
amounts on the balance sheet. The decline in the fair value of the Joytech
business was due to continued competition and a decline in the price and sales
volume of current generation accessories due to weaker market conditions and
the ongoing transition to next-generation hardware platforms. The Company
performed an annual impairment assessment of goodwill for its remaining
reporting units as of August 1, 2006 and did not identify any further
impairment.

LINES
OF CREDIT

In August 2005, the Company entered into a credit
agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”). The JPMorgan credit
agreement provided for borrowings of up to $50,000 through the expiration of
the agreement on August 23, 2006. The Company had no borrowings under the
credit agreement through its expiration date and did not renew the credit
agreement with JPMorgan.


In May 2006, the
Company’s United Kingdom subsidiary renewed its credit facility agreement with
Lloyds TSB Bank plc (“Lloyds”) under which Lloyds agreed to make available
borrowings of up to approximately $23,000.  The credit facility is primarily secured by
the Company’s international cash and accounts receivable balances. Advances
under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of 1.25% per annum over the
bank’s base rate, and are guaranteed by the Company. Available borrowings under
the agreement are reduced by the amount of outstanding guarantees. The facility
expires on March 31, 2007. The utilized portion of this facility at October 31,
2006 was approximately $10,178 for standby letters of credit. The Company had
no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of October 31, 2006.

LEGAL
AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS

In July 2005, the Company received three
purported class action complaints against the Company and Rockstar Games, two
of which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and one such complaint which was filed in the United
States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On September 8,
2005, another similar complaint was filed in the Circuit Court for the
Twentieth Judicial District, St. Clair County, Illinois and then removed to
United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The
plaintiffs, alleged purchasers of the Company’s

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

game, allege that the Company
and Rockstar Games engaged in consumer deception, false advertising and common
law fraud and were unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure of the
Company and Rockstar Games to disclose that

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content, which resulted
in the game receiving an “M” rating from the ESRB rather than an “AO” rating.
The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of various violations of
law and litigation costs. The New York and Pennsylvania actions, together with
an action commenced against the Company and Rockstar Games in the United States
District for the Southern District of New York in August 2006, have been
consolidated in the Southern District of New York under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer Litigation

, (05-CV-6734
(BSJ)) and the Illinois action has been transferred to the Southern District of
New York for coordinated pretrial proceedings pursuant to an Order of Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. These cases have been consolidated for
pretrial proceedings under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video
Game Consumer Litigation

(No. II)

,
06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD). On  June 7,
2006  plaintiffs filed a Consolidated and
Amended Complaint. On July 31, 2006, the Company and Rockstar Games filed
a Partial Motion to Dismiss those claims brought under the laws of states other
than states where the named plaintiffs’ reside and were purportedly injured. By
an Opinion and Order dated


October 25, 2006, the Partial Motion to Dismiss
was denied. On November 10, 2006 the Company and Rockstar Games filed a
Motion to Deny Certification of the proposed nationwide class. On November 17,
2006 the Company and Rockstar Games served an answer denying the allegations in
the Consolidated and Amended Complaint and asserting various affirmative
defenses. On January 24, 2007, the Plaintiffs cross-moved for
certification of the proposed nationwide class. Consolidated discovery in these
actions is proceeding.

In January 2006, the City Attorney for the City
of Los Angeles filed a complaint against the Company and Rockstar Games in the
Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint alleges that the
Company and Rockstar Games violated sections of the California Business and
Professions Code prohibiting untrue and misleading statements and unfair
competition and that the Company and Rockstar Games were unjustly enriched as a
result of the alleged failure to disclose that

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content which should have
resulted in the game receiving an Adults Only (“AO”) rating from the ESRB
rather than a Mature (“M”) rating. The complaint also alleges that the Company
made misleading statements as to the origin of the “hidden” content. The
complaint seeks injunctive relief, restitution for purchasers of the game and
civil fines. The action has been removed to the United States District Court,
Central District of California and the Company moved to dismiss the complaint.
The plaintiff has moved to remand the action to state court and the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has issued an order transferring the action
to the Southern District of New York  and
the action was consolidated for pre-trial purposes with

In re Grand
Theft Auto Video Game Consumer Litigation

(No. II)

,
06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD).

In November 2006, a complaint was filed against
the Company and Rockstar Games in the United States District Court, Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, alleging that the Company and Rockstar Games engaged
in consumer deception,  were unjustly
enriched and in breach of warranty as a result of the alleged failure of the
Company and Rockstar Games to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

contained “hidden” content, which resulted in the game
receiving an “M” rating from the ESRB rather than an “AO” rating. The complaint
seeks unspecified damages, declarations of various violations of law and
litigation costs. The Company and Rockstar Games have filed a Notice of
Tag-along Action with the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation,
requesting that the case be transferred to the Southern District of New York
for pretrial consolidation with

In re Grand Theft Auto
Video Game Consumer Litigation (No. II)

, 06-MD-1739
(SWK)(MHD). On January 26, 2007, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation issued a Conditional Transfer Order, transferring this action to the
Southern District of New York for pre-trial consolidation with

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer Litigation

(No. II)

, 06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD).

In February and March 2006, an aggregate of
four purported class action complaints were filed against the Company, its
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Global
Operating Officer in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (the “New York Actions”) and one such purported class action was
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
(the “Michigan Action”). The New York plaintiffs are Max Kaplan, John
Fenninger, David Andrews and David Toth and the Michigan plaintiff was The City
of Flint and Daniel J. Hall on behalf of The City of Flint Employees’
Retirement Pension Fund. The complaints allege that the defendants violated
Sections 10(b), 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) by making or causing the Company to make untrue
statements or failing to disclose in certain press releases and SEC periodic
reports that, among other things:

Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content which should have
resulted in the game receiving an Adults Only (“AO”) rating from the ESRB
rather than a Mature (“M”) rating; the defendants attempted to bolster sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

by
concealing the “adult content” from retailers who refused to carry AO material;
the Company’s management failed to keep its Board of Directors informed of
important issues or failed to do so in a timely fashion; and the Company was
misstating capitalized software development costs and amortization expense and
had inadequate internal controls and procedures to ensure accuracy in its
reported financial


results. The plaintiffs seek to recover unspecified
damages and their costs. The plaintiffs in the Michigan Action voluntarily
dismissed their complaint without prejudice. On July 12, 2006, the Court
entered Orders appointing the New York City Pension Funds as lead plaintiff and
directing the filing of a consolidated amended complaint within sixty (60) days.
Plaintiffs filed a consolidated and amended complaint on September 11,
2006. The amended complaint added claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act related to allegedly improper stock option
granting practices at the Company. On December 11, 2006, the Company
announced the preliminary results of an internal investigation into its
historical stock option granting practices. The preliminary findings showed
that there were improprieties in the process of granting and documenting stock
options, and that incorrect measurement dates for certain stock option grants
were used for financial accounting purposes. The Company further announced that
it will need to restate previous financial statements and that its statements
between 1997 and April 30, 2006, should not be relied upon. As a result of
these announcements the parties have entered into a stipulation modifying the
current scheduling order. Pursuant to the stipulation, all pending deadlines
have been stayed pending a decision by plaintiffs as to whether they will file
a second amended complaint reflecting our recent announcements.

In January 2006, the St. Clair Shores General
Employees Retirement System filed a purported class and derivative action
complaint in the Southern District of New York against the Company, as nominal
defendant, and certain of its officers and directors and certain former
officers and directors. The factual allegations in this action are similar to
the allegations contained in the New York Actions. Plaintiff asserts that
certain defendants breached their fiduciary duty by selling the Company’s stock
while in possession of certain material non-public information and breached
their fiduciary duty and violated Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9
of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose material facts in the Company’s
2003, 2004 and 2005 proxy statements in which the Company solicited approval to
increase share availability under its 2002 Stock Option Plan. Plaintiff seeks
the return of all profits from the alleged insider trading conducted by the
individual defendants who sold the Company’s stock, unspecified compensatory
damages with interest and their costs in the action. A motion to stay the
action pending the determination of an investigation by the Special Committee
was filed with the Court. On October 4, 2006, the Court issued an order
granting the motion and staying the proceedings for a period of 150 days from
the date of the Order. On January 17, 2007, the plaintiffs moved for an
order granting limited relief from the Court’s October 4, 2006 stay of the
proceedings in order to file an Amended Derivative and Class Action
Complaint.

In July 2006, Richard Lasky filed a purported
derivative action complaint in the Southern District of New York against the
Company, as nominal defendant, and certain of its officers and directors and
certain former officers and directors. The complaint alleges violations of
federal and state law, including violations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
the Exchange Act, breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross
mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment that allegedly
occurred between January 2000 and the present. The complaint also asserts
claims alleging the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection
with the granting of stock options to certain officers and directors between
1997 and the present. The complaint seeks unspecified damages against all of
the individual defendants, reimbursement from certain of the defendants of
bonuses or other incentive or equity based compensation paid to them by the
Company during its fiscal year ended October 31, 2003, equitable and other
relief relating to the proceeds from certain of the defendants’ alleged
improper trading activity in the Company’s stock, adoption of certain corporate
governance proposals and recovery of litigation costs.

On August 22, 2006, a shareholder derivative
complaint was filed by Raeda Karadsheh in the United States District Court of
the Southern District of New York against the Company, as nominal defendant,
and certain of its current and former officers and directors. The Karadsheh
Complaint asserts claims related to the Company’s stock option granting
practices. On November 22, 2006, the Court entered an Order consolidating
the two actions and providing plaintiffs with forty-five (45) days from the
date of the Order


to file a consolidated complaint. The Plaintiffs filed
a consolidated complaint on January 22, 2007. The consolidated complaint
focuses exclusively on the Company’s historical stock option granting
practices.

In January 2006, Todd Veeck filed a complaint in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company pursuant to
8 DEL. C.

§ 220 to compel inspection of the Company’s
books and records in order to “investigate” possible breaches of fiduciary
duties with regard to the creation, development, marketing and sale of its

Grand Theft Auto

line of products. The
parties were able to amicably resolve this action, which was dismissed with
prejudice on December 11, 2006.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of
the Estates of Arnold Strickland, James Crump and Ace Mealer brought an action
in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against the Company, Rockstar
Games, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. (“SCEA”), Sony Corporation of
America (“SCA”), Wal-Mart, GameStop and Devin Moore alleging under Alabama’s
manufacturers’ liability and wrongful death statutes that the Company’s video
games designed, manufactured, marketed and/or supplied to Mr. Moore
resulted in “copycat violence” that caused the death of Messrs. Strickland,
Crump and Mealer. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against
all of the defendants in excess of $600 million. Wal-Mart, SCEA and SCA have
tendered their defense and requested indemnification from the Company, and the
Company has accepted such tender. The Company’s motion to dismiss the action
was denied and the Company moved to have certain issues certified for an
immediate interlocutory appeal before the Alabama Supreme Court. The Company
also separately pursued a petition to dismiss claims against it and Rockstar
Games, for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Alabama Supreme Court declined to
accept the interlocutory appeal, but agreed to hear the petition to dismiss the
action for lack of personal jurisdiction. Briefing has been completed on such
petition, and the matter is now pending before the Supreme Court. In April 2006,
the plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint to add a claim for civil
conspiracy; the Company and its co-defendants have moved to dismiss that claim
and the motion is pending. In October  2006, the trial court amended a
prior Scheduling Order to set (a) a hearing on the admissibility of
Plaintiffs’ expert opinions for April 6, 2007; (b) completion of all
fact and expert discovery by October 12, 2007; (c) mediation for November 8,
2007; and (d) trial (if necessary) to commence no earlier than January 14,
2008.

In September 2006, the personal representatives
of the Estates of Verlin Posey, Tryone Posey, and Marilea Schmid brought an
action in the Second Judicial District of Bernalillo County, New Mexico in
Albuquerque against the Company; Rockstar Games; SCEA; SCA and Cody Posey (“Posey”),
alleging under New Mexico’s products liability and wrongful death statutes that
the Company’s video games resulted in “copycat violence” that caused Posey to
shoot and kill his father (Verlin Posey), stepmother (Tryone Posey) and
stepsister (Marilea Schmid). At his criminal trial, Posey argued self-defense,
and presented extensive testimony of long-term substantial physical abuse by
his father. Posey was convicted of manslaughter in his father’s death, second
degree murder for his stepmother’s death, and first degree murder for his
stepsister’s death. At sentencing in April 2006, the judge concluded that
Posey suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and had “snapped”
when he committed the killings; rather than sentence Posey to life in prison,
the judge sentenced him to a juvenile facility until he turns twenty-one. The
suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants
in excess of $600 million. SCEA and SCA have tendered their defense and
requested indemnification from the Company, and the Company has accepted such
tender. Copies of the Complaint and Summonses were received by the Company in December 2006;
and the Company moved to dismiss the Complaint on January 19, 2007.


The Company intends to vigorously defend and seek
dismissal of these matters and, with respect to the derivative actions, the
Company has been advised that the individual defendants will vigorously defend
such actions. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters
and, if determined adversely to the Company, such matters, either singly or in
the aggregate, could result in the imposition of significant judgments, fines
and/or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, cash flows or results of operations.

The Company has received notice from the SEC that it
is conducting an informal non-public investigation into certain stock option
grants made by it from January 1997 to the present. Prior to receiving the
notice, the Company had initiated an internal review of its option grants, led
by a committee consisting of independent board members who have retained
independent legal counsel and accountants to assist in the review. The Company
and the Special Committee are fully cooperating with the SEC.

The Company has received grand jury subpoenas issued
by the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting production of
documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including
those relating to, among other things: the so-called “Hot Coffee” scenes in
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas; the work of  the Company’s Board of
Directors, all Board Committees, and the Special Litigation Committee; certain
acquisitions entered into by  the Company ; billing and payment
records relating to Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLC (“PWC”) and the termination of
PWC as  the Company’s  auditors; communications to financial
analysts and stockholders about acquisitions and financial results;
compensation and human resources documents of certain  of the
Company’s  directors and employees; stock-based compensation; the
SEC ’s  June 2006 inquiry; legal services performed for
employees; corporate credit card and expense records of certain individuals;
the SEC bar of  the Company’s  former Chief Executive Officer,
Ryan Brant; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies and
questionnaires.  The Company is fully cooperating and providing the
documents and information called for by the subpoenas.

The Company has also received a request for
information from the Internal Revenue Service that includes a request for
records relating to the grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken
by the Company pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for
the period from October 31, 2000 to October 31, 2004. The Company is
fully cooperating and providing the requested documents.

The Company is also
involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of its business, which in
its opinion will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition,
cash flows or results of operations.

Licensing
and Marketing Agreements:

The Company’s
licensing commitments primarily consist of obligations to holders of
intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks, copyrights,
technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of the
Company’s products. As of October 31, 2006, $1,841 of the Company’s
guaranteed minimum licensing and marketing commitments are recorded in its
consolidated balance sheet because the licensor does not have any significant
performance obligation to the Company. Licensing and marketing commitments
expire at various times though December 2012 and primarily reflect the
Company’s agreements with major sports leagues and players’ associations.
Certain of the Company’s licensing and marketing agreements also contain
provisions that would impose penalties in the event that the Company fails to
meet agreed upon software release dates.

Software
Development Agreements:

The Company makes
payments to third-party software developers that include contractual advances
and royalties under several software development agreements that expire at
various times through November 2008. The Company’s aggregate outstanding
software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by third-party
software developers.

Lease
Commitments:

The Company’s office and warehouse
facilities are occupied under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at
various times through July 2015. The Company also leases certain
furniture, equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable leases expiring
through August 2011. Some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also
include inducements to enter into the lease. The effect of such amounts are
deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term.
Rent expense amounted to $16,658, $13,484, and $9,713 for the years ended
October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Distribution
Agreements:

The Company periodically enters into
distribution agreements to purchase software games for resale. At
October 31, 2006 the Company’s distribution agreements expired at various
dates through July 2008.

Contingent
Consideration:

Part of the Company’s
business acquisition strategy has been to make a portion of the purchase price
of certain acquisitions dependent on product delivery or future product sales.
See Note 3 for a discussion of the Company’s contingent commitments related to
its business acquisitions.

Employee savings plan:

The Company maintains a
401(k) retirement savings plan and trust (the “401(k) Plan”). The
401(k) Plan is offered to all eligible employees and participants may make
voluntary contributions. The Company began matching a portion of the
contributions in July 2002. The matching contribution expense incurred by
the Company during the years ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$1,989, $864 and $583, respectively.

13.

INCOME TAXES

In connection with the
restatement of the consolidated financial statements, as described in
Note 2, adjustments have been made to the income tax expense reported in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for tax benefits previously
recognized in additional paid-in capital in the statement of stockholders’
equity. Pursuant to section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, stock
options that have intrinsic value at the time of grant do not qualify for the
performance-based exception to the $1,000 limitation in the deduction of
compensation expense for covered employees. The Company’s income tax returns
are presently being examined by the Internal Revenue Service and the Company
has notified the Internal Revenue Service of the stock option review.

The lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 is
a result of the Company recording a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax
assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary
differences. It is more-likely-than-not that such deferred tax assets will not
be realized.


The
effects of temporary differences that give rise to the Company’s deferred tax
assets and liabilities are as follows:

The Company has concluded
that, based on expected future results and the future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, it is more likely than not that certain deferred
tax assets, principally net operating losses and capital losses, cannot be used
in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been
established for these tax benefits.

At October 31, 2006,
the Company had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward totaling $57,830
that will expire in fiscal period 2026; a U.S. federal capital loss
carryforward of $18,274 that will expire in fiscal periods 2007 and 2008; and a
foreign net operating loss carryforward of $17,458 that will expire in fiscal
periods 2010 except for $10,555 that may be carried forward indefinitely.

The total amount of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was approximately $176,000 and
$166,000 for the years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. It
is the Company’s intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance. Accordingly,
no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States income
taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries are paid as dividends to the Company.

The Company is regularly
audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax
assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes.
The Company believes that its tax return positions comply with applicable tax
law and that it has adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable assessments
of additional taxes. Additionally, the Company believes that any assessments in


excess of the amounts
provided for will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

Share Repurchases

In January 2003, the
Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which allowed the
Company to repurchase up to $25,000 of the Company’s common stock from time to
time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In June and
August 2005, the Company repurchased 925,341 shares of common stock at an
aggregate cost of $24,929. All shares repurchased were retired in August 2005.

In July 2005, the
Company modified a stock compensation arrangement and accepted for return
412,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, held by three employees with a
fair market value at the original issuance date of approximately $9,350, for
cash bonuses payable in the future. At the date of modification, 366,667 shares
were fully vested and $8,311 of compensation expense had been previously
recognized. The remaining unvested shares were forfeited and the additional
compensation expense of future cash bonuses of $1,039 has been recognized
ratably as expense through February 2006. In October 2005, 412,500
common shares under this arrangement were retired.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has the
following stock-based compensation plans:

Incentive Stock Plan.

The Company has adopted an Incentive Stock Plan (“Incentive
Plan”). The Incentive Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock, deferred
stock and other stock-based awards of the Company’s common stock to directors,
officers and other employees of the Company. The Incentive Plan is administered
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In June 2005, the
stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate amount of shares to
2,500,000 shares from 1,500,000 shares.

Restricted stock awards
are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which typically
ranges from one to four years. As of October 31, 2006, the total future
unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to
outstanding unvested restricted stock is approximately $18,000 and will be
recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining
vesting period, which is through fiscal year ended October 31, 2009. The
Company recognized $8,604 of stock-based compensation related to its restricted
stock awards for the year ended October 31, 2006.

Stock
Option Plans.

In June 2002,
the stockholders of the Company approved the Company’s 2002 Stock Option Plan,
as previously adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “2002 Plan”),
pursuant to which officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company
may receive stock options to purchase


shares of Common Stock. In June 2005, the
stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate amount of shares to
11,000,000 shares from 9,000,000 shares. As of October 31, 2006, there are
approximately 2,300,000 shares available for grant under the 2002 Plan.

In January 1997, the stockholders of the Company
approved the Company’s 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, as previously
adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “1997 Plan”), pursuant to
which officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company may receive
options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock. As of October 31, 2006, there are no options available for
grant under the 1997 Plan.

Subject to the provisions of the plans, the Board of
Directors or any Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, has the
authority to determine the individuals to whom the stock options are to be
granted, the number of shares to be covered by each option, the option price, the
type of option, the option period, restrictions, if any, on the exercise of the
option, the terms for the payment of the option price and other terms and
conditions.

As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, there were
outstanding stock options granted under the Company’s stock option plans to
purchase in the aggregate 5,129,000 and 6,691,000 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock, respectively, vesting at various times from 2007 to 2009 and
expiring at various times from 2007 to 2011. Options granted generally vest
over a period of three to five years.

As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, there are
non-plan stock options outstanding for an aggregate of 673,000 and 804,000
shares of the Company’s Common Stock, respectively. The non-plan stock options
outstanding at October 31, 2006 vest in 2007 and expire at various times
from 2007 to 2009.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company, in granting
options, was found in many cases not to be in compliance with the terms of its
stock option plans.

As of October 31, 2006, due to the Company’s
stock price, there is no aggregate intrinsic value related to options
outstanding or exercisable and the total future unrecognized compensation cost,
net of estimated forfeitures, related to outstanding unvested options is
approximately $18,500, which will be recognized as compensation expense, on a
straight-line basis, over the remaining vesting periods through 2009. The
Company recognized $12,064 of stock-based compensation related to its stock
option awards for the year ended October 31, 2006.  The weighted average exercise price of stock
options expected to vest at October 31, 2006 is $22.05.

The fair value of
the Company’s stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. This model requires the input of assumptions regarding a number of
complex and subjective variables that will usually have a significant impact on
the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the
volatility of the Company’s stock price and employee stock option exercise
behavior. The assumptions and variables used for the current period grants were
developed based on SFAS 123(R) and SEC guidance contained in Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment.” The following
table summarizes the assumptions and variables used by the Company to compute
the weighted average fair value of stock option grants:

For the year ended October 31, 2006, the Company
used a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility for publicly
traded options on the Company’s stock as the expected volatility assumption
required in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model consistent with SFAS 123(R) and
SAB 107. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company had used its historical stock price
volatility in accordance with SFAS 123 for purposes of its pro forma
information. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon
the availability of actively traded options on the Company’s stock and the
Company’s assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future
stock price trends than historical volatility.

SFAS 123(R) requires the recognition of stock-based
compensation for the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As
a result, for most awards, recognized stock compensation was reduced for
estimated forfeitures prior to vesting primarily based on a historical annual
forfeiture rate of approximately 7%. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed
at each balance sheet date and may change based on new facts and circumstances.
Prior to October 31, 2005, actual forfeitures were accounted for as they
occurred for purposes of required pro forma stock compensation disclosures.


For
the years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, had the compensation cost for
the Company’s stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123(R), the
Company’s net income and net income per share would have been adjusted to the
restated pro forma amounts indicated below:

The Company’s restatement
of stock-based compensation expense, as discussed in Note 2, and the
related impact that the re-measurement of stock-option awards had on previously
reported “expected term until exercise”, as disclosed above, reduced previously
reported pro forma net income by $2,915 and $6,544 in 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

sale of third-party software titles, accessories and hardware to retail outlets
in North America. Generally, publishing activities generate higher margins than
distribution activities, with sales of PC software titles resulting in higher
margins than sales of products designed for video game consoles and handheld
platforms.

The Company’s chief operating decision maker is
considered to be the Chief Executive Officer (“CODM”). The Company continues to
be centrally managed and the chief operating decision maker primarily uses
consolidated financial information supplemented by sales information by product
category, major product title and platform for making operational decisions and
assessing financial performance.

The CODM also reviews and assesses performance of each
operating segment based on gross margin. Gross margin is defined as revenue,
less costs of goods sold.

Beginning February 1,
2006, the Company’s chief operating decision maker began receiving financial
information that contains additional information that separately identifies the
Company’s publishing and distribution activities, including gross margin
information. Accordingly, the Company currently considers its publishing and
distribution activities as two separate reportable segments. The Company has
revised prior period financial information to reflect this change and to
conform to current year presentation.


The Company’s operating segments do not record
inter-segment revenue and therefore none has been reported. The Company does
not allocate operating expenses, interest and other income, interest expense or
income taxes to operating segments. The Company’s accounting policies for
segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

17.   QUARTERLY
FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

The following tables set forth quarterly supplementary
data for each of the years in the two-year period ended October 31, 2006.
The Company’s restatement, as described in Note 2, did not have a material impact
on the Company’s 2006 statements of operations. Amounts related to the Company’s
first and second fiscal quarters of 2006 were recorded in the third fiscal
quarter of 2006 due to their immateriality and therefore, the Company’s
previously reported 2006 quarterly results have not been restated.

See
the reconciliation of the Company’s 2005 quarterly statements of operations
below, which were restated for the matters discussed in Note 2.

(2)

In
the second quarter of 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling
$24,421 to the write-off capitalized software costs related to discontinued
software titles, trademarks and other assets. In addition, the Company recorded
charges of $1,964 related to severance costs and lease abandonment in second
quarter of 2006.

(3)

In
the third quarter 2005, net revenue and gross profit were reduced by estimated
provisions of approximately $32.6 million and $29.6 million, respectively,
primarily due to additional product returns and processing costs as a result of
the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (“ESRB”) in July 2005.
In the 4

th

quarter 2005, the provisions were reduced due
to better than expected sell-through of the product and lower processing costs
which increased 4

th

quarter net revenue and gross profit by $8.2
million and $7.8 million, respectively.

(4)

The
Company recorded the following expenses in the third quarter of 2006:

a.

$8,080
to write-down the goodwill and fixed assets of its Joytech subsidiary, a
manufacturer of video game accessories and peripherals.

b.

$5,227
for the impairment of software development costs and record charges for
severance and office abandonment.

c.

Approximately
$900 of stock-based compensation expenses related to the stock option investigation
performed by the Special Committee.

d.

Approximately
$59,500 to reduce income tax benefits due to uncertainty surrounding the
realizability of such deferred tax assets.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed
independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of
quarterly basic and diluted earnings per share information may not equal annual
basic and diluted earnings per share.
