PART I

Item 1.    Business

General

We are a global publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our publishing segment consists of our Rockstar Games, 2K
Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play publishing labels. We develop, market and publish software titles for the leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms, including Sony's
PLAYSTATION®3 ("PS3") and PlayStation®2 ("PS2") computer entertainment systems; Sony's PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) ("PSP") system;
Microsoft's Xbox 360® ("Xbox 360") and Xbox® ("Xbox") video game and entertainment systems; Nintendo's Wii™ ("Wii"), GameCube™, DS™
("DS") and Game Boy® Advance ("GBA"); and for the PC and Games for Windows®. Our distribution segment, which includes our Jack of All Games subsidiary, distributes our
products as well as software, hardware and accessories produced by others to retail outlets in North America. We have pursued a strategy of capitalizing on the widespread market acceptance of
interactive entertainment, as well as the growing
popularity of innovative action, sports and strategy games that appeal to the expanding demographic of video game players.

Expanding
gamer demographics have driven demand for interactive entertainment software in recent years, with video games becoming a mainstream entertainment choice for a maturing, sophisticated
audience. According to the Entertainment Software Association, U.S. computer and video game software sales grew six percent in 2006 to $7.4 billion—almost tripling industry
software sales since 1996. At least half of all Americans claim to play PC and video games, with an estimated 67% of heads of households playing games. The average game player is 33 years old
and has been playing for nearly 12 years. The International Development Group, a consulting and market research firm, estimates that sales of PC, console and handheld games (excluding wireless
applications) will be $8.5 billion in 2007 in North America and estimates that such sales will reach $9.4 billion in 2008.

The
video game industry is cyclical and the installed base of hardware platforms has historically had a significant effect on the demand for gaming software. The prior-generation of console platforms
includes the PS2, Xbox and GameCube ("prior-generation") and the next-generation of console platforms includes the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii ("next-generation"). In 2007, demand
for prior-generation gaming software began to diminish as consumers continued to upgrade to the latest generation of hardware platforms. Additionally, the introduction of new hardware platforms has,
in many cases, been characterized by delays in launch dates or reductions in launch quantities or both. Each of these circumstances had a significant financial impact on us. In addition, these
next-generation consoles are more complex than their predecessors, and in some cases contain multi-processor technology, new and unique game controllers, online gameplay functionality and
high definition video capabilities, which in turn require video game developers to create games that are progressively more elaborate and costly to develop.

Transition
periods also mark a shift in the software development process for next-generation gaming systems. During console transition periods, software publishers and developers often
devote significant resources to producing next-generation software products for new gaming consoles, which have a limited installed hardware base. As a result, next-generation
software products often start out selling at relatively


low
unit volumes and the time required for software publishers to recognize a return on their investment is increased. Information concerning the global installed base for prior-generation,
next-generation and handheld platforms for 2004 through 2011 is as follows:

Strategy

Overview.

Our strategy is to capitalize on the growth of the interactive entertainment market, particularly the
expanding demographics of video game players, through a focus on creating premium quality games and successful franchises for which we can create sequels. We have established a portfolio of successful
proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of genres including action, adventure, strategy, role-playing, sports, racing, music, party and puzzle. We
believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength, allowing us to differentiate many of our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with
compelling story lines and characters to provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers. We have created, licensed and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands to match the variety of
consumer
demographics we aspire to serve, ranging from adults to children and hard-core game enthusiasts to casual gamers.

Support Multiple Labels to Target Distinct Market Segments.

We publish our titles under four separate labels:
Rockstar Games, 2K Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play, with each label focused on distinct product genres and target demographics. We expect Rockstar Games, the publisher of our blockbuster

Grand Theft Auto

and

Midnight Club

franchises, to continue to be a leader in the action product category
by leveraging our


existing
titles as well as developing new brands. We also anticipate that 2K Games, the publisher of the critically acclaimed

BioShock

title and

Civilization

series,
 will continue to develop new and successful franchises in the future. Our 2K Sports label, which publishes the

Major League Baseball 2K

,

NBA 2K

,

NHL 2K

and

College Hoops 2K

series, is intended to provide more consistent year over year revenue streams because we publish these titles on an annual basis. Our
recently launched 2K Play label, publisher of our successful

Carnival Games

title, is focused on the growing casual and family gaming market, and we
recently entered into a licensing agreement with Nickelodeon to publish games based on top rated Nick Jr. preschool television properties, including

Dora the
Explorer

and

Go, Diego, Go!.

Maximize Product Selection and Development.

Our primary strategy is to publish a select number of high quality
titles based on internally owned and developed intellectual property, which tends to offer higher margins than licensed products. We currently have over 15 proprietary brands which we expect to
leverage in the future. In addition, we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties, including sports, and also publish externally developed titles. We have recently implemented a
product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment, to review existing titles in development, and to review titles after their release to assess product performance. We
apply this process to all of our products, whether externally or internally developed. The product investment review process includes in-depth reviews of each project at various stages of
development by our executive management team and senior management of our publishing labels, and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of the title. This
disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles.

We
develop our products using a combination of our internal development resources and external development resources acting under contract with us. We typically select our external developers based on
their track record and expertise in producing products in the same category. One developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will produce sequels to the original game. We
believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which we believe adds to the
quality of our products.

Diversify Revenue by Title, Genre, Platform, and Target Demographic.

We believe the diversification of our product
mix will reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue. We expect to continue to
increase revenue in our sports business and offer a wider variety of titles for an expanded group of customers through the recent launch of our 2K Play label, focused on family and casual games. We
are also increasingly offering our titles on additional hardware platforms to take advantage of the increasing installed base of these platforms, including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3,
Wii, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and PC.

Improve Financial Performance.

We are seeking to return to profitability in fiscal 2008 through a combination of
our company-wide cost reduction program, the introduction of a greater number of internally owned and developed titles, the reduction of legal expenses and professional fees as we resolve
our outstanding regulatory and litigation issues, and the enhanced financial performance of our distribution business. We expect to improve financial performance in our sports business through a
combination of higher average retail price points as more of our titles are sold on next-generation platforms, increased unit sales, and the introduction of new titles, including
proprietary, non-licensed sports titles. We also expect to expand our low cost development capabilities in Asia.

Leverage Emerging Technologies.

The technological advances in our industry are leading to new revenue streams which
we are seeking to capitalize on. We see opportunities in a variety of areas, including episodic content, in-game advertising, micro-transactions and networked gameplay. We plan to release
episodic content for

Grand Theft Auto IV

on Xbox Live in fiscal 2008. We are currently including advertising in many of our sports titles. We also plan
to pursue opportunities that exist for networked gameplay, particularly for our wholly-owned franchises, as well as micro-transactions, where gamers can pay to download additional content to enhance
their game playing experience.


Expand International Business.

The global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow, and we seek to
increase our presence internationally, particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We typically distribute our products in Asia through license and royalty agreements with local
publishers. While we retain title to all intellectual property, local publishers are responsible for localization of software content, distribution and marketing of the products in their respective
local markets. We intend to build upon these relationships and establish new relationships to expand our international business.

Our Publishing and Software Development Businesses

The interactive software that we develop and publish is broken down into two major categories: 1) games developed by our internal development studios, and
2) games that we publish with, or market and distribute on behalf of, third party developers.

We
have internal development studios located in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Australia and China. As of October 31, 2007, we had a research and development staff of 1,178
employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major prior and next-generation consoles, handheld hardware platforms and PCs in several languages and
territories.

Agreements
with third party developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make advance royalty payments, pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy
other conditions. Royalty advances for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers. Our agreements with third party developers generally provide us with the
right to monitor development efforts and to cease making advance payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied. We also regularly monitor the level of advances in light of expected
sales for the related titles.

The
development cycle for our titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months. Although we often simultaneously develop our software for multiple platforms, in certain cases it can take
nine to 12 months to adapt a product for additional hardware platforms after initial development for one platform is completed. The cost to develop a front-line software product
generally ranges from $5 million to $20 million. We expect that development costs and time will continue to increase for next-generation platforms.

Rockstar Games.

Software titles published by our Rockstar Games label are primarily internally developed. Rockstar
Games is the publisher of our blockbuster

Grand Theft Auto

® franchise and is focused on creating premium content and groundbreaking
entertainment. We believe that Rockstar has established a uniquely original popular culture phenomenon with its

Grand Theft Auto

series and we have
taken advantage of its success by developing new proprietary brands as well as sequels to our existing titles. For the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our Grand Theft Auto titles
accounted for 13.1%, 22.4% and 38.2% of our total net revenue, respectively. No other products accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended October 31, 2007. Rockstar is also
well known for developing titles in multiple genres, such as

Midnight Club

,

Max Payne, Manhunt, Rockstar Games Presents Table
Tennis, The Warriors, Red Dead Revolver

and

Bully

.

We
expect our next iteration in the

Grand Theft Auto

series,

Grand Theft Auto IV,

to be released on the
Xbox 360 and PS3 platforms in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, Rockstar and Microsoft announced an agreement whereby Rockstar will publish episodic content for

Grand Theft Auto IV

exclusively on Xbox Live®, Microsoft's online entertainment and gaming network. The digitally delivered episodic
content will be available for purchase by Xbox Live subscribers, allowing them to expand their

Grand Theft Auto IV

gameplay experience. We believe that
online delivery of episodic content will continue to become more prevalent as broadband connectivity gains popularity and digital delivery platforms such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network and Valve's
Steam gain additional customers.

2K Games.

Most of our third party developed titles are published by our 2K Games label. 2K Games has actively
secured rights to publish popular entertainment properties, including

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,


The Darkness, Ghost Rider

and

Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.

While many of our 2K Games titles are developed by
third party developers, we also develop software titles for our 2K Games label through our internal development studios, such as

Sid Meier's Railroads!, Sid Meier's
Pirates!,

and the critically acclaimed, multi-million unit selling

BioShock

and

Civilization

franchises.

2K Sports.

We develop most of our 2K Sports software titles through our internal development studios including the

Major League Baseball
2K

series,

NBA 2K

series,

NHL 2K

series,

College Hoops 2K

series and our

Top Spin

tennis series. Since its formation, our 2K Sports label
has been actively securing major sports league licenses including long-term, third party exclusive licensing relationships with Major League Baseball Properties, the Major League Baseball
Players Association and Major League Baseball Advanced Media.

2K Play.

Our 2K Play label focuses on developing and publishing titles for the growing market for casual and
family-friendly games. While the majority of our 2K Play titles are developed by third party developers, we have also developed software titles for our 2K Play label internally, such as

Carnival Games

and the

Deal or No Deal

series. As part of our 2K Play initiative, we also announced an
expansive new handheld and console video game licensing agreement with Nickelodeon, a partnership involving top-rated properties including Nick Jr. preschool television hits,

Dora the Explorer

and

Go, Diego, Go!

.

Our Distribution Business

Through our distribution business, which primarily operates in North America and includes our Jack of All Games subsidiary, we supply retailers with our internally developed
products as well as software, hardware and accessories produced by others. We distribute third party console, handheld and PC products, consisting principally of newly released and popular software
titles, budget and catalog software titles, hardware and accessories.

Jack
of All Games seeks to capitalize on the growing installed base of hardware and the proliferation of software titles and outlets to purchase software. It has established a strong presence in the
budget segment of the business due to its expanding portfolio of value-priced products and its expertise in selling these titles. Jack of All Games continues to leverage this strategy by serving as
the distributor of our value-priced publishing products.

Intellectual Property

Our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, licensing and protection of intellectual property. Some of the intellectual property rights we have
created and acquired for our portfolio of brands are:

Grand Theft Auto, Midnight Club, Bully, Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis, Sid Meier's Civilization, Sid Meier's
Railroads!, Sid Meier's Pirates, The Darkness, Manhunt, Red Dead Revolver, Max Payne, Smuggler's Run, Spec Ops, BioShock, Top Spin, The Bigs, All-Pro Football, Carnival Games, Railroad
Tycoon and X-Com.

We believe that content ownership facilitates our internal product development efforts and maximizes profit potential. We attempt to protect our
software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Although we generally do not
hold any patents, we obtain trademark and copyright registrations for many of our products.

We
also enter into content license agreements, such as those with sports leagues and players associations, movie studios and performing talent, music labels and musicians. These licenses are typically
limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods. In addition, our products that play on game consoles and handhelds include technology that is owned by the console
manufacturer and licensed non-exclusively to us for use. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business and our ability to develop many of our products is dependent on
our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights at reasonable rates.


Interactive
entertainment software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our titles to obtain and use programming or
production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy operations have proliferated in recent years, resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of software over the
Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software, piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability.

As
the amount of interactive entertainment software in the market increases and the functionality of this software further overlaps, we believe that interactive entertainment software will
increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the copyrights or patents of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third
parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our titles and the titles and technologies of third party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual
relationships do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur. Any claims of infringement, with or
without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend. See "Item 1A.—Risk Factors."

Arrangements with Platform Manufacturers

We have entered into license agreements with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to develop and publish software in North America, Europe and Australia. We are not required to obtain
any licenses to develop titles for the PC.

Sony.

Under the terms of the license agreements that we have entered into, or will enter into, with Sony Computer
Entertainment, Inc., Sony granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the PS3, PS2 and PSP hardware platforms. The agreements require us to
submit products to Sony for approval and for us to make royalty payments to Sony based on the number of units manufactured. In addition, products for the PS3, PS2 and PSP are required to be
manufactured by Sony approved manufacturers.

Microsoft.

Under the terms of the license agreements that we have entered into with Microsoft Corporation and its
affiliates, Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the Xbox 360 and Xbox. The agreements require us to submit products to
Microsoft for approval and for us to make royalty payments to Microsoft based on the number of units manufactured. In addition, products for the Xbox 360 and Xbox are required to be
manufactured by Microsoft approved manufacturers.

We
expect to launch

Grand Theft Auto IV

on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, we expect
that our Rockstar subsidiary will offer exclusive episodic content for

Grand Theft Auto IV

on Xbox Live®, Microsoft's online
entertainment and gaming network. The digitally delivered episodic content will be available for purchase by Xbox Live subscribers, allowing them to expand their

Grand Theft
Auto IV

gameplay experience.

Nintendo.

Under the terms of the license agreements that we have entered into with Nintendo Co., Ltd. and
its affiliates, Nintendo granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software for Nintendo's Wii, GameCube, DS and GBA. The agreements require us to submit products to
Nintendo for approval and for us to make royalty payments to Nintendo based on the number of units manufactured. In addition, products for such platforms are required to be manufactured by Nintendo
approved manufacturers.

Manufacturing

Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft are the sole manufacturers, or control selection of manufacturers, of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms. We
place a purchase order for the


manufacture
of our products with Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft utilizing our payment terms with the manufacturer and then send software code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer, together
with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs for approval, defect testing and manufacture. Games are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of
our manufacturing order.

Production
of PC software is performed by third party vendors in accordance with our specifications and includes CD-ROM pressing, assembly of components, printing of packaging and user
manuals and shipping of finished goods. We send software code and a prototype of a title, together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs to the
manufacturers. Games are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order.

We
occasionally experience difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our titles; however such delays have not significantly harmed our business to date. We have not experienced material delays due
to manufacturing defects. Our software titles typically carry a 90-day limited warranty.

Sales

We sell software titles to retail outlets in North America and Europe through direct relationships with large retail customers and third party distributors. Our customers in
North America include leading mass merchandisers, such as Wal-Mart; specialty retailers, such as GameStop; video stores, such as Blockbuster; electronics stores, such as Best Buy and
Circuit City; toy stores, such as Toys "R" Us; national and regional drug stores; and supermarket and discount store chains. Our European customers include Carrefour, Dixons, Karstadt, and
Media Saturn. We have sales operations in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Sales
to our five largest customers in fiscal 2007 accounted for approximately 51.1% of our net revenue, with Wal-Mart, GameStop and Best Buy accounting for 15.1%, 12.8% and
11.5%, respectively, of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2007.

Marketing

Our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and broaden distribution of our titles, promote brand name recognition, assist retailers and properly
position, package and merchandise our titles.

We
market titles by:

•

Implementing
public relations campaigns, using print and online advertising, television, radio spots and outdoor advertising. We believe that we label and market our
products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or the ESRB, an independent self-regulatory body that assigns ratings and
enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry.

•

Actively
pursuing relationships with participants in the music and entertainment industries. We believe that the shared demographics between various media and some of the
software titles marketed by our publishing labels provide excellent cross-promotional opportunities. We continue to work with popular recording artists to create sophisticated game soundtracks, enter
into agreements to license high-profile names and likenesses, and make arrangements for co-branding opportunities.

•

Satisfying
certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for Sony's Greatest Hits Programs and Microsoft's
Platinum Hits


Program.
In connection with these programs, we receive manufacturing discounts from Sony and Microsoft. Similarly, Nintendo has also established a Player's Choice Program for the Wii and GameCube.

•

Stimulating
continued sales and maximizing profits by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product. Price
concessions may occur at any time in a product's life cycle, but typically occur three to nine months after a product's initial launch. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, price concessions to retailers
amounted to $68.1 million, $73.9 million and $30.4 million, respectively. In certain international markets, we provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales.

We
also employ various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness, including in-store promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail,
co-operative advertising, as well as attendance at trade shows. We employ separate sales forces for our publishing and distribution operations. As of October 31, 2007, we had a
sales and marketing staff of 229 people.

Our
front-line products generally sell at retail prices ranging from $19.99 to $59.99 in North America. Products that are designated Sony's Greatest Hits (for both the PlayStation 2 and
the PSP) and Microsoft's Platinum Hits (for Xbox) generally sell for $19.99. We release sports titles at retail prices ranging from $19.99 to $59.99, and we position our value-priced product offerings
at a retail price starting at $9.99.

Distribution

We distribute our own titles as well as software, hardware and accessories developed by others in North America through our Jack of All Games subsidiary, consisting principally
of newly released and popular software titles, budget and catalog software titles, and hardware for third party console, handheld and PC products. Our Jack of All Games subsidiary maintains warehouse
facilities and sales offices in Ohio and Ontario, Canada. Products arrive at our warehouses to be picked, packed and shipped to customers. We generally ship products by common carrier. Backlog is not
material to our business as we generally ship products within seven days after receipt of orders.

We
procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand, as well as pre-orders from retailers. We periodically enter into
agreements with our suppliers that provide exclusive distribution rights to certain products. We carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders.
We utilize electronic data interchange with many of our retailers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments.

Competition

In our publishing business, we compete with:

•

Other
forms of entertainment such as motion pictures, television and audio, online computer programs and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide
other advantages to consumers.

•

Companies
that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large companies with greater financial, marketing and technical personnel and
other resources than ours, such as Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ, Midway Games and Atari, and international companies, such as SEGA, Vivendi, Ubisoft, SCi Entertainment, Capcom, Konami and
Namco-Bandai.

•

Sony,
Microsoft and Nintendo, for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software, each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for
its own platforms. Each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns.


•

Other
software, hardware and entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources. The competition is intense among an increasing number of newly
introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

Competition
in the entertainment software industry is based on: product quality, features, innovation and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility with popular platforms; access to
distribution channels; price; marketing; and customer service. Our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing. Competition for our titles is
influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sell-through of our
titles at retail stores.

In
our distribution business, we compete with large national companies as well as smaller regional distributors. We also compete with the efforts of the major entertainment software companies that
distribute directly to retailers or over the Internet. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do and are able to carry larger inventories,
adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more comprehensive product selection than we can.

International Operations

Sales in international markets, principally in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. For fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, approximately 31.3%, 39.4% and 39.8%, respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased
credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a
significant impact on our operating results. See Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Information

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our reportable segments.

Employees

As of October 31, 2007, we had approximately 1,900 full-time employees, of which approximately 877 were employed outside of the United States. None of our
employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.


Item 1A.    Risk Factors

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as
other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and
financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline.

We have experienced significant turnover in our Board and executive management and have a new business development plan.

During the second quarter of 2007, five new members and one incumbent director were elected to our Board at our annual meeting. Our Board then elected a new Chairman and a new
Chief Executive Officer, and also appointed one additional incumbent member and one additional new member to our Board, for a total of eight board members. During the quarter we also engaged
ZelnickMedia, a media investment and management firm, to provide us with executive management services. The Board and ZelnickMedia reorganized our executive management team and our business in fiscal
2007. It is not yet possible to accurately assess how effective our new management team will be, whether it will be able to accomplish the objectives of our new business development plan or whether
our business reorganization plan, if successful, will be of significant benefit to us and our financial performance. In addition, the success of our business plan depends in part on events and
circumstances that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, consumer demand for our products and other factors affecting our industry. The changes that are part of our business
reorganization may be disruptive to our business.

We depend on our key management and product development personnel.

Our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with ZelnickMedia. In 2007, we entered into an agreement with
ZelnickMedia whereby it has agreed to provide executive management services to us and our Board through October 31, 2011. Our Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer are partners of
ZelnickMedia. We are also highly dependent on the expertise, skills and knowledge of certain of our Rockstar employees responsible for content creation and development of

Grand
Theft Auto

and other titles. Although we have employment
agreements with our key Rockstar employees, we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels, or at all. The compensation arrangements with these Rockstar
employees could result in increased expenses and have a negative impact on our operating results.

The
loss of the services of our executive officers, ZelnickMedia or our key Rockstar employees could significantly harm our business. In addition, if one or more key employees join a competitor or
form a competing company, we may lose additional personnel, experience material interruptions in product development, delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships
with licensors, suppliers and customers, which could significantly harm our business. Failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect
our business and prospects.

We are dependent on the future success of our Grand Theft Auto products and we must continue to publish "hit" titles in order to compete successfully in
our industry.

Grand Theft Auto

and certain of our other titles are "hit" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of
our revenue. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our "hit"
titles, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses. For the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our

Grand Theft
Auto

titles accounted for 13.1%, 22.4% and 38.2% of our net revenue, respectively, and our 10 best selling titles accounted for approximately 26.6%,


38.4%
and 48.2% of our net revenue, respectively. In addition, competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our
industry. Hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our products and services to fall below our
expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value (such as
pay-for-play or subscription-based models), or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and well-received products and services, our revenue and
profitability will decline.

Our business is highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms, as well as our ability to develop
commercially successful products for these platforms.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PSP and
Microsoft's
Xbox and Xbox 360. The success of our business is dependent in large part upon the success and availability of an adequate supply of next-generation video game platforms and hardware
systems, our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace, and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms. We must make product
development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. A new platform for which we are developing products may not succeed or may
have a shorter life cycle than anticipated. Alternatively, a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we had initially anticipated, causing us to miss
a meaningful revenue opportunity. If the platforms for which we are developing products do not attain wide market acceptance, our revenue will suffer, we may be unable to fully recover the investments
we have made in developing our products, and our financial performance will be harmed.

We expect the average price of our prior-generation software titles to continue to decline.

The interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards.
Consumer demand for software for prior-generation platforms has declined as newer and more advanced hardware platforms achieve market acceptance. As the gaming software industry transitions to
next-generation platforms, we expect few, if any, prior-generation titles will be able to command premium prices and we expect that these titles will be subject to price reductions earlier
in their product life cycles than we experienced in prior years. As a result, we have reduced prices for our prior-generation software titles and we expect to continue to reduce prices for such
software titles, which will have a negative impact on our operating results. These changes may cause the value of our inventory to decline substantially or to become obsolete.

The market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles. Delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of
our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

The market for video games is characterized by short product lives and frequent introductions of new products. New products may not achieve significant market acceptance or
generate sufficient sales to permit us to recover development, manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products. The life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of
sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the
total revenue associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations.


Our distribution business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis.

Our ability to obtain particular products in required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is important to the success of our distribution business. In
most cases, we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with suppliers. Our distribution business has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant supply shortages from time to
time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to supply products, such as the newest generation of platforms, on a timely basis. Further, manufacturers or publishers that currently distribute
their products through us may decide to distribute, or to substantially increase their existing distribution, through other distributors, or directly to retailers. If we cannot obtain sufficient
supplies of the products that we distribute, our net revenue will decline and we could incur losses.

We may need to raise additional capital if we continue to incur losses.

We incurred significant losses in the years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, and we may continue to incur losses. If losses continue, we may be required to raise
additional capital in order to fund our operations. We could seek to raise capital in a number of ways, including through the issuance of debt or equity, or through other financing arrangements.
During the year ended October 31, 2007, we entered into a senior secured line of credit agreement, which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments. If we were to
borrow additional funds, it is likely that further debt service payments would be necessary. In addition, the terms of additional debt may impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our
business. If we seek financing through the sale of equity securities, our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock. We cannot be certain as to our
ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available. If we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so, we will have to consider other options
that may include, but are not limited to, a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development, reductions in overhead expenses, and sales of intellectual property and
other assets. These actions, should they become necessary, will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business.

Our involvement, and the involvement of some of our former executive officers in a wide variety of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings has had, and
may in the future have, a material adverse effect on us.

We and some of our former officers, directors and employees have been, and are subject to, a wide variety of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including the following:

Former Officers.

Our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pled guilty to two felony counts relating to our historical stock option
granting practices and the Securities and Exchange Commission instituted a civil action against him. In addition, certain other former officers have been convicted of crimes relating to their conduct
during their employment with us.

Stock Option Granting Practices.

In 2006, a Special Committee of our Board of Directors conducted an investigation into our historical
stock option granting practices. The Special Committee determined that there were improprieties in the process of granting and documenting stock options and that incorrect measurement dates for some
stock option grants had been used for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with respect to
some of our stock-based awards and restated certain previously filed financial information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.
Several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and federal courts against some of our current and former directors and some of our former executive officers
relating to our historical stock option granting practices.


FTC Consent Order.

We have entered into an agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission containing a consent order that
requires us to maintain a comprehensive system reasonably designed to ensure that all content in our electronic games is considered and reviewed in preparing submissions to a U.S. rating agency. We
have also agreed to represent accurately the rating and content description for games we publish and to disclose to consumers the presence of any content relevant to the rating that was not disclosed
to the rating authority.

Personal Injury Actions.

We are named as a defendant in a number of personal injury and wrongful death actions.

SEC Investigation.

We have received a notice from the SEC that it is conducting a formal investigation into certain stock option grants
made by us. We have also received a "Wells" notice informing us of the SEC's intention to file charges and seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with this investigation.

IRS Request for Information.

We have received a request for information from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the granting and
exercise of certain stock options and tax deductions taken by us with respect thereto.

Other Inquiries and Proceedings.

We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York and from
certain state attorneys general relating to some of our products, our historical stock option granting practices, the termination of our former auditors and other matters.

The
investigations and charges against us or other current or former officers, directors or employees have imposed, and are likely to continue to impose, significant costs on us both financially and
as a result of the distraction of our management team. While we are unable to estimate the exact nature or amount of these future costs, we believe they will likely include:

•

damage
to our reputation and business relationships;

•

professional
fees in connection with the conduct of the investigations and the defense of related litigations and other proceedings;

•

potential
damages, fines, penalties or settlement costs imposed on us;

•

advancement
of certain expenses and reimbursement of certain amounts payable by, or on behalf of, our current and former officers, directors and employees subject to the
investigation or named in any litigations or other proceedings pursuant to our indemnification obligations; and

•

potential
impairment of our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement under existing insurance policies, and a potentially negative impact on our future insurance
coverage.

•

potential
impairment on our ability to raise capital, debt and equity

Our ability to acquire licenses to intellectual property, especially for sports titles, impacts our revenue and profitability. Competition for these
licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. For example, our 2K Sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues
and players' associations. Similarly, some of our other titles are based on key film and television licenses. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these licenses or
obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value, our revenue and profitability will decline significantly. Competition for these licenses may also increase
the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.


Our business is dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties.

Our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis. We rely on third party software developers for the development of some of
our titles. Quality third party developers are continually in high demand. Software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the
future. Due to the limited number of third party software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them, these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or
within acceptable quality standards, if at all. We have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use
licensed intellectual properties in our titles. These agreements typically require us to make advance payments, pay royalties and satisfy other conditions. Our advance payments may not be sufficient
to permit developers to develop new software successfully, which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market. Software development
costs, promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and third party licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from
sales of our software. Future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers and licensors, and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy
our contractual commitments to such developers. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with third party developers and licensors, the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways
that are burdensome to us, and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results.

We are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs, and we must adapt to changes in software technologies.

We depend on third party software developers and our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and
cost projections. The development cycle for new titles ranges from 12 to 24 months. Development times and costs of next-generation software have increased substantially as a result of the
additional and enhanced features available in the newest games. After development of a product, it may take between nine to 12 additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms. If
developers experience financial difficulties, additional costs or unanticipated development delays, we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs. Certain of
our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon software release dates. There can be no assurance that the products so
developed will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products.

Additionally,
in order to stay competitive, our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development. Any inability to respond to
technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable.

The interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive both for our publishing and distribution operations.

We compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which is a large developer and marketer
of software for its own platforms. We also compete with domestic game publishers, such as Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ, Midway Games and Atari and international publishers, such as SEGA, Vivendi,
Ubisoft, SCi Entertainment, Capcom, Konami and Namco-Bandai. As our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing, the
availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel
and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers


for
commercially desirable properties. Our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products featuring similar themes, online
computer programs and other entertainment, which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

Our
distribution business also operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is based primarily on breadth, availability and quality of product lines; price; terms and conditions of sale;
credit terms and availability; speed and accuracy of delivery; and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs. Our competitors include regional, national and international distributors, as well as
hardware manufacturers and software publishers. We may lose market share or be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to our competitors. Our distribution business has been adversely
affected by lower sales volume of software titles, a decrease in average selling prices of interactive entertainment products as our industry transitions to next-generation technology and
increased competition in the value software market.

A
number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet. If technological advances
significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially, it could result in a decline in our platform-based software sales and
negatively impact sales of our products.

Increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur
greater expenses to market our titles.

Retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of
shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our
titles. Competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able, or we may have to pay more than our
competitors, to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space.

A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business.

A substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers. Sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 51.1%, 49.4% and 40.7% of
our net revenue, for the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with Wal-Mart, GameStop and Best Buy accounting for 15.1%, 12.8% and 11.5%, respectively, of such
net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2007. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long-term agreements or other commitments, and our customers may
terminate their relationship with us at any time. Certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content. The loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline
in sales to principal customers, including as a result of a product being rated "AO" (age 18 and over), could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Bankruptcies or
consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business.

Returns of our products by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers. Our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the
right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers, which
include credits and returns, when demand for specific products falls below expectations. We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is
recognized after deducting estimated reserves


for
returns and price concessions. While we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions, if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves, our
revenue could decline.

We submit our products for rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in the United States and other voluntary or government ratings
organizations in foreign countries. Failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively impact our ability to distribute and sell those games, as could the
re-rating of a game for any reason.

We voluntarily submit our game products to the ESRB, a U.S.-based non-profit and independent ratings organization. The ESRB system provides consumers with
information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors, such as graphic violence, profanity or sexually explicit
material. The ESRB may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules on rating or marketing a game, including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to a million
dollars. Other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. We believe that we comply with rating system requirements and properly
display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions. In some instances, we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating, which could delay or disrupt the
release of our products. For example, during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, our release of

Manhunt 2

was denied a rating certification
by the British Board of Film Classification, the agency responsible for film and video game ratings in the United Kingdom. That decision was recently overturned by the British Video Appeals Committee,
but the initial denial delayed the expected launch of

Manhunt 2.

In addition, some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in
certain countries, such as Germany. In the United States, we develop software titles that we intend to receive ESRB ratings of "E" (age 6 and older), "E10+" (age 10 and older), "T" (age 13 and older)
or "M" (age 17 and older). In addition to these ratings, the ESRB may also rate a game as "AO" (age 18 and older). Platform holders may not certify a game rated "AO" and retailers may refuse to sell
"AO" games or games with controversial content. For instance, in 2007, some retailers reacted to the controversy over

Manhunt 2

by refusing to sell it
or refusing to sell it in brick and mortar stores. In addition, some consumers have reacted to
re-ratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased, and refraining from buying other games published
by us.

We
have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the ESRB and other ratings organizations. Nonetheless, these processes are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding and
reasonable resource constraints. If a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content, the ESRB could re-rate a game, retailers could refuse to sell it and
demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers, and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money. This could have a material negative impact
on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be exposed to litigation, administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed, which could impact sales of other
video games we sell. If any of these consequences were to occur, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed.

Many
of our Rockstar titles and certain of our 2K Games titles have been rated "M" by the ESRB. If we are unable to obtain "M" ratings as a result of changes in the ESRB's ratings standards or for
other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected. If any of our games are re-rated by the ESRB or other foreign
based ratings organizations, we could be exposed to litigation, administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities, and our operating results and financial condition could be
significantly impacted.


Our business and products are subject to potential legislation. The adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our
products.

Several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry, including a Senate bill, referred to as The Family Entertainment Protection Act. This bill
prohibits the sale of "M" rated, "AO" rated and "Rating Pending" products to under-17 audiences (while the ESRB rating recommends an appropriate age group, there is currently no legal
prohibition on any game sales). If the bill is enacted into law, it may limit the potential market for our "M" rated products, and adversely affect our operating results. Other countries, such as
Germany, have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, proposals have
also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate the sale of "M" or "AO" rated products and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of
violence or sexual materials to under 17 or 18 audiences. While such legislation to date has been successfully enjoined by industry and retail groups, the adoption into law of such legislation in
federal and/or in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for our "M" rated titles.

Content policies adopted by retailers, consumer opposition and litigation could negatively impact sales of our products.

Retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem
inappropriate for their businesses. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other
objectionable content generally, or if any of our previously "M" rated series products are rated "AO," we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series, which in
the case of our best selling

Grand Theft Auto

titles could seriously hurt our business. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive
entertainment software containing objectionable themes, violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations
and media campaigns. Additionally, although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have been unsuccessful in the courts, claims of this
kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future. See "Item 3.—Legal Proceedings."

We cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors.

We are required to obtain licenses from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, which are also our competitors, to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms. Our
existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title-by-title basis. As a result, the number of titles we are able to publish
for these hardware platforms, our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and, accordingly, our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms, may be limited. If a licensor
chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term, or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason, we would be unable to publish additional titles for
that licensor's platform. Termination of any such agreements could seriously hurt our business and prospects.

Certain
platform licensors have retained the right to change fee structures for online gameplay, and each licensor's ability to set royalty rates makes it difficult for us to forecast our costs.
Increased costs could negatively impact our operating margins. We may be unable to enter into license agreements for certain next-generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all.
Failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business.


Our quarterly operating results are highly seasonal and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our stock price to decline.

We have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results. The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales
typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters), due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday buying season. Our failure or inability to
introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results. The uncertainties associated with software development,
manufacturing lead times, production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship
and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations.

We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights or avoid claims that we infringe the proprietary rights of others.

We develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our software and production
techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized
copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy
operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our
software, piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability.

With
advances in technology, game content and software graphics are expected to continue to become more realistic. As a result, we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly
become the subject of claims that such software infringes the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties
alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third party developers and publishers with whom we have
contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur. Any claims of infringement, with
or without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend. Moreover, intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products, obtain a
license or redesign our products, which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays.

Our software is susceptible to errors, which can harm our financial results and reputation.

The technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products. As software products become more complex, the risk of
undetected errors in new products increases. If, despite testing, errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made, we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market
acceptance, product returns, loss of revenue and damage to our reputation.

Gross margins relating to our distribution business have been historically narrow, which increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating
results.

As a result of intense price competition, our gross margins in our distribution business have historically been narrow and may continue to be narrow in the future. Accordingly,
slight variations in operating costs and expenses could result in losses in our distribution business from period to period.


We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is attributable to expenses for personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in
revenue, we may not be able to dispose of facilities, reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit
costs. Management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit. Moreover, reducing costs may impair our ability to
produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade, including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar.

Sales in international markets, primarily in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales in international markets accounted for approximately
31.3%, 39.4% and 39.8%, respectively, of our net revenue for the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including
increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays, and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a
significant impact on our operating results. All of our international sales are made in local currencies, which could fluctuate against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts to a
limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Various lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations are pending involving us and certain of our subsidiaries as described below in this section. In accordance with SFAS
No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, we record accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition to the matters described herein, we are involved, or may become involved, in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business, which in our
opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Consumer Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

In July 2005, we received four complaints for purported class
actions. Two of the four complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, one was filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, and one was filed in the Circuit Court in St. Clair County, Illinois. The plaintiffs, alleged purchasers of our

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

game, assert that we engaged in consumer deception, false advertising and breached an implied warranty of merchantability and were unjustly enriched as a result of our
alleged failure to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained "hidden" content, which resulted in the game receiving a Mature 17+ ("M")
rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or the ESRB, rather than an Adults Only 18+ ("AO") rating. The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of various violations of law and
litigation costs.

In
November 2007, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted preliminary approval to a settlement of the foregoing consumer class action lawsuits. If the
proposed settlement receives final approval from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, all claims in these lawsuits will be dismissed without any admission of
liability or wrongdoing by us. We have committed to spend at least $1,025,000 on settlement benefits, and the settlement generally caps the defendants' out-of-pocket costs at
no more than $2,750,000, in addition to the costs of providing notice to class members and paying a fee to plaintiffs' counsel. We have established a reserve sufficient to cover the expected cost of
this settlement and related expenses.

City of Los Angeles Consumer Litigation.

In January 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court
of the State of California alleging violations of California law on substantially the same basis as the consumer class action regarding

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

. The state court actions were removed to federal court (a motion to remand filed by the City of Los Angeles is pending) and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferred all the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which consolidated them under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video
Game Consumer Litigation (No. II), 06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD)

. The plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking certification of a nationwide class, which
motion is pending. The parties have engaged in settlement discussions.

Securities Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Option Backdating.

In February and March 2006, four purported
class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints alleged that we
violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a), as well as Rule 10b-5, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making untrue statements or failing to disclose in certain press releases and
periodic reports filed with the SEC that, among other things,

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained "hidden" content which should have resulted in the
game receiving an "AO" rating from the ESRB rather than an "M" rating. The actions were consolidated under the name

In re Take-Two Interactive Securities
Litigation

, No. 1:06-cv-00803 (SWK), and a lead plaintiff was appointed. In September 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated
amended complaint, which included claims relating to

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

and to the


backdating
of stock options. On April 16, 2007, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated second amended complaint, which included additional allegations based on an investigation of options
backdating conducted by the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors and the Company's restatement of financial statements relating to options backdating. This complaint was filed
against us, our former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our former Chairman of the Board, two of our directors and one former director, our Rockstar Games subsidiary, and
one officer and one former officer of our Rockstar Games subsidiary. On June 25, 2007, we and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated second amended complaint. Plaintiffs
filed their opposition to these motions to dismiss on September 4, 2007, and reply briefs were filed on October 4, 2007. Now that briefing on the motions to dismiss is complete, we are
awaiting a decision by the Court.

St. Clair Derivative Action.

In January 2006, the St. Clair Shores General Employees Retirement System filed a purported class and
derivative action complaint in the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and directors,

St.
Clair Shores Gen. Employees Retirement System v. Eibeler

, no. 1:06-cv-0688 (SWK). The factual allegations in this action are similar to those in

In re Take-Two Interactive Securities
Litigation

. The plaintiff asserts that certain defendants breached their fiduciary duty by selling
their stock while in possession of certain material non-public information and that we violated Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 of the Exchange Act by failing to
disclose material facts in our 2003, 2004 and 2005 proxy statements in which we solicited approval to increase share availability under our 2002 Stock Option Plan. The plaintiff seeks the return of
all profits from the alleged insider trading conducted by the individual defendants who sold our stock, unspecified compensatory damages with interest and its costs in the action. In
October 2006, the court issued a stay of proceedings pending an investigation by the Special Litigation Committee. Following the conclusion of that investigation, on March 23, 2007, the
Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the complaint based on, among other things, the Committee's conclusion that "future pursuit of this action is not in the best interests of
Take-Two or its shareholders." The plaintiff subsequently conducted discovery concerning the Special Litigation Committee's motion to dismiss. On August 24, 2007, the plaintiff
filed an Amended Derivative and Class Action Complaint. The Amended Derivative and Class Action Complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection
with the issuance of proxy statements in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. On September 24, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint or to consolidate
certain of its claims with

In re Take-Two Interactive Securities Litigation

.

Derivative Action—Option Backdating.

In July and August 2006, Richard Lasky and Raeda Karadsheh filed purported
derivative action complaints in the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and directors. The complaints alleged
violations of federal and state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment in connection with the granting of
certain of our stock options. The complaints sought unspecified damages against all of the individual defendants, reimbursement from certain of the defendants of bonuses or other incentive or
equity-based compensation paid to them, equitable and other relief relating to the proceeds from certain of the defendants' alleged improper trading activity in our stock, adoption of certain
corporate governance proposals and recovery of litigation costs. The Lasky and Karadsheh actions were consolidated in November 2006 under the name

In re
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. Derivative Litigation

, no. 1:06-cv-05279 (LTS). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated
complaint on January 22, 2007, which focuses exclusively on our historical stock option granting practices. These matters were referred to the Special Litigation Committee. On
September 7, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss certain parties from the litigation and to have any claims against the remaining parties be assigned to us for disposition
by our management and Board of Directors. The plaintiffs have sought discovery concerning the Committee's recommendation, and the briefing of the motion is expected to be completed in
February 2008.


Strickland et al. Personal Injury Action.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of the Estates of Arnold Strickland, James
Crump and Ace Mealer brought an action in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against the Company, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc., Sony Corporation of America,
Wal-Mart, GameStop and Devin Moore, alleging under Alabama's manufacturers' liability and wrongful death statutes, that our video games designed, manufactured, marketed and/or supplied to
Mr. Moore resulted in "copycat violence" that caused the death of Messrs. Strickland, Crump and Mealer. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants
in excess of $600,000,000. Our motion to dismiss the action on the merits was denied. An accompanying motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied by the trial court, and the Alabama
Supreme Court subsequently rejected a petition for writ of mandamus on that issue. In April 2006, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add a claim for civil conspiracy; the Company moved to
dismiss that claim and the motion is pending. Under the most recent amended scheduling order, all fact and expert discovery was to have been completed by June 15, 2007, with a mediation on
November 8, 2007 and trial, if necessary, to commence no earlier than January 18, 2008. Due to issues that arose in expert discovery, however, the amended scheduling order was suspended.
The case is currently stayed until mid-January 2008 to permit the Plaintiffs to obtain new lead counsel. There currently is no Scheduling Order in effect. We believe that the claims
are without merit and that this action is similar to lawsuits brought and uniformly dismissed by courts in other jurisdictions.

Posey and Schmid Personal Injury Action.

In September 2006, personal representatives of the estate of Delbert and Tyrone Posey and
Marilea Schmid brought an action against us, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. and Sony Corporation of America and Cody Posey in the Second Judicial District Court of Bernalillo County,
New Mexico, alleging that

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

resulted in "copycat" violence that caused the deaths of the above named individuals. The suit
seeks damages
(including punitive damages) against all of the defendants. Both Sony entities have tendered their defense and requested indemnification from us, and we have accepted such tender. We received copies
of the complaint and summonses in December 2006, and moved to dismiss the complaint in January 2007 for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs
opposed the motions and requested jurisdictional discovery. The court heard argument on the motions on December 18, 2007, and granted such motions in their entirety, thus dismissing the
complaint against us and the Sony defendants. It is expected that the court will enter an order of dismissal in early January 2008, upon which plaintiffs will have thirty days to appeal.

We
intend to vigorously defend all of the above matters and, with respect to the derivative actions, we have been advised that the individual defendants will vigorously defend such actions. However,
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and, if determined adversely to us, such matters, either singly or in the aggregate, could result in the imposition of significant judgments, fines
and/or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Grand Jury Subpoenas.

We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting production
of documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including those relating to, among other things: the so-called "Hot Coffee" scenes in

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

; the work of
our Board of Directors, all Board Committees, and the Special Litigation Committee; certain acquisitions
entered into by us; billing and payment records relating to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the termination of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our auditors; communications to financial analysts and
stockholders about acquisitions and financial results; compensation and human resources documents of certain of our directors and employees and former directors and employees; stock-based
compensation; the SEC's July 2006 inquiry; legal services performed for employees; corporate credit card and expense records of certain individuals; the SEC bar of our former Chief Executive
Officer, Ryan Brant; the resolution to amend our Incentive Stock Plan; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies and questionnaires. We fully cooperated and provided the documents and
information called for by the subpoenas.


SEC Investigation.

In July 2006, we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting an informal non-public
investigation of certain stock option grants made from January 1997 to present and in April 2007 we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting a formal investigation of such
stock option grants. As a result of the Special Litigation Committee's internal review of our option grants, in February 2007 we restated our financial statements for prior periods in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. On August 9, 2007, we received a "Wells" notice from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement of
the SEC informing us of its intention to request authority to file charges, and seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with its investigation. We have submitted a response to the Staff's notice.
We continue to cooperate with the Staff and continue to expect to resolve this investigation by means of a settlement rather than a contested litigation of charges.

Tax Inquiries.

We have been in contact with and have received requests for information from taxing authorities for records relating to the
grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken by us from October 2000 to October 2004.

Special Litigation Committee.

In connection with its investigation, the Special Litigation Committee determined that certain stock options
issued by us to certain members of our Board of Directors were improperly dated. As a result, and in connection with our remedial measures, we entered into an agreement with each of the relevant
directors whereby they agreed to remit to us any after-tax gains that they realized as a result of the improper grant dates. In the event of grants that remained unexercised, we
re-priced such stock options to reflect an appropriate price for which such stock options should have been deemed granted. This agreement was entered into voluntarily by us and the
relevant directors, none of whom served on the Special Litigation Committee. In addition, we have subsequently entered into similar agreements with certain former members of management who received
improperly dated stock options.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends in the future is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, capital
requirements and other relevant factors. Our current credit agreement restricts the payment of dividends on our stock.

Stock Performance Graph

The following line graph compares from October 31, 2002 through October 31, 2007, the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative
total return on the stocks comprising the NASDAQ Composite Index and the stocks comprising a peer group index consisting of Activision, Inc., Electronic Arts, Inc., Atari, Inc.,
Interplay Entertainment Corp., Midway Games Inc. and THQ Inc. The comparison assumes $100 was invested on October 31, 2002 in our common stock and in each of the following indices
and assumes reinvestment of all cash dividends, if any, paid on such securities. We have not paid any cash dividends and, therefore, our cumulative total return calculation is based solely upon stock
price appreciation and not upon reinvestment of cash dividends. Historical stock price is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Overview

Our Business

We are a global publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our publishing segment consists of our Rockstar Games, 2K
Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play publishing labels. We develop, market and publish software titles for the leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms including: Sony's PLAYSTATION®3
("PS3") and PlayStation®2 ("PS2") computer entertainment systems; Sony's PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) ("PSP") system; Microsoft's Xbox 360® ("Xbox 360")
and Xbox® ("Xbox") video game and entertainment systems; Nintendo's Wii™ ("Wii"), GameCube™, DS™ ("DS") and Game Boy® Advance ("GBA"); and
for the PC and Games for Windows®. The installed base for the prior-generation of console platforms, including PS2, Xbox and GameCube ("prior-generation platforms") is substantial, and the
release of the Xbox 360 platform in fiscal 2006 and the releases of the PS3 and Wii platforms in fiscal 2007 ("next-generation platforms") have further expanded the video game software
market. The extent and timing of the increase in the installed base of the next-generation platforms will significantly impact our business and profitability. Our plan is to diversify and
continue to expand the number of titles released on the next-generation platforms while continuing to market titles developed for prior-generation platforms given their significant
installed base, as long as it is economically attractive to do so.

Our
strategy is to capitalize on the growth of the interactive entertainment market, particularly the expanding demographics of video game players, and focus on creating premium quality games and
successful franchises for which we can create sequels. We have established a portfolio of successful
proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of genres including action, adventure, strategy, role-playing, sports and racing. We have created, licensed
and acquired a group of highly recognizable brands to match the variety of consumer demographics we aspire to serve, ranging from adults to children and hard-core game enthusiasts to
casual gamers. We expect Rockstar Games, our wholly-owned publisher of the hit

Grand Theft Auto

and

Midnight
Club

franchises, to continue to be a leader in the action product category by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands. We also expect 2K Games,
developer of the successful

Civilization

series and the critically acclaimed

BioShock

to continue to
develop new and successful franchises in the future. Our 2K Sports series, which includes

Major League Baseball 2K

,

NBA
2K

,

NHL 2K

and

College Hoops 2K,

provides more consistent year over year revenue
streams than our Rockstar Games and 2K Games businesses because we publish them on an annual basis.

Revenue
in our publishing segment is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles, software titles developed on our behalf by third parties and the sale of video game
accessories and peripherals. Operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new, commercially successful products and to manage software
product development costs. Although software development costs as well as the development cycle for next-generation platforms have increased compared to prior-generation platforms, the
impact is partially offset by the higher selling prices on next-generation software. We develop most of our front-line products internally, and we own many of our most
important intellectual properties, which we believe best positions us financially and competitively. Operating margins associated with our externally developed titles, or titles for which we do not
own the intellectual property, are generally lower because they require us to acquire licenses and provide minimum development guarantees. We continue to develop new revenue streams as they evolve,
including higher margin sources such as in-game advertising and downloadable episodic content, which we expect will become more significant to our business over time.

Our
distribution segment, which is primarily comprised of our Jack of All Games subsidiary, distributes our products as well as third party software, hardware and accessories to retail outlets
primarily in North


America.
Revenue in our distribution segment is derived from the sale of third party software titles, accessories and hardware. Operating margins in our distribution business are dependent in part on
the mix of software and hardware sales. Software product sales generally yield higher margins than hardware product sales.

2007 Financial Summary

The year ended October 31, 2007 was a transition year for the video game industry and our business performed below our expectations, reflecting the lack of new releases
in our

Grand Theft Auto

franchise and a lower than anticipated installed based of next-generation platforms. We had initially anticipated
the release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

in the fourth quarter of 2007; however its release date was delayed to the second quarter of 2008 to allow for
additional development.

Highlighting
our 2007 fiscal year were new offerings, such as our critically acclaimed

BioShock,

released in the fourth quarter of 2007.

BioShock

was one of the highest
rated games to date on Xbox 360 according to both GameRankings.com and Metacritic.com, and shipped approximately
2.1 million units worldwide through October 31, 2007. Our sports titles continued to improve, particularly our

NBA 2K

series and

Major League Baseball 2K

series.

NBA 2K8,

released in the fourth quarter of 2007, was again the highest
rated NBA title for the third consecutive year according to GameRankings.com. We also released first iterations of

The Darkness

and

The Bigs

and expanded
our presence in the casual games market with our release of

Carnival Games.

The
relatively low installed base of next-generation platforms continued to impact our business in 2007; however, we expect that the recent price reductions on the Xbox 360 and PS3
hardware platforms, and the recent slate of next-generation software titles coming to market will benefit our business in 2008. As a result, we continued to make significant investments in
next-generation game development, as reflected in


the
increase in the balance of our capitalized software costs and licenses. The PS3 gaming platform was not as widely accepted by consumers as we initially expected, which negatively impacted our 2007
results. Conversely, Nintendo's Wii outperformed our expectations. Our 2007 development budgets had initially favored the Sony and Microsoft next-generation platforms; however, with the
success of the Wii, we deployed additional resources to develop products for that platform. We released a total of six titles on the Wii in 2007, all during the third and fourth quarters and have
announced several titles that will be published for that platform in 2008. Typically, our budgets to develop games on the Wii are lower than the average development costs for other
next-generation platforms.

The
2007 fiscal year was also a transition year for our Board and executive management team. In March, stockholders voted to replace five out of six members of our Board, including our Chief Executive
Officer. We established a relationship with ZelnickMedia as a result of this transition, and ZelnickMedia now provides executive management services to us and our Board. Subsequent to the management
transition, and in response to the difficult operating environment in 2007, we realigned certain management functions, undertook cost cutting measures and shored up our balance sheet with a
$100 million secured line of credit (subsequently expanded to $140 million in November 2007). We also began to explore alternatives for businesses that we consider to be
non-core, evidenced by the sale of our Joytech accessories manufacturing business in September 2007. See "Management Change" below for the complete details of the management
transition and the details of our 2007 reorganization plan.

Management Change

During the second quarter of 2007, our stockholders elected five new directors and one incumbent director to our Board, rather than the six incumbent directors nominated for
election by the incumbent Board. The newly elected Board elected a new Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of the Company and one additional incumbent director, and on March 30, 2007, we entered
into an agreement with ZelnickMedia for executive management services. The Board and ZelnickMedia immediately began to implement a plan to restructure our executive management team, which included
entering into separation agreements with our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Board also appointed an eighth board member in the second quarter of 2007.

ZelnickMedia
agreed to provide executive management services to us and our Board for an initial term through October 31, 2011. In consideration for its services, we agreed to pay ZelnickMedia
an annual
management fee of $750,000 and a bonus of up to $750,000 per fiscal year based on achieving and exceeding a budgeted earnings level. In addition, on August 27, 2007, we issued ZelnickMedia
stock options to acquire 2,009,075 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $14.74 per share in connection with this agreement. The options granted in connection with this agreement vest
over 36 months and expire 10 years from the date of grant.

Our
newly elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are partners of ZelnickMedia and the cost for their services to us is covered by our management agreement with ZelnickMedia. Except for health
benefits and reimbursement of expenses, our newly elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not compensated by us.

In
the second quarter of 2007, we began to implement a business reorganization plan. The priorities and progress of such plan are as follows:

1.

We
have taken the following measures to review and optimize our management and organizational structure:

•

We
restructured our international operations to consolidate and align the marketing, sales and operational functions according to business discipline rather than geography
to create a more efficient and responsive international organization.


•

We
realigned label and studio administrative functions to report to their respective departments at the corporate level, thereby ensuring increased control and
accountability.

•

We
are in the process of consolidating the management, marketing and business development operations of the 2K Games and 2K Sports labels on the West Coast of the United
States to improve access to resources, work more closely with the sports development teams, and provide a centralized organization to increase efficiency and better support the growth of these labels.

•

We
consolidated our third party PC distribution into our North American sales operations.

We
expect these measures to reduce fixed overhead by approximately $25 million on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal 2008. In order to achieve such annualized cost savings, we expect to
incur approximately $20 million of business reorganization and related charges through fiscal year 2008. These charges will consist of approximately $10 million of restructuring costs
related to our cost savings initiatives and approximately $10 million of expenses related to our management and board changes. Through October 31, 2007, approximately
$17.5 million of these charges have been incurred, primarily consisting of severance, office closing costs and professional fees.

2.

We
continue to assess our business units and develop strategic alternatives for any business that is determined to be non-core. In September 2007, we completed the
sale of our Joytech accessories business to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. for approximately $3.6 million in cash and notes receivable.

3.

We
continue to seek ways to maximize the value of our critical external relationships, such as those with our hardware and intellectual property licensors.

4.

We
established a disciplined approval process for software titles in an effort to develop only those with adequate market potential. In the third quarter of 2007, we formalized a
product investment review committee consisting of our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, and the senior management of our publishing labels and sales force. The committee
meets on a periodic basis throughout software development cycles and reviews development budgets, milestones, sales scenarios, expected return on investment analysis, and launch plans. The committee
also conducts retrospective reviews to assess performance versus projections. We believe this new process will improve the competitiveness and profitability of our titles.

5.

We
are aggressively pursuing resolution of our outstanding legal and regulatory matters. We remain in contact with the regulatory agencies to assure them of our continued cooperation.
In November 2007, we announced the preliminary settlement of all consumer class action lawsuits pending against us in connection with the "Hot Coffee Modification" that could be used by
consumers to alter the content of our

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

video game.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make
estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and
other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions,
estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty,
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.

We
have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, resulting


from
the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed
throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on
the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and
related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue
Recognition" in conjunction with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software when there is
(1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or
determinable and (4) collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60-day terms. Advances received
for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue.

Some
of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer. Currently, none of our products requires an internet connection for use, and online
functionality is perceived to be of only incidental value to the software product itself. When such functionality is offered to the consumer, we do not provide ongoing technical support for gameplay.
Accordingly, we consider such features to be insignificant deliverables and do not defer revenue related to products containing online features.

Some
of our software products include in-game advertising for third party products. Up front payments received for in-game advertising are reported on the balance sheet as
deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue, which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product.

Revenue
is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions. In specific circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or
are unable to determine that collection of receivables is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of
the receivables is probable.

Allowances for Returns and Price Concessions

We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of our products, we grant price concessions to
permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. Our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive
price concessions, including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.

Our
distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock
balancing and make accommodations to customers, which includes credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations.

We
make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based
upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of
sell-through rates, sales force


and
retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers.

Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We believe we can make
reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments
to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Software Development Costs

We utilize both internal development teams and third party software developers to develop the titles we publish.

We
capitalize internal software development costs (including stock-based compensation, specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and
release of titles), third party production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title. Technological feasibility of a product includes the
completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation. Amortization of such capitalized costs is recorded on a title-by-title basis in cost of goods
sold (software development costs) using (1) the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or (2) the
straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title, whichever is greater.

We
have established an internal royalty program that allows certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing. Royalties earned by employees
under this program are recorded to cost of goods sold as they are incurred.

We
frequently enter into agreements with third party developers that require us to make advance payments for game development and production services. In exchange for our advance payments, we receive
the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as, in some
cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. Such agreements allow us to fully recover the advance payments to the developers at an agreed royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of
such software, net of any agreed costs. We capitalize all advance payments to developers as software development. On a product-by-product basis, we reduce software development
costs and record a corresponding amount of research and development expense for any costs incurred by third party developers prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product. We typically
enter into agreements with third party developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed developer contract
as research and development expense. We also generally contract with third party developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed, which often allows
for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle. In instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract, we
monitor the software development process and require our third party developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products.

We
capitalize advance payments as software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title and amortize them, on a title-by-title
basis, as royalties in cost of goods sold. Royalty amortization is recorded using (1) the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the
title or (2) the contractual, revenue based royalty rate defined in the respective agreement, whichever is greater.

At
each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs, advance development payments and any other unrecognized
minimum commitments that have not been paid, using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis, and charge any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable to cost of goods sold. We use various measures to
estimate future


revenues
for our software titles, including past performance of similar titles and orders for titles prior to their release. For sequels, the performance of predecessor titles is also taken into
consideration.

Prior
to establishing technological feasibility, we expense research and development costs as incurred.

Licenses

Licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks, copyrights, technology or other intellectual property
rights in the development of our products. Agreements with rights holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property. Guaranteed minimum payments
are initially recorded as an asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) upon execution of a licensing agreement, provided that no
significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor. When significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor, we record payments when actually paid.

Certain
licenses, especially those related to our sports products, extend over multi-year periods and encompass multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments, these
licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder, based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds.

Capitalized
licensing fees are amortized as royalties in cost of goods sold on a title-by-title basis at a ratio of (1) current period revenues to the total revenues
expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or (2) the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement, whichever is greater.
Similar to software development costs, we review our sales projections quarterly to determine the likely recoverability of our capitalized licenses as well as any unpaid minimum obligations. When
management determines that the value of a license is unlikely to be recovered by product sales, capitalized licenses are charged to cost of goods sold, based on current and expected revenues, in the
period in which such determination is made. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales for a title include: historical performance of comparable titles; orders
for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Asset Impairment

Business Combinations—Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The purchase method of accounting requires that assets acquired and
liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the
completion date of an acquisition. The costs to acquire a business, including transaction, integration and restructuring costs, are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition.
Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

We
evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant
level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions
of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to
present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other
participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the
characteristics of the asset and the availability of information. Changes in our strategy and/or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require reductions to recorded
intangible asset balances.


Long-lived assets.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are
directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset's residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss
requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent
appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. We derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

. Under the fair value
recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period.
Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including, in the case of stock option awards, estimating expected stock volatility. In addition, judgment is also
required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results
of operations could be materially impacted.

We
have granted stock options, which are subject to variable accounting, to ZelnickMedia in connection with our management services agreement with them. When variable accounting is applied to stock
option grants, we re-measure the intrinsic value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised. Compensation expense
in any given period is calculated as the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period, less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period. As a result, changes in
stock prices will change the intrinsic value of the options and compensation expense or benefit recognized in any given period.

Prior
to November 1, 2005, we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

("APB 25"). Under APB 25, generally, no compensation expense was recognized in connection with the awarding of stock option grants to employees, provided
that, as of the grant date, all terms associated with the award were fixed and the quoted market price of the stock was equal to or less than the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock as
defined. In June 2006, we undertook an internal review of historical
stock option awards and determined that grant dates reported in our records for a substantial number of stock option awards issued from April 1997 through August 2003 were not the proper
measurement dates for accounting purposes. Significant judgment was applied in determining new measurement dates for many of our stock option awards during that period. For fixed awards, compensation
expense was measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted. Compensation expense for fixed awards was
recognized ratably over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.

Income Taxes

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely
than not to be realized. Our cumulative pre-tax loss in recent fiscal years represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the
deferred tax asset is appropriate. This valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items.

Our
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets or


liabilities,
or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly
assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

At
each period end, it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax
jurisdictions, amounts of permanent and temporary differences, the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks. These estimates and assumptions are
revised as new events occur, more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained. The impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they
become known.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

("SFAS 157"), which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 will be effective for us on November 1, 2008. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 157
will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

In
September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements

("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the SEC's views on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year
misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The provisions of SAB 108 are effective for us on November 1, 2007. We do not expect that the adoption of SAB 108
will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109

("FIN 48"), to create a single model to address the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax
position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for us beginning November 1, 2007. The cumulative-effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded to opening retained earnings. We do
not expect that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value
accounting but does not affect existing standards, which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure certain
financial assets and financial liabilities, on an instrument-by-instrument basis. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which
fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 with earlier adoption permitted. We have elected not to early adopt and are currently assessing the impact of
SFAS 159 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.


Fluctuations in Operating Results and Seasonality

We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of: the timing of the introduction of new titles; variations in sales of titles developed
for particular platforms; market acceptance of our titles; development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles, sequels or enhancements of existing titles; projected and
actual changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors; product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors; the size and timing of
acquisitions; the timing of orders from major customers; order cancellations; and delays in product shipment. Sales of our products are also seasonal, with peak shipments typically occurring in the
fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters) as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season. Quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not
necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Net revenue from our

Grand Theft Auto

franchise was $103.7 million lower in 2007, reflecting a decrease
from the strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for PSP and PS2 in the prior year. In addition, net revenue related to

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,

which was released in the second quarter of 2006, was approximately $63.1 million lower in 2007. Partially
offsetting the decline in our net revenue were sales of

BioShock,

our new title that was released in the fourth quarter of 2007 on the Xbox 360 and PC,
and which had sales of $85.1 million. In addition, revenue from our baseball titles increased by $38.2 million due to better performance of

Major League Baseball
2K7

compared to its predecessor title and a greater number of product releases, including

The Bigs

on five platforms and

MLB Power Pros

on two platforms

.

Although
consumer demand for the PS3 system did not increase as quickly as anticipated in 2007, revenue for our titles for that platform accounted for $66.2 million, or 9.6%, of our net
publishing revenue in the current year. Nintendo's Wii system sold at a stronger than expected rate in 2007; our software sales for the Wii system accounted for $35.5 million, or 5.1%, of our
net publishing revenue in 2007. Software sales for the Xbox 360 accounted for 29.7% of net revenue and increased $31.2 million, or 17.9%, again reflecting the 2007 sales of

BioShock

for this
platform of $63.1 million, offset by a decrease of $34.4 million in sales of

The Elder Scrolls
IV: Oblivion

. Software sales for the PSP handheld system decreased $68.9 million in 2007, primarily due to the strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto:
Liberty City Stories

in 2006

.

Sales for the PS2 and Xbox prior-generation systems decreased $81.2 million due to the
continuing hardware transition and increased availability of the PS3 and Xbox 360. We have also continued to reduce prices of our software titles for the PS2 and Xbox platforms as the
next-generation hardware installed base grows. Software sales for PC declined $31.6 million, or 25.3%, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease in revenue for sales of

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

for PC, and a $14.1 million decrease in sales of our

Civilization

series, both of which
were released in 2006. The decrease was partially offset by sales of

BioShock

for the PC of $22.0 million in 2007.

Product
costs as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent compared to the prior year. Software development costs decreased in 2007, reflecting the above average external royalty
costs for

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

and approximately $18.8 million of impairment charges for unreleased titles in 2006. We recorded
$4.1 million of impairment charges for unreleased titles in 2007. In addition, in 2007 we were able to realize a significant increase in the gross profit margin of our internally developed
titles, particularly

BioShock

and our sports products. Both

Major League Baseball 2K7

and our

NBA 2K

series
had significantly higher gross margins than their predecessor games due to higher revenues on a comparable amount of software development
costs. Internal royalty expense was lower as a percentage of net revenue in 2007 as a result of fewer Rockstar titles being released and significantly lower sales of

Grand
Theft Auto


products.
License expense was a greater percentage of net revenue in 2007, reflecting the releases of

Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, All-Pro Football
2K8, Ghost Rider

and

The Darkness,

compared to

The Da Vinci Code, Torino 2006

and

24: The Game

in the prior year. Sports licensing costs, however, were a lower percentage of net revenue, particularly for our baseball titles where
we had a greater number of products released and higher overall revenues than in the prior year. We expect to realize increasing margins in fiscal 2008 with the release of internally developed,
wholly-owned titles such as

Grand Theft Auto IV

and

Midnight Club: Los Angeles

.

Revenue
earned from licensing our intellectual property to third parties increased to $30.8 million in 2007 from $10.9 million in 2006, primarily related to our January 2007
release of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PS2 and the July 2007 release of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City
Stories

for the PSP and PS2 in Japan. We recognize substantially higher gross profit margins on revenue earned in connection with licensing our products.

Revenue
earned outside of North America accounted for approximately $239.9 million in 2007 compared to $305.1 million in 2006. The year-over-year decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

and

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City
Stories

from the prior year. Foreign exchange rates benefited revenue by approximately $18.7 million in 2007.

revenue associated with software sales for next-generation platforms increased $23.3 million, which reflected the releases of PS3 and Wii hardware in the first quarter
of 2007 and the continuing increase in the installed base of the Xbox 360. Next-generation software also has higher price points than their predecessor products. We expect to see increases
in sales for next-generation platforms as the installed base of the hardware continues to grow. In addition, sales of hardware increased $7.9 million, or 8.4%, due to the
introduction of the PS3 and Wii systems. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by a decrease in prior-generation software sales of $14.8 million in 2007 as a result of the continued
decline in sales volume and average selling price of value and front-line software titles as the gaming industry transitions to
next-generation platforms. We also continue to see increased competition in the value software market. In addition, we experienced a decline in sales of our PC products of
$10.0 million, or 18.5%. Foreign currency exchange rates increased net revenue by approximately $2.8 million in 2007. Gross profit margins remained relatively consistent compared to the
prior year.

We maintained a consistent level of selling and marketing expense on a percentage of net revenue basis in 2007. The decreased expense level compared to the
prior year reflects larger expenditures in 2006 for marketing and promotion for our

Grand Theft Auto

products. We also spent $2.5 million less in
marketing at the annual E3 trade show event in 2007 as a result of the industry wide downsizing of the event compared to past years.

General
and administrative expenses decreased due to lower stock-based compensation expense, reflecting cost savings associated with the departure of our former management team. We also achieved
approximately $2.8 million of cost savings in 2007 as a result of our 2006 studio closures, for which we recorded $1.9 million of severance and lease termination expenses in 2006. The
2006 year also included $2.3 million related to the relocation of our international publishing headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland. Higher expenses related to information technology
system improvements of approximately $2.6 million in 2007 offset the decrease in our 2007 general and administrative expenses discussed above.

General
and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 also included occupancy expenses (primarily rent, utilities and office expenses) of $14.9 million and $15.2 million, respectively,
related to our development studios.

In
2006, we recorded approximately $3.5 million of severance expense relating to the termination of research and development employees resulting from studio closures. The 2006 studio closures
resulted in a reduced number of development personnel and cost savings of approximately $4.0 million in 2007. In addition, we realized higher software capitalization rates as a result of
increased development work in progress for next-generation platforms.

Business
reorganization and related expenses include employee termination costs of $10.1 million, primarily as a result of severance for former management and consolidating our international
operations. We recorded $2.9 million of relocation and lease termination costs related to the relocation of our 2K headquarters to California. In total, we spent $4.4 million on
professional fees related to the replacement of prior management and the election of five new directors to our Board of Directors at our annual stockholders' meeting (rather than the six incumbent
directors nominated and recommended by our incumbent Board of Directors), $2.0 million of which was investment banking fees incurred by prior management to consider the possibility of
presenting alternative proposals to our stockholders, including a


potential
sale of the Company. We expect to incur approximately $3.0 million of reorganization expenses in fiscal 2008.

In
2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $8.1 million related to goodwill and fixed assets at our Joytech subsidiary, a manufacturer and distributor of video game accessories, which
operates within our publishing segment. The impairment charges reflected a decline in the fair value of Joytech's business resulting from increased competition and a decline in the price and sales
volume of prior-generation accessories due to weaker market conditions and the ongoing transition to next-generation platforms. Additional impairment charges of approximately
$7.5 million were related to the write-off of certain trademarks, acquired intangibles, investments and fixed assets. These write-offs were based on management's
assessment of the future value of these assets, including future business prospects and estimated cash flows to be derived from these assets.

In
September 2007, we sold substantially all of the assets, primarily inventory and accounts receivable, of our wholly-owned Joytech video game accessories subsidiary, formerly a component of
our publishing segment, for approximately $3.6 million in cash. The disposition of Joytech did not involve a significant
amount of assets or materially impact our operating results. We recognized a $3.1 million loss on the sale of our Joytech business.

In
the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized a loss of $1.4 million when we deconsolidated the net assets of Blue Castle Games, Inc., which was previously accounted for, in accordance
with FIN 46(R), as a wholly-owned subsidiary and considered to be a variable interest entity. Blue Castle continues to develop certain of our sports titles; however, we are no longer considered to be
the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle's future profits or losses.

Provision for income taxes.

Income tax expense of $10.2 million for 2007 was higher than the
$0.4 million expense for 2006 due to our ability in 2006 to carry back losses to prior years, thereby taking a tax benefit for a portion of the net operating loss generated in 2006. No such
carry back is available for our 2007 loss. We recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $63.5 million in 2006 and increased it by $40.6 million in 2007 based on the uncertainty of
the realization of certain deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate differed from the federal, state and foreign statutory rates primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances.

We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments.

Net loss and loss per share.

For the year ended October 31, 2007, net loss was $138.4 million,
compared to $184.9 million in 2006. Net loss per share for the year ended October 31, 2007 was $1.93, compared to $2.60 in 2006. Weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat
compared to the prior period and did not have a significant impact on our loss per share.

Net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2006 decreased compared to the prior year, which included strong sales of

Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas

, our most popular product to date.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

was released in October 2004 for PS2
and in June 2005 for Xbox and PC, and accounted for more than 25% of our total revenue in 2005. Net revenue from

Grand Theft Auto

products was
$226.9 million lower in the 2006 period. In 2006, we also experienced a decline in net revenue due to weaker industry conditions, resulting largely from the transition to
next-generation hardware platforms and the associated decrease in demand for prior-generation video games. Consumers often delay their software purchases in anticipation of
next-generation platform launches and as a result, we reduced prices on some of our prior-generation software titles to meet diminishing demand throughout 2006. Offsetting the decrease
were strong sales of

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

for the Xbox 360 and PC of $104.8 million in 2006. Net revenue for the years ended
October 31, 2006 and 2005 includes licensing revenue of $10.9 million and $17.8 million, respectively.

We
continue to derive the majority of our revenue from software that is created for video game console platforms, which accounted for 60.2% of revenue in 2006 compared to 78.5% for the comparable 2005
period. We expect our revenue mix to continue to favor game consoles. Handheld gaming platforms
have also contributed significantly to our revenue, due mostly to the success of our

Grand Theft Auto

brand titles for the PSP.

Product
costs became a greater percentage of total net revenue in 2006, as we lowered prices and earned lower margins on some of our prior-generation software titles, and continued to shift our focus
to developing for next-generation gaming platforms. Software development costs and royalties as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2006 due to higher external royalty costs related
to sales of externally developed software titles, particularly

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

The average cost of game development increased in 2006, a
trend that we expect to persist as next-generation platforms allow for more elaborate gameplay experiences. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $20.7 million in 2006 to
write off certain product, royalty and software development costs related to game titles that we no longer intended to bring to market and therefore would not recover their capitalized value. Internal
royalties were lower as a result of our significant sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

in 2005. Increased license costs in 2006 reflected the first
full year of our long-term, third party exclusive licensing relationships with Major League Baseball Properties and the Major League Baseball Players Association.

Operations
outside of North America accounted for approximately 40.5% and 42.8% of our net revenue in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, we realized lower revenue in Europe, again reflecting the
comparison to the higher sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

in 2005. International revenue for 2006 primarily


consisted
of sales of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for PSP and PS2,

The Elder Scrolls IV:
Oblivion

for Xbox 360 and PC,

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

on multiple platforms,

Grand Theft Auto:
Vice City Stories

for PSP and

Prey

for Xbox 360 and PC.

Foreign
currency exchange rates benefited net revenue by approximately $6.0 million in 2006.

Our
distribution revenue is derived from the sale of third party software titles, hardware and accessories. The decrease in distribution revenue in 2006 reflected increased competition and a decline
in the sales volume and average selling prices of value and front-line software titles, as our industry transitioned to next-generation platforms. The decline in sales of
software titles was partially offset by an increase in hardware sales and peripherals, largely due to the launch of Microsoft's Xbox 360 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Foreign currency exchange
rates decreased net revenue by approximately $4.7 million in 2006. Gross margins remained consistent year over year.

We maintained a consistent level of selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue in 2006 by decreasing overall spending compared to the prior
year, which contained substantial marketing and promotion expenses for

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

. In 2006, we also spent $6.5 million less on
in-store promotional advertising and reduced by $1.4 million our expenses incurred at
E3, an annual industry trade exhibition. The decrease was also due to lower personnel expenses, primarily resulting from a reduction in incentive compensation of $2.0 million, consistent with
our decreased revenues and net profits in 2006. Partially offsetting our decrease in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended October 31, 2006 were increases in advertising and
promotion of our 2K Sports games, particularly

Major League Baseball 2K6

.

General
and administrative expense increased in 2006, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $11.6 million, which included approximately $6.9 million of expense related to
the adoption of


SFAS 123(R)
on November 1, 2005. We also incurred incremental severance costs of $0.6 million in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2006 in connection with our cost savings
plans, which included three studio closures. The increase in stock-based compensation in 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation of $2.9 million, consistent with our
decreased revenue and net profits in 2006.

Operating
expenses in 2006 reflected a full year of general and administrative expenses related to our 2005 acquisitions, resulting in approximately $1.0 million of additional occupancy and
related expenses compared to the prior year. In addition, as a result of various ongoing legal matters, including a review of our stock option grants and process improvement projects, we incurred an
incremental $4.6 million in professional fees in 2006. In 2006, general and administrative expenses also increased for lease termination fees of $1.3 million incurred in connection with
the closure of development studios, additional insurance expense of $3.1 million and costs for information technology system improvements of $2.8 million. General and administrative
expenses for 2006 and 2005 also included occupancy expenses (primarily rent, utilities and office expenses) of $15.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively, for our development studios.

The
decrease in research and development expense in 2006 was primarily attributable to studio closures and lower personnel costs, which decreased by approximately $7.2 million. Lower incentive
compensation in 2006 of $8.3 million, consistent with decreased revenue and net profits in 2006, and a greater percentage of salary and related costs for our software development personnel
being capitalized, resulted in lower compensation expense than in 2005. Production expenses also decreased by $1.8 million in 2006 as more of our titles reached the technological feasibility
stage of development. Employee severance costs of $3.5 million incurred in connection with the closure of development studios and a full year of expenses related to our 2005 business
acquisitions offset our $7.9 million decrease in research and development costs in 2006.

A
substantial portion of our development costs are capitalized once software development projects reach technological feasibility, which is relatively early in the development process. Such costs are
subsequently amortized as cost of goods sold commencing with the initial release of the title. Amounts earned under our internal royalty program, which are based on product sales, are expensed as
incurred in cost of goods sold. During 2006, $8.1 million of equity compensation recorded in connection with SFAS 123(R), which is directly related to the completion and release of our
titles, was capitalized as software development costs. Such costs are amortized as cost of goods sold upon release of the title.

We
recorded impairment charges of approximately $15.6 million in 2006, related to the write-off of goodwill and fixed assets at our Joytech subsidiary as well as other intangibles.
The impairment charges were based on management's assessment of the future value of these assets, including future business prospects and estimated cash flows to be derived from these assets.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased in 2006 as we upgraded and improved software systems and recorded a full year of expense related to the fixed assets and leasehold improvements acquired
in connection with our development studio purchases in 2005 and 2006.

Provision for income taxes.

Income tax expense was $0.4 million for 2006 compared to $6.4 million for
2005. The income tax expense recorded against our net loss in 2006 was primarily a result of a $63.5 million increase in our valuation allowance that was recorded in accordance with
SFAS 109 to reduce our deferred tax assets, which increased our net loss per share by approximately $0.89. The valuation allowance was primarily recorded due to uncertainty regarding the
realization of deferred tax assets attributable to our net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the significant adjustment to our valuation allowance during 2006, our effective tax rate was
0.2% for the full year, compared to 15.4% in the prior year, which was impacted by additional reserves recorded for product returns primarily related to our North American retail inventory of

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

.

We
adopted SFAS 123(R) on November 1, 2005, which requires, among other items, the recognition of stock option expense in the results of operations. As a result of the adoption of
SFAS 123(R), the income


tax
effects of compensatory stock options are included in the computation of the income tax expense (benefit), and deferred tax assets and liabilities, subject to certain prospective adjustments to
stockholders' equity for the differences between the income tax effects of expenses recognized in the results of operations and the related amounts deducted for income tax purposes. Prior to our
adoption of SFAS 123(R), the tax benefits relating to the income tax deductions for compensatory stock options were recorded directly to stockholders' equity.

We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments.

Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.

For the year ended October 31, 2006, net loss was
$184.9 million, or $2.60 per share, compared to net income of $35.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share,
for the year ended October 31, 2005, resulting from the changes referred to above and a higher number of weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects shares issued in connection with
stock-based compensation arrangements and business acquisitions. The review of stock option granting practices performed by us and the Special Committee resulted in a $1.3 million reduction in
net income, or $0.02 per diluted share in 2006, compared to a reduction in net income of $1.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements have been to fund (i) the development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products (ii) working capital
(iii) acquisitions and (iv) capital expenditures. In addition, we expect to incur further cash obligations as part of our business reorganization initiatives. Historically, we have
relied on funds provided by operating activities and short and long-term borrowings to satisfy our working capital needs.

In
July 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. (the "Credit Agreement"), which provided for a revolving credit facility in an amount equal to the lesser
of (a) $100.0 million and (b) the borrowing base, which consists of the sum of 85% of eligible accounts receivable (net of certain reserves), plus 65% of eligible inventory (net
of certain reserves), plus $25.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement were secured by substantially all of our U.S. based assets and the equity of our domestic subsidiaries.
As of October 31, 2007, we had borrowed $18.0 million and had $72.0 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We had $10.0 million of letters of credit
outstanding at October 31, 2007. As of October 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants and requirements in the Credit Agreement.

In
November 2007, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. (the "Amended Credit Agreement"), which increased the principal amount of our
revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $140.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a borrowing base, which restricts our ability to borrow to the sum of
(a) $40.0 million and (b) the sum of 85% of U.S. eligible accounts receivable (net of certain reserves) and the lesser of 65% of U.S. eligible inventory (net of certain reserves)
or $50.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement separately provides for borrowings by certain of our United Kingdom subsidiaries (the "U.K. Subfacility"), in an amount equal to the lesser of
(a) $25.0 million or (b) the U.K. borrowing base, which consists of the sum of 85% of the eligible accounts receivable (net of certain reserves) of our United Kingdom
subsidiaries, plus the lesser of 50% of the eligible inventory of our United Kingdom subsidiaries and $4.0 million. Amounts drawn on the U.K. Subfacility reduce the principal amount that we are
able to borrow in the U.S., provided that the U.S. borrowing base allows for at least $100.0 million in borrowings.

Amounts
outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries based in the U.S. and U.K. Revolving loans under the Amended Credit


Agreement
bear interest at our election of (a) 1.00% to 1.25% above a certain base rate, or (b) 2.25% to 2.50% above the LIBOR Rate, with the margin rate subject to the achievement of
certain average liquidity levels. We are also required to pay a fee of 0.375% on the unused available balance. The Amended Credit Agreement matures on July 3, 2012.

The
Amended Credit Agreement contains customary restrictions and remedies for events of default. Beginning in January 2008, the Amended Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that we
maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than one to one for the trailing 12 month period, if the liquidity of our operations (including available borrowings under the Amended Credit
Agreement) falls below $30.0 million, based on a 30-day average.

As
of October 31, 2007 and 2006, amounts due from our five largest customers comprised approximately 54.4% and 45.4% of our gross accounts receivable balance, respectively, with our significant
customers (those that individually comprised more than 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance) accounting for 41.9% and 36.4% of such balance at October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection experience.

Generally,
we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers and our receivables are generally not
covered by insurance. However, from time to time we purchase insurance from financial institutions on our accounts receivable, with certain limits, to help protect us from loss in the event of a
customer's bankruptcy or insolvency.

We
are subject to credit risks, particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets. If we are unable to collect our accounts
receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position and we would be required to increase our provision for doubtful accounts.

We
have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years. Generally, these include:

•

Agreements
to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights and technology for use in the publishing, marketing and distribution of our software
titles. Our
licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players' associations and expire at various times through October 2012;

•

Contractual
advances and royalty payments to third party software developers that expire at various times through December 2009. Guaranteed minimum payments assume
satisfactory performance;

•

Operating
leases, primarily related to occupancy, furniture and equipment, expiring at various times through June 2015; and

•

Distribution
agreements to purchase third party software games that require guaranteed minimum payments through October 2008.


A summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of October 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands of dollars):

In
addition to the cash commitments above, we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for contingent cash consideration subject to certain acquired companies achieving
agreed upon financial or unit sales goals. The amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a full
discussion of our potential acquisition commitments.

We
believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations, along with availability under our Credit Agreement, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy
our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months. In addition, management believes it has the ability, if necessary, to
implement further restructuring activities that would substantially reduce personnel and personnel-related costs, reduce capital expenditures, reduce research and development expenditures and/or
reduce selling and marketing expenditures. Management also believes it has the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary.

Our
cash and cash equivalents decreased by $54.7 million for the year ended October 31, 2007 as follows:

At
October 31, 2007 we had $77.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $132.5 million at October 31, 2006. Our decrease in cash and cash equivalents from
October 31, 2006 was primarily a result of cash used for operating activities. In 2007, our net loss was partially offset by non-cash expenses and a decrease in working capital,
primarily due to reduced revenue levels. Increased software development costs and licenses reduced cash flow from operating activities as we continued to prepare for the major releases of

Grand Theft Auto IV

and

Midnight Club: Los Angeles

in fiscal 2008 and inventory increased due to the
higher installed base of next-generation platforms and related software demand.

Our
cash flow from operations was also impacted by payments for professional fees related to our stock option investigation. During the year ended October 31, 2007, we paid approximately
$14.0 million related to such matters. In addition, we used $13.9 million of cash in the year ended October 31, 2007 for our business reorganization initiatives, mainly for
severance and lease termination costs and professional fees related to our change in senior executive management and consolidating our international and 2K operations. We expect to incur further cash
obligations in 2008 as we continue to take actions to improve our cost structure.


Cash
used for investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures in 2007, which decreased compared to the prior period. Purchases of fixed assets reflect the continuous investment in
programming and development equipment, high-definition monitors and leasehold improvements at certain of our studios. We also made cash payments of $5.8 million for prior year
acquisitions. The cash payments were partially offset by $2.8 million of cash received from the sale of our Joytech subsidiary.

Cash
provided by financing activities reflected the cash received from our line of credit of $18.0 million and the exercise of stock options in 2007, which was higher than the amount received
in 2006 as a result of a higher average stock price during 2007 and trading restrictions imposed as a result of our stock option investigation in the prior year. These cash receipts were offset by
cash paid for debt issuance costs in connection with our Credit Agreement in the third quarter of 2007.

Cash
and cash equivalents increased $8.2 million in 2007 as a result of foreign currency exchange translation.

International Operations

Net revenue earned outside of the United States is principally generated by our operations in Europe, Canada, Australia and Asia. For 2007 and 2006, approximately 31.3% and
39.4%, respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside of the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.

Historically,
fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results. We had an outstanding loan balance of $18.0 million under our Credit Agreement as of
October 31, 2007. As of October 31, 2007, we had $10.0 million of letters of credit outstanding. Under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance bears interest at our election
of (a) 0.50% to 1.00% above a certain base rate (7.50% at October 31, 2007), or (b) 1.75% to 2.25% above the LIBOR rate (weighted average rate of 7.62% at October 31,
2007), with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels. Changes in market rates may impact our future interest expense. For instance, if the LIBOR rate were to
increase or decrease one percentage point (1.0%), our expected annual interest expense would change by approximately $0.2 million based on our outstanding balance as of October 31, 2007.

In
November 2007, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. Revolving loans under the new agreement bear interest at our election of
(a) 1.00% to 1.25% above a certain base rate, or (b) 2.25% to 2.50% above the LIBOR Rate, with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels.

We
transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into United
States dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant quarter end. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity. For the year ended October 31,
2007, our foreign currency translation adjustment gain was approximately $28.0 million. The foreign exchange transaction gain recognized in our statement of operations for the year ended
October 31, 2007 was $1.6 million.

Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements and supplementary data appear in a separate section of this report following Part IV. We provide details of our valuation and qualifying
accounts in "Note 17—Supplementary


Financial
Information" to the consolidated financial statements. All schedules have been omitted since the information required to be submitted has been included on the consolidated financial
statements or notes thereto or has been omitted as not applicable or not required.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

Upon the approval of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, on April 4, 2006, the Company dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our
independent registered public accounting firm.

During
the Company's fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 and through April 4, 2006 there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in
connection with its reports on the financial statements for such years. PwC's reports on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 did not contain
an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During
the Company's fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004 and through April 4, 2006, there have been no reportable events as set forth in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K except as follows:

As
more fully disclosed in Item 9A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, the Company had identified the following material
weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005:

•

The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the existence and valuation of its accounts payable related to inventory purchases. Specifically, the Company did not
maintain effective controls to identify, analyze and reconcile amounts related to inventory purchases included in accounts payable to underlying supporting documentation.

•

The
Company did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy of the amortization of its capitalized software development costs. Specifically, the Company did not have
effective controls to accurately prepare and review inputs to a spreadsheet application used to calculate amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs.

On
April 4, 2006, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial
statements. During the three months ended January 31, 2006 and through April 4, 2006, neither we nor anyone on our behalf consulted with E&Y regarding either: (i) the application
of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report nor
oral advice was provided to us by E&Y that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that
was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, were effective as of October 31, 2007 to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods


specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

(ii)

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

(iii)

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on our financial statements.

Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject
to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of October 31, 2007. Our independent registered public accounting firm, E&Y, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report on
the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears on page 57 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. at
October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, effective November 1, 2005, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.'s
internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated December 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

We have audited Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on
the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc. as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
October 31, 2007 of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and our report dated December 20, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)

1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (the "Company", "we", "us", or similar pronouns) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1993. We are a leading
global publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our publishing segment, which consists of Rockstar Games, 2K Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play,
develops, markets and publishes software titles for the following leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms:

Sony

Microsoft

Nintendo

PLAYSTATION®3

Xbox 360®

Wii™

PlayStation®2

Xbox®

DS™

PSP® (PlayStation®Portable)

Game Boy® Advance

We
also develop and publish software titles for the PC. Our distribution segment, which primarily includes our Jack of All Games subsidiary, distributes our products as well as third party software,
hardware and accessories to retail outlets primarily in North America.

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and of entities for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary as
defined in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain
amounts in the financial statements of the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of software development costs, licenses and intangibles, valuation of
inventories, realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for returns, price concessions and doubtful accounts. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.

In
July 2005, the Entertainment Software Rating Board determined that our

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

title should carry an Adults Only ("AO")
rating in North America instead of the previously determined Mature ("M") rating. The re-rating of the product negatively impacted our sales, and as a result, in July 2005, we
recorded a provision of $32,637 for estimated product returns. Such provision was subsequently reduced by $8,154 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 after better than expected sales and lower
processing costs related to product returns. The resulting impact on our consolidated results of operations in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 was a reduction of approximately $24,500
and $5,900 for net revenue and cost of goods sold, respectively, and a reduction of $18,600 for both gross profit and income from operations. As of October 31, 2006, the reserve for estimated
product returns related to

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

was zero and no material adjustments were made to the reserve for the year then ended.

In April 2005, we effected a three-for-two stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Accordingly, all share and per share data in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto give retroactive effect to the stock split.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximates fair value
because of their short maturities. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At October 31, 2007 we had $3,538
of cash on deposit reported as a component of prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying balance sheet because its use was restricted.

We
transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant sales and purchase transactions denominated in foreign currencies. From time to time, we use forward exchange contracts to
mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency assets and liabilities, primarily certain inter-company receivables and payables. We do not designate foreign currency forward contracts
as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." As a result, we mark to market our foreign currency forward contracts each period and
any gains and losses are recognized in net income. At October 31, 2007, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We maintain cash balances at several major financial institutions. While we attempt to limit credit exposure with any single institution, balances often exceed insurable
amounts.

If
the financial condition and operations of our customers deteriorate, our risk of collection could increase substantially. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major
retailers and distributors. Our five largest customers accounted for 51.1%, 49.4% and 40.7% of net revenue in each of the three years ended October 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of
October 31, 2007 and 2006, the five largest customers accounted for 54.4% and 45.4% of our gross accounts receivable, respectively. Customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of
our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 41.9% and 36.4% of such balances at October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Except for the largest customers noted above, all receivable
balances from the remaining individual
customers are less than 10% of our net receivable balance. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection
experience.

Inventory, net

Inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated product
returns are included in the inventory balance at their cost.

Software Development Costs

We utilize both internal development teams and third party software developers to develop the titles we publish.

We
capitalize internal software development costs (including stock-based compensation, specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and
release of titles), third party production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title. Technological feasibility of a product includes the
completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation. Amortization of such capitalized costs is recorded on a title-by-title basis in cost of goods
sold using (1) the proportion of current year revenues to


the
total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or (2) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title, whichever is greater.

We
have established an internal royalty program that allows certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing. Royalties earned by employees
under this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred.

We
frequently enter into agreements with third party developers that require us to make advance payments for game development and production services. In exchange for our advance payments, we receive
the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as, in some
cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. Such agreements allow us to fully recover the advance payments to the developers at an agreed royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of
such software, net of any agreed costs. We capitalize all advance payments to developers as software development costs. On a product-by-product basis, we reduce software
development costs and record a corresponding amount of research and development expense for any costs incurred by third party developers prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product.
We typically enter into agreements with third party developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed
development contract as research and development expense. We also generally contract with third party developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being
developed, which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle. In instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place
prior to an executed contract, we monitor the software development process and require our third party developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally
developed products.

We
capitalize advance payments as software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title and amortize them, on a title-by-title
basis, as royalties in cost of goods sold. Royalty amortization is recorded using (1) the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the
title or (2) the contractual, revenue based royalty rate defined in the respective agreement, whichever is greater.

At
each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs, advance development payments and any other unrecognized
minimum commitments that have not been paid, using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis, and charge any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable to cost of goods sold. We use various measures to
estimate future revenues for our software titles, including past performance of similar titles and orders for titles prior to their release. For sequels, the performance of predecessor titles is also
taken into consideration.

Prior
to establishing technological feasibility, we expense research and development costs as incurred.

Licenses

Licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks, copyrights, technology or other intellectual property
rights in the development of our products. Agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property. Guaranteed minimum payments
are initially recorded as an asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) upon execution of a licensing agreement, provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the
licensor. When significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor, we record payments when actually paid.

Certain
licenses, especially those related to our sports products, extend over multi-year periods and encompass multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments, these
licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds.


Capitalized
licensing fees are amortized as licenses in cost of goods sold on a title-by-title basis at a ratio of (1) current period revenue to the total revenue
expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or (2) the contractual revenue based royalty rate as defined in the licensing agreement, whichever is greater. Similar to software
development costs, we periodically review our sales projections to determine the likely recoverability of our capitalized licenses as well as any unpaid minimum obligations. When we determine that the
value of a license is unlikely to be recovered by product sales, capitalized licenses are charged to cost of goods sold, based on current and expected revenue, in the period in which such
determination is made. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales for a title include: historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to
release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Fixed Assets, net

Office equipment, furniture and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years. Computer equipment and
software are generally depreciated using the straight-line method over three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or seven years.
The cost of additions and betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations, in the periods incurred. When depreciable assets are retired or sold, the cost and
related allowances for depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. The carrying amounts of these assets are recorded at historical cost.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of purchase price paid over identified intangible and tangible net assets of acquired companies. Intangible assets consist of trademarks, intellectual
property, non-compete agreements, customer lists and acquired technology. Certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized as assets apart from goodwill.
Identified intangibles other than goodwill are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the period of expected benefit ranging from three to ten years, except for
intellectual property,
which are usage-based intangible assets that are amortized using the shorter of the useful life or expected revenue stream.

We
perform an annual test for impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or earlier if indicators of impairment exist. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using a
discounted cash flow analysis and compare such values to the respective reporting unit's carrying amount. As a result of the fiscal 2006 impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge for
the year ended October 31, 2006. See Note 7 for more details of the charge.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including assets
to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. We compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset and its fair value. The estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at our incremental borrowing rate or fair value, if available.

During
the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006, we took measures to reduce costs and close three of our underperforming development studios. We ceased the development of certain software titles,
resulting in a non-cash impairment charge (recorded as a component of cost of goods sold) of $20,742 to write off unrecoverable capitalized software and royalties, primarily in connection
with such studio closures. We also


wrote
off fixed assets, trademarks and other assets, resulting in a charge to operating expenses of $7,528 in the year ended October 31, 2006. In addition, in connection with our 2006 goodwill
impairment testing, we recognized a charge of $1,739 related to fixed assets at our Joytech subsidiary that had book values in excess of fair value. All of such costs were recorded in our publishing
segment.

Income Taxes

We recognize deferred taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the
years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation
allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. We do not record income tax expense related to foreign withholding
taxes or United States income taxes which may become payable upon the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely
outside of the United States.

Our
cumulative pre-tax loss in our three most recent fiscal years represents sufficient negative evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a full valuation allowance against
deferred tax assets is appropriate in several of our reporting jurisdictions, primarily the United States and Switzerland. This valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future
tax deductions as well as carryforward items. Although we expect that these assets will ultimately be utilized, future realization cannot be assured.

We
use estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions, amounts of permanent and temporary differences,
the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks. These estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur, more experience is acquired and
additional information is obtained. The impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known.

Revenue Recognition

We earn our revenue from the sale of internally developed interactive software titles and from the sale of titles developed by and/or licensed from third party developers
("Publishing revenue"). We also earn revenue from the sale of interactive software titles published by third parties, hardware and accessories ("Distribution revenue").

We
recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition", in conjunction
with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software titles when there is (1) persuasive evidence
that an arrangement with the customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and
(4) collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60-day terms. Advances received for licensing and
exclusivity arrangements are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue.

Some
of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer. Currently, none of our products requires an internet connection for use, and online
functionality is perceived to be of only incidental value to the software product itself. When such functionality is offered to the consumer, we do not provide ongoing technical support for gameplay.
Accordingly, we consider such features to be an insignificant deliverable and do not defer revenue related to products containing online features.


Some
of our software products include in-game advertising for third party products. Up front payments received for in-game advertising are reported on the balance sheet as
deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue, which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product.

Revenue
is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns, price concessions and other allowances. In circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price
concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine
that collection of the receivable is probable.

Allowances for Returns, Price Concessions and Other Allowances

We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of our products, we grant price concessions that
permit customers to take credits for unsold merchandise against amounts they owe us. Our customers must satisfy certain conditions to allow them to return products or receive price concessions,
including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.

Although
our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock
balancing and make accommodations to customers, which include credits and returns, when demand for specific titles fall below expectations.

We
make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue based upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in
similar genres, historical performance of a hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of sell-through rates, sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market
conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers.

Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We believe we can make
reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments
to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Consideration Given to Customers and Received from Vendors

We have various marketing arrangements with retailers and distributors of our products that provide for cooperative advertising and market development funds, among others,
which are generally based on single exchange transactions. Such amounts are accrued as a reduction to revenue when revenue is recognized, except for cooperative advertising which is included in
selling and marketing expense if there is a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit's fair value can be established.

We
receive various incentives from our manufacturers, including up-front cash payments as well as rebates based on a cumulative level of purchases. Such amounts are generally accounted for
as a reduction in the price of the manufacturer's product and included as a reduction of inventory or cost of goods sold, based on (1) a ratio of current period revenue to the total revenue
expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the product or (2) an agreed upon per unit rebate, based on actual units manufactured during the period.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 amounted to $78,004, $83,533 and $101,077,
respectively.


Net Income (Loss) per Share

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding
during the same period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and
common stock equivalents, which includes shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding during the same period. For the years ended
October 31, 2007 and 2006, common stock equivalents were excluded from our computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because their effect would have been antidilutive due to
the net loss for those periods. The number of common stock equivalents excluded was approximately 5,624,000, 7,208,000 and 3,126,000 for the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Stock-based Compensation

Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted SFAS 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

, which revised Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based payment transactions with employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as compensation
expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options was not
recognized in the statement of operations if the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the grant date, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Prior to November 1, 2005, we had adopted the
disclosure-only provisions under SFAS 123.

We
elected to use the Modified Prospective Application ("MPA") method for implementing SFAS 123(R). Under the MPA method, prior periods are not restated and new awards are valued and accounted
for prospectively upon adoption. Outstanding prior stock option awards that were not vested as of October 31, 2005 were recognized as compensation expense in the statement of operations over
the remaining requisite service period. See Note 13 for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation arrangements.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the applicable local currency. Accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and average prevailing exchange rates for the period for revenue and expense accounts. Adjustments resulting from translation are included in
other comprehensive income (loss). Realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur, except on inter-company balances considered to be long
term. Transaction gains and losses on inter-company balances considered to be long term are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign exchange transaction gains included in net income for
the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 amounted to $1,644, $2,176 and $1,560, respectively.

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company's items of other comprehensive income


(loss)
are foreign currency translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are permanent in nature and therefore do not require tax adjustments.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
Measurements

("SFAS 157"), which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 will be effective for us on November 1, 2008. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 157
will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements
when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on the SEC's views on how the effects of the carryover
or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The provisions of SAB 108 are effective for us on November 1, 2007. We do not expect
that the adoption of SAB 108 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109

("FIN 48"), to create a single model to address the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax
position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest, and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for us on November 1, 2007. The cumulative-effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded to retained earnings. We do not expect
that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value
accounting but does not affect existing standards, which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure certain
financial assets and financial liabilities, on an instrument-by-instrument basis. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which
fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 with earlier adoption permitted. We have elected not to early adopt and are currently assessing the impact of
SFAS 159 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

2.     BUSINESS REORGANIZATION AND RELATED CHARGES

Management Change

At our Annual Stockholders' Meeting held on March 29, 2007, our stockholders elected five new directors and one incumbent director to our Board of Directors rather than
the six incumbent directors nominated for election by the incumbent Board. The newly elected Board elected a new Chairman and a new Chief Executive Officer of the Company and one additional incumbent
director, and on March 30, 2007, we entered into an agreement with ZelnickMedia Corporation for executive management services. The Board and ZelnickMedia immediately began to implement a plan
to restructure our executive management team, which included entering into separation agreements with our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.


ZelnickMedia
agreed to provide executive management services to us and our Board for an initial term through October 31, 2011. In consideration for its services, we agreed to pay ZelnickMedia
an annual management fee of $750 and a bonus of up to $750 per fiscal year based on achieving and exceeding a budgeted earnings level. In addition, on August 27, 2007, we issued stock options
to acquire 2,009,075 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $14.74 per share in connection with this agreement. The options granted in connection with this agreement vest over
36 months and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Each month, we re-measure the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of the award and record compensation expense for
the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period, less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period. As a result, changes in the price of our common stock will
change the intrinsic value of the options and compensation expense or benefit recognized in any given period.

For
the year ended October 31, 2007, we recorded $1,283 of stock-based compensation related to this agreement.

Our
newly elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are partners of ZelnickMedia and the cost for their services to us is covered by our management agreement with ZelnickMedia. Except for health
benefits and reimbursement of expenses, our newly elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are not directly compensated by us.

Prior
to our Annual Stockholders' Meeting in March 2007, we explored the possibility of presenting alternatives to our stockholders, including the possible sale of the Company, and as a result
incurred substantial professional fees, including approximately $2,000 for investment banking services. Additionally, we reimbursed ZelnickMedia approximately $1,010 of expenses related to the
management changes, which is included in business reorganization and related charges in the accompanying statements of operations.

Reorganization and related charges

We initiated a business reorganization plan in the second quarter of 2007, which includes initiatives to consolidate functions in central locations. As a result, we have
incurred employee termination, relocation, and lease termination costs. In addition, we incurred severance and professional fees related to our former management team. In total, we expect to record
approximately $20 million of business reorganization and related costs, with approximately $10 million of such costs related to our cost savings initiatives and approximately
$10 million of expenses related to our management and board changes.

The
following table summarizes activity in accrued business reorganization costs:

3.     BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND CONSOLIDATION

During the three years ended October 31, 2007, we consummated the acquisitions described below, which largely reflect our efforts to diversify our business by adding
seasoned development studios, intellectual properties and talented personnel resources to our existing infrastructure. The acquisitions were not considered to be material to our consolidated
statements of operations, individually or in the aggregate. The results of operations and financial position of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from their
respective acquisition dates forward and therefore affect comparability from period to period. During the year ended October 31, 2007, we paid contingent consideration of $2,813 and $2,000 for
our prior year acquisitions of Firaxis Games, Inc. and Irrational Studios, respectively. We also paid $982 in connection with a 2004 acquisition.

In November 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Firaxis Games, Inc., a developer of PC and strategy titles, including the

Civilization

franchise. Total
consideration paid upon acquisition was $15,442 including 678,683 shares of our unregistered common stock and $4,085 of
development advances paid prior to the acquisition. We also agreed to make additional contingent deferred cash payments of up to $11,250 based on future product sales, of which approximately $10,000
will be recorded as additional purchase price and $1,250 will be recorded as employee compensation expense when the conditions requiring their payment are met. The goodwill recorded in connection with
this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

In
August 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Irrational Studios, the developer of

BioShock

. Total consideration
paid upon acquisition was $7,762, including 81,833 shares of our common stock paid at closing and $1,550 of development advances paid prior to the acquisition. We also agreed to make additional
guaranteed deferred cash payments and contingent deferred cash payments. The guaranteed deferred cash payments of $2,000 were due equally on the first and second anniversary dates of the acquisition,
which has been fully paid as of October 31, 2007. The goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.

In
June 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Gaia Capital Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including PAM Developments SAS, the developer of our

Top Spin

series. Total
consideration paid upon acquisition was $9,803 which included $4,055 of development advances paid prior to the acquisition. We
also agreed to make additional guaranteed deferred cash payments of $1,597, of which


$597
has been paid as of October 31, 2007. The goodwill recorded on this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.

In
January 2005 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock and certain intellectual property rights of Visual Concepts Entertainment and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kush Games, the
developers of certain of our sports titles. Total consideration paid upon acquisition was $29,660, which included $1,866 of development advances paid to SEGA prior to acquisition. The goodwill
recorded in connection with this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.

7.     GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

We assess goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. During the third quarter
of the year ended October 31, 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $6,341 related to our Joytech subsidiary, our manufacturer and distributor of video game accessories and
peripherals, which operates within our publishing segment. The impairment charge was recorded as a component of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and was
determined by comparing the fair value of the Joytech business and the implied value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets, with the carrying amounts on the balance sheet. The
decline in the fair value of the Joytech business was due to increased competition and a decline in the price and sales volume of prior-generation accessories due to weaker market conditions and the
ongoing transition to next-generation hardware platforms. We performed an annual impairment assessment of goodwill for our reporting units as of August 1, 2007 and did not identify
any impairment.

8.     CREDIT AGREEMENT

On July 3, 2007, we entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc., which provides for a revolving credit facility in an
amount equal to the lesser of (a) $100,000 or (b) a borrowing base consisting of the sum of 85% of eligible accounts receivable (net of certain reserves), plus 65% of eligible inventory
(net of certain reserves), plus $25,000. Amounts outstanding


under
the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our U.S. based assets and the equity of our domestic subsidiaries. Revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our
election of (a) 0.50% to 1.00% above a certain base rate (7.5% at October 31, 2007), or (b) 1.75% to 2.25% above the LIBOR Rate (weighted average rate of 7.62% at
October 31, 2007), with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels. We are also required to pay a fee of 0.375% on the unused available balance. The Credit
Agreement matures on July 3, 2012. As of October 31, 2007, we had borrowed $18,000 and had $72,000 available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

The
Credit Agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $25,000. Any letters of credit outstanding reduce availability under the revolving line of
credit. We are required to pay a one time issuance fee of 0.825% per drawing and an annual fee of 1.75% to 2.25% (2.25% at October 31, 2007) of any outstanding letters of credit. We had $10,000
of letters of credit outstanding at October 31, 2007.

The
Credit Agreement substantially limits us and our domestic subsidiaries' ability to: create, incur, assume or be liable for indebtedness; dispose of assets outside the ordinary course; acquire,
merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity; create, incur or allow any lien on any of their respective properties; make investments; or pay dividends or make distributions (each
subject to certain limitations). In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest, breaches of representations and warranties,
noncompliance with covenants, acts of insolvency, default on indebtedness held by third parties and default on certain material contracts (subject to certain limitations and cure periods). Beginning
in November 2007, the Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than one to one for the trailing twelve month period, if the liquidity of
our domestic operations falls below $30,000 (including available borrowings under the credit facility), based on a 30-day average. As of October 31, 2007, we were in compliance with
all covenants and requirements outlined in the Credit Agreement.

Debt
issuance costs capitalized in connection with the Credit Agreement totaled $1,809 and are being amortized over the five year term of the Credit Facility. Amortization related to these costs is
included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

In
May 2006, our European subsidiary renewed its Credit Facility agreement with Lloyds TSB Bank plc ("Lloyds") under which Lloyds agreed to make available net borrowings of up to
£13,100 (approximately $26,500 at July 31, 2007) through the expiration of the agreement on July 31, 2007. We had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement through
its expiration date and did not renew the credit agreement with Lloyds.

10.   LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS

Various lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations are pending involving us and certain of our subsidiaries as described below in this section. In accordance with SFAS
No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, we record accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition to the matters described herein, we are involved, or may become involved, in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business, which in our
opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Consumer Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

In July 2005, we received four complaints for purported class
actions. Two of the four complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, one was filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, and one was filed in the Circuit Court in St. Clair County, Illinois. The plaintiffs, alleged purchasers of our

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

game, assert that we engaged in consumer deception, false advertising and breached an implied warranty of merchantability and were unjustly enriched as a result of our
alleged failure to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained "hidden" content, which resulted in the game receiving a Mature 17+
("M") rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or the ESRB, rather than an Adults Only 18+ ("AO") rating. The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of various violations
of law and litigation costs.

In
November 2007, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted preliminary approval to a settlement of the foregoing consumer class action lawsuits. If the
proposed settlement receives final approval from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, all claims in these lawsuits will be dismissed without any admission of
liability or wrongdoing by us. We have committed to spend at least $1,025 on settlement benefits, and the settlement generally caps the defendants' out-of-pocket costs at no
more than $2,750, in addition to the costs of providing notice to class members and paying a fee to plaintiffs' counsel. We have established a reserve sufficient to cover the expected cost of this
settlement and related expenses.

City of Los Angeles Consumer Litigation.

In January 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court
of the State of California alleging violations of California law on substantially the same basis as the consumer class action regarding

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

. The state court actions were removed to federal court (a motion to remand filed by the City of Los Angeles is


pending)
and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all the cases to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which consolidated them under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game
Consumer Litigation (No. II), 06-MD-1739 (SWK)(MHD)

. The plaintiffs have filed a motion
seeking certification of a nationwide class, which motion is pending. The parties have engaged in settlement discussions.

Securities Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Option Backdating.

In February and March 2006, four purported
class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints alleged that we
violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a), as well as Rule 10b-5, of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making untrue statements or failing to disclose in certain press releases
and periodic reports filed with the SEC that, among other things,

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained "hidden" content which should have resulted in
the game receiving an "AO" rating from the ESRB rather than an "M" rating. The actions were consolidated under the name

In re Take-Two Interactive Securities
Litigation

, No. 1:06-cv-00803 (SWK), and a lead plaintiff was appointed. In September 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated
amended complaint, which included claims relating to

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

and to the backdating of stock options. On April 16, 2007, the
lead plaintiff filed a consolidated second amended complaint, which included additional allegations based on an investigation of options backdating conducted by the Special Litigation Committee of the
Board of Directors and the Company's restatement of financial statements relating to options backdating. This complaint was filed against us, our former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief
Financial Officer, our former Chairman of the Board, two of our directors and one former director, our Rockstar Games subsidiary, and one officer and one former officer of our Rockstar Games
subsidiary. On June 25, 2007, we and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated second amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to these motions to dismiss on
September 4, 2007, and reply briefs were filed on October 4, 2007. Now that briefing on the motions to dismiss is complete, we are awaiting a decision by the Court.

St. Clair Derivative Action.

In January 2006, the St. Clair Shores General Employees Retirement System filed a
purported class and derivative action complaint in the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and directors,

St. Clair Shores Gen.
Employees Retirement System v. Eibeler

, no. 1:06-cv-0688 (SWK). The factual allegations in
this action are similar to those in

In re Take-Two Interactive Securities Litigation

. The plaintiff asserts that certain defendants breached
their fiduciary duty by selling their stock while in possession of certain material non-public information and that we violated Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9 of
the Exchange Act by failing to disclose material facts in our 2003, 2004 and 2005 proxy statements in which we solicited approval to increase share availability under our 2002 Stock Option Plan. The
plaintiff seeks the return of all profits from the alleged insider trading conducted by the individual defendants who sold our stock, unspecified compensatory damages with interest and its costs in
the action. In October 2006, the court issued a stay of proceedings pending an investigation by the Special Litigation Committee. Following the conclusion of that investigation, on
March 23, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the complaint based on, among other things, the Committee's conclusion that "future pursuit of this action is not in the best
interests of Take-Two or its shareholders." The plaintiff subsequently conducted discovery concerning the Special Litigation Committee's motion to dismiss. On August 24, 2007, the
plaintiff filed an Amended Derivative and Class Action Complaint. The Amended Derivative and Class Action Complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with the issuance of proxy statements in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. On September 24, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint or to
consolidate certain of its claims with

In re Take-Two Interactive Securities Litigation

.

Derivative Action—Option Backdating.

In July and August 2006, Richard Lasky and Raeda Karadsheh filed purported
derivative action complaints in the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and directors. The complaints alleged


violations
of federal and state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment in connection with the granting of
certain of our stock options. The complaints sought unspecified damages against all of the individual defendants, reimbursement from certain of the defendants of bonuses or other incentive or equity-
based compensation paid to them, equitable and other relief relating to the proceeds from certain of the defendants' alleged improper trading activity in our stock, adoption of certain corporate
governance proposals and recovery of litigation costs. The Lasky and Karadsheh actions were consolidated in November 2006 under the name

In re Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc. Derivative Litigation

, no. 1:06-cv-05279 (LTS). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on
January 22, 2007, which focuses exclusively on our historical stock option granting practices. These matters were referred to the Special Litigation Committee. On September 7, 2007, the
Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss certain parties from the litigation and to have any claims against the remaining parties be assigned to us for disposition by our management and board of
directors. The plaintiffs have sought discovery concerning the Committee's recommendation, and the briefing of the motion is expected to be completed in February 2008.

Strickland et al. Personal Injury Action.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of the Estates of Arnold Strickland, James
Crump and Ace Mealer brought an action in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against the Company, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc., Sony Corporation of America,
Wal-Mart, GameStop and Devin Moore, alleging under Alabama's manufacturers' liability and wrongful death statutes, that our video games designed, manufactured, marketed and/or supplied to
Mr. Moore resulted in "copycat violence" that caused the death of Messrs. Strickland, Crump and Mealer. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants
in excess of $600,000. Our motion to dismiss the action on the merits was denied. An accompanying motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied by the trial court, and the Alabama
Supreme Court subsequently rejected a petition for writ of mandamus on that issue In April 2006, the plaintiffs amended the complaint to add a claim for civil conspiracy; the Company moved to
dismiss that claim and the motion is pending. Under the most recent amended scheduling order, all fact and expert discovery was to have been completed by June 15, 2007, with a mediation on
November 8, 2007 and trial, if necessary, to commence no earlier than January 18, 2008. Due to issues that arose in expert discovery, however, the amended scheduling order was suspended.
The case is currently stayed until mid-January 2008 to permit the Plaintiffs to obtain new lead counsel. There currently is no Scheduling Order in effect. We believe that the claims
are without merit and that this action is similar to lawsuits brought and uniformly dismissed by courts in other jurisdictions.

Posey and Schmid Personal Injury Action.

In September 2006, personal representatives of the estate of Delbert and Tyrone Posey and
Marilea Schmid brought an action against us, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. and Sony Corporation of America and Cody Posey in the Second Judicial District Court of Bernalillo County,
New Mexico, alleging that

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

resulted in "copycat" violence that caused the deaths of the above named individuals. The suit
seeks damages
(including punitive damages) against all of the defendants. Both Sony entities have tendered their defense and requested indemnification from us, and we have accepted such tender. We received copies
of the complaint and summonses in December 2006, and moved to dismiss the complaint in January 2007 for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The plaintiffs
opposed the motions and requested jurisdictional discovery. The court heard argument on the motions on December 18, 2007, and granted such motions in their entirety, thus dismissing the
complaint against us and the Sony defendants. It is expected that the court will enter an order of dismissal in early January 2008, upon which plaintiffs will have thirty days to appeal.

We
intend to vigorously defend all of the above matters and, with respect to the derivative actions, we have been advised that the individual defendants will vigorously defend such actions. However,
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and, if determined adversely to us, such matters, either singly or in


the
aggregate, could result in the imposition of significant judgments, fines and/or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations.

Grand Jury Subpoenas.

We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting production
of documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including those relating to, among other things: the so-called "Hot Coffee" scenes in

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

; the work of
our Board of Directors, all Board Committees, and the Special Litigation Committee; certain acquisitions
entered into by us; billing and payment records relating to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the termination of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our auditors; communications to financial analysts and
stockholders about acquisitions and financial results; compensation and human resources documents of certain of our directors and employees and former directors and employees; stock-based
compensation; the SEC's July 2006 inquiry; legal services performed for employees; corporate credit card and expense records of certain individuals; the SEC bar of the our former Chief
Executive Officer, Ryan Brant; the resolution to amend our Incentive Stock Plan; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies and questionnaires. We fully cooperated and provided the
documents and information called for by the subpoenas.

SEC Investigation.

In July 2006, we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting an informal non-public
investigation of certain stock option grants made from January 1997 to present and in April 2007 we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting a formal investigation of such
stock option grants. As a result of the Special Litigation Committee's internal review of our option grants, in February 2007 we restated our financial statements for prior periods in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. On August 9, 2007, we received a "Wells" notice from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement of
the SEC informing us of its intention to request authority to file charges, and seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with its investigation. We have submitted a response to the Staff's notice.
We continue to cooperate with the Staff and continue to expect to resolve this investigation by means of a settlement rather than a contested litigation of charges.

Tax Inquiries.

We have been in contact with and have received requests for information from taxing authorities for records relating to the
grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken by us from October 2000 to October 2004.

Special Litigation Committee.

In connection with its investigation, the Special Litigation Committee determined that certain stock options
issued by us to certain members of our Board of Directors were improperly dated. As a result, and in connection with our remedial measures, we entered into an agreement with each of the relevant
directors whereby they agreed to remit to us any after-tax gains that they realized as a result of the improper grant dates. In the event of grants that remained unexercised, we
re-priced such stock options to reflect an appropriate price for which such stock options should have been deemed granted. This agreement was entered into voluntarily by us and the
relevant directors, none of whom served on the Special Litigation Committee. In addition, we have subsequently entered into similar agreements with certain former members of management who received
improperly dated stock options.

Licensing and Marketing Agreements:

Our licensing commitments primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights
for use of their trademarks, copyrights, technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products. As of October 31, 2007, $3,285 of our
guaranteed minimum licensing and marketing commitments were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet because the licensor did not have any significant performance obligation to us. Licensing and
marketing commitments expire at various times through October 2012 and primarily reflect our agreements with major sports leagues and players' associations. Certain of our licensing and
marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon software release dates.

Software Development Agreements:

We make payments to third party software developers that include contractual advances and royalties under
several software development agreements that expire at various times through December 2009. Our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by third
party software developers.

Lease Commitments:

Our office and warehouse facilities are occupied under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various
times through June 2015. We also lease certain furniture, equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable leases expiring through May 2012. Some of the leases have fixed rent
increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease. The effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term. Rent expense
amounted to $16,459, $16,658 and $13,484 for the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Distribution Agreements:

We periodically enter into distribution agreements to purchase software games for resale. At October 31,
2007, our distribution agreements expired at various dates through October 2008.

Contingent Consideration:

Part of our business acquisition strategy has been to make a portion of the purchase price of certain
acquisitions dependent on product delivery or future product sales. See Note 3 for a discussion of our contingent commitments related to our business acquisitions.

Employee savings plan:

We maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan and trust. Our 401(k) plan is offered to all eligible employees and
participants may make voluntary contributions. We began matching a portion of the contributions in July 2002. The matching contribution expense incurred by us during the years ended
October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $1,869, $1,989 and $864, respectively.

The
higher income tax expense for 2007 compared to 2006 was due to our ability in 2006 to carry back losses to prior years, thereby taking a tax benefit for a portion of the net operating loss
generated in 2006. No such carry back is available for the 2007 loss.

The valuation allowance for deferred taxes is primarily attributable to increases in net operating losses for which no benefit is provided due to uncertainty
with respect to their realization. In addition, during the year ended October 31, 2007, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $2,048 and a corresponding reduction to additional
paid-in-capital for the cancellation of certain stock options.

At
October 31, 2007, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward totaling $216,957, of which $9,196 is subject to limitation by the Internal Revenue Service, that will begin to expire
in fiscal 2026; a U.S. federal capital loss carryforward of $16,178 that will expire in fiscal 2008; and a foreign net operating loss carryforward of $44,973 that will expire beginning in fiscal 2010,
and foreign net operating losses of $11,978 that may be carried forward indefinitely.

The
total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was approximately $152,000 and $176,000 for the years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. It is our intention to
reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance. Accordingly, no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States
income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends.


We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
return positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable assessments of additional taxes. Additionally, we believe that any assessments in excess
of the amounts provided for will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements.

At
each period end, it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax
jurisdictions, amounts of permanent and temporary differences, the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks. These estimates and assumptions are
revised as new events occur, more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained. The impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they
become known.

13.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Share Repurchases

In January 2003, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up to $25,000 of our common stock from time to time in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In June and August 2005, we repurchased 925,341 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $24,929. All shares repurchased were retired
in August 2005.

In
July 2005, we modified a stock compensation arrangement and accepted for return 412,500 shares of our common stock with a fair market value at the original issuance date of approximately
$9,350, that were held by three employees, for cash bonuses payable in the future. At the date of modification, 366,667 shares were fully vested and $8,311 of compensation expense had been previously
recognized. The remaining unvested shares were forfeited and the additional compensation expense of future cash bonuses of $1,039 has been recognized ratably as expense through February 2006.
In October 2005, the 412,500 shares of common stock returned under this arrangement were retired.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

We recognized $17,329, $21,931, and $10,650 of stock-based compensation expense, net of tax, for the years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also
capitalized approximately $9,983 and $8,084 of stock-based compensation to software development costs and licenses for the years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We did not
capitalize any stock-based compensation for the year ended October 31, 2005. During the year ended October 31, 2007, we recorded $1,283 of stock-based compensation expense for
non-employee awards.

We
have the following stock-based compensation plans:

Incentive Stock Plan.

We adopted an Incentive Stock Plan ("Incentive Plan"), which provides for the grant of up to 4,500,000 shares of
restricted stock, deferred stock and other stock-based awards of our common stock to directors, officers and other employees. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors.

Restricted
stock awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which typically ranges from one to four years. In addition, we capitalize and amortize awards in
accordance with our software development cost accounting policy. As of October 31, 2007, the total future unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to outstanding
unvested restricted stock was approximately $23,000 and will be recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period, or capitalized as software
development costs, through the fiscal year ending October 31, 2009.

Stock Option Plans.

In June 2002, our stockholders approved our 2002 Stock Option Plan, as previously adopted by our Board of
Directors (the "2002 Plan"), pursuant to which officers, directors, employees
and consultants may receive stock options to purchase shares of our common stock. In June 2005, our stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate amount of shares issuable under the 2002
Plan from 9,000,000 shares to 11,000,000 shares. As of October 31, 2007, there were approximately 2,919,000 shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan.

In
January 1997, our stockholders approved our 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, as previously adopted by our Board of Directors (the "1997 Plan"), pursuant to which officers, directors,
employees and consultants may receive options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares (9,750,000 shares after stock split in April 2005) of our common stock. As of October 31,
2007, there were no shares of common stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan.

Subject
to the provisions of the plans, the Board of Directors or any Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, has the authority to determine the individuals to whom the stock options or other
awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each option or other award, the option price, the type of option, the option period, restrictions, if any, on the exercise of the option
or other award, the terms for the payment of the option price and other terms and conditions of the option or other award.

As
of October 31, 2007 and 2006, there were outstanding stock options granted under our stock option plans to purchase in the aggregate 3,809,000 and 5,129,000 shares of our common stock,
respectively, vesting at various times from 2008 to 2010 and expiring at various times from 2008 to 2012. Options granted generally vest over a period of three to five years.

As
of October 31, 2007 and 2006, there are non-plan stock options outstanding for an aggregate of 96,000 and 673,000 shares of our common stock, respectively. The
non-plan stock options outstanding at October 31, 2007 were fully vested in 2007 and expire at various times in 2008.

As
of October 31, 2007, due to the then market price of our common stock, there was no aggregate intrinsic value related to options outstanding or exercisable and the total future unrecognized
compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to outstanding unvested options was approximately $8,623, which will be recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis
over the remaining vesting periods, or capitalized as software development costs, through 2010. At October 31, 2007, the weighted average exercise price of stock options expected to vest was
$22.06.

The
fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that
will usually have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behavior. The
assumptions and variables used for the current period grants were developed based on SFAS 123(R) and SEC guidance contained in


Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, "Share-Based Payment." The following table summarizes the assumptions and variables used by us to compute the weighted average fair value of stock
option grants:

For
the year ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, we used a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility for publicly traded options on our common stock as the expected volatility
assumption required in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which are consistent with SFAS 123(R) and SAB 107. Prior to fiscal 2006, we used our historical stock price volatility in
accordance with SFAS 123 for purposes of determining the pro forma fair value of our outstanding stock options. The selection of the
implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price
trends than historical volatility.

SFAS 123(R)
requires the recognition of stock-based compensation for the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result, for most awards, recognized stock compensation was
reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting primarily based on a historical annual forfeiture rate of approximately 7%. Estimated forfeitures are reassessed at each balance sheet date and may
change based on new facts and circumstances. Prior to October 31, 2005, actual forfeitures were accounted for as they occurred for purposes of determining the pro forma fair value of our
outstanding stock options.

For
the year ended October 31, 2005, if the compensation cost for our stock option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards consistent with the provisions
of SFAS 123(R), our net income and net income per share would have been adjusted to the restated pro forma amounts indicated below:

14.   SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We are a publisher and distributor of interactive software games designed for personal computers, video game consoles and handheld platforms. Revenue earned by our publishing
segment is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles, software titles developed on our behalf by third parties and the sale of certain video game accessories and
peripherals. Revenue earned by our distribution segment is derived from the sale of third party software titles, accessories and hardware.


Our
Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). We are centrally managed and the CODM primarily uses consolidated financial information supplemented by sales information by
product category, major product title and platform for making operational decisions and assessing financial performance.

Our
CODM is presented with financial information that contains information that separately identifies our publishing and distribution operations, including gross margin information. Accordingly, we
consider our publishing and distribution businesses to be distinct reportable segments.

Our
operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue and therefore none has been reported. We do not allocate operating expenses, interest and other income, interest expense or income taxes to
operating segments. Our accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

In
September 2007, we sold substantially all of the assets, primarily inventory and accounts receivable, of our wholly-owned Joytech video game accessories subsidiary, formerly a component of
our publishing segment, to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. for approximately $3,575 in cash and notes receivable. The disposition of Joytech did not involve a significant amount of assets or
materially impact our operating results. We recognized a $3,080 loss on the sale of our Joytech business.

In
the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized a loss of $1,389 when we deconsolidated the net assets of Blue Castle Games, Inc. ("Blue Castle"), which was previously accounted for, in accordance
with FIN 46(R), as a wholly-owned subsidiary and considered to be a variable interest entity. Blue Castle continues to develop certain of our sports titles; however, we are no longer considered to be
the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle's future profits or losses.

16.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In November 2007, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc. (the "Amended Credit Agreement"), which increased the
principal amount of our revolving credit facility from $100,000 to $140,000. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a borrowing base, which restricts our ability to borrow to the sum of
(a) $40,000 and (b) the sum of 85% of U.S. eligible accounts receivable (net of certain reserves) and the lesser of 65% of U.S. eligible inventory (net of certain reserves) or $50,000.
The Amended Credit Agreement separately provides for borrowings by certain of our United Kingdom subsidiaries (the "U.K. Subfacility"), in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) $25,000 or
(b) the U.K. borrowing base, which consists of the sum of 85% of the eligible accounts receivable (net of certain reserves) of our United Kingdom subsidiaries, plus the lesser of 50% of the
eligible inventory of our United Kingdom subsidiaries and $4,000. Amounts drawn on the U.K. Subfacility reduce the principal amount that we are able to borrow in the U.S., provided that the U.S.
borrowing base allows for at least $100,000 in borrowings.

Amounts
outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries based in the U.S. and U.K. Revolving loans under the Amended Credit Agreement
bear interest at our election of (a) 1.00% to 1.25% above a certain base rate, or (b) 2.25% to 2.50% above the LIBOR Rate, with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain
average liquidity levels. We are also required to pay a fee of 0.375% on the unused available balance. The Amended Credit Agreement matures on July 3, 2012.

We
expect to capitalize approximately $750 of debt issuance costs in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, which will be amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the agreement.

In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded impairment charges in cost of goods sold totaling $12,166 to write-off capitalized software costs and
related intangible assets related to our studio closures. In addition, we recorded operating expenses of $1,964 related to severance costs and lease abandonment in the second quarter of 2006.

We
recorded the following expenses in the third quarter of 2006:

a.

$875
in cost of goods sold for the impairment of software development costs;

b.

$3,918
of operating expenses for severance and office abandonment;

c.

Approximately
$900 of stock-based compensation expenses related to the stock option investigation performed by the Special Committee of our Board as a component of operating expenses;
and

d.

Income
tax expense of $59,500 to reduce deferred tax assets, reflecting uncertainty regarding our ability to realize future income tax deductions.
