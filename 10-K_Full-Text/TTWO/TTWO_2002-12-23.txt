PART I

Item 1. Business

General

We develop,
  publish and distribute interactive software games worldwide. Our software operates
  on personal computers and video game consoles manufactured by Sony, Microsoft
  and Nintendo. We develop software internally and engage third parties to develop
  games on our behalf. We publish our products under our Rockstar Games, Gathering
  of Developers and Gotham Games labels.

We continue
  to successfully build new proprietary brands, including

Grand Theft Auto,
  Max Payne, Midnight Club, Smuggler’s Run

and

Spec Ops

. Our
  Rockstar Games® subsidiary released

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

,
  the highly anticipated sequel to

Grand Theft Auto 3

, for Sony’s
  PlayStation®2, in October 2002. Rockstar intends to release sequels to the
  popular brands

Max Payne, Midnight Club

and

State of Emergency

,
  along with future versions of

Grand Theft Auto

. Our Gathering of Developers
  subsidiary also expects to release sequels to

Hidden & Dangerous, Tropico

and

Railroad Tycoon

for the PC, and our Gotham Games subsidiary plans
  to launch MTV’s

Celebrity Deathmatch

for the PlayStation 2, PC and
  Microsoft’s Xbox™.

Our Jack of
  All Games domestic subsidiary distributes our software as well as third-party
  software, hardware and accessories to retail outlets in the United States. Our
  customers in the United States include Wal-Mart, GameStop, Best Buy, Circuit
  City, Electronics Boutique, Toys “R” Us and Blockbuster, as well as
  other leading national and regional drug store, supermarket and discount store
  chains and specialty retailers. We also have sales, marketing and publishing
  operations in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Austria, Denmark,
  Italy, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

In May 2002,
  we acquired all of the intellectual property rights associated with

Max Payne

;
  in August 2002, we acquired Barking Dog Studios, a Canadian-based development
  studio; and in November 2002, we acquired Angel Studios, the developer of

Midnight
  Club

and

Smuggler’s Run.

The Industry

A large and
  growing installed base of video game consoles and advanced PCs combined with
  expanding game player demographics have driven demand for interactive entertainment
  software in recent years. According to the Interactive Digital Software Association
  (IDSA), worldwide sales of consoles, console games and games for the PC were
  estimated to be $20.3 billion in 2001. IDSA also estimates that 60% of all Americans,
  or approximately 145 million people, play video games on a regular basis.

Demand for
  interactive entertainment software is expected to increase due to increasing
  penetration of PC and next-generation console platforms. The International Data
  Corporation (IDC) estimates that approximately 53% of all households in the
  United States own a PC. According to IDC, the household penetration rate for
  video game consoles is approximately 46%, and is expected to increase.

The interactive
  entertainment software industry has transitioned to next-generation platforms,
  which began with the release of Sony’s PlayStation 2 in 2000 and continued
  with the release of Microsoft’s Xbox and Nintendo’s GameCube™ in 2001.
  Demand for these new platforms is significant due to their ability to offer
  one or more of the following features:

•

More powerful and realistic graphics and game
      play through 128-bit technology;

•

Backwards compatibility (the ability to play the platforms’ previous generation of games); and

•

Broad entertainment capabilities, including Internet access and the ability to watch DVD movies and play compact discs.


Interactive
  entertainment software has also increasingly become a mainstream entertainment
  choice for a maturing, technologically sophisticated audience. According to
  IDSA, the average age of Americans who play video games is 28, of which 43%
  are female. Additional catalysts for growth include mass market penetration
  of budget titles, the emergence of non-traditional retail channels such as drug
  stores and supermarkets and price reductions for hardware platforms.

Publishing

The fiscal
  year ended October 31, 2002, represented another record year for our published
  products. For fiscal 2002, we were the number two publisher of PlayStation 2
  software in the United States according to NPDFunworld

SM

TRSTS Video
  Games Monthly Service, garnering a 16.2% dollar share of this market. For this
  year, we were also the number two publisher across all console platforms, with
  a 9.5% dollar share.

Grand Theft
  Auto 3

for Sony’s PlayStation 2 was the top selling video game across
  all platforms in the United States in both dollars and units for fiscal 2002
  according to NPDFunworld. In addition,

Grand Theft Auto 3

has been the
  best selling PlayStation 2 title in North America and Europe since the PlayStation
  2 launch, having sold approximately eight million units globally to date.

Grand Theft
  Auto: Vice City

for the PlayStation 2, the latest installment of our blockbuster
  franchise, was released on October 29 domestically and November 8, 2002 internationally
  (December 13 in Australia).

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

was the top selling
  video game across all platforms in the United States for both four week periods ended
  November 2 and November 30, 2002 according to NPDFunworld. Simultaneously with the domestic
  launch, Sony Music (Epic Records) released a seven CD compilation of the soundtrack of

Grand
  Theft Auto: Vice City.

We publish
  titles under our Rockstar Games, Gotham Games and Gathering of Developers labels.
  Rockstar Games focuses on the creation of groundbreaking original content for
  mature audiences on video game console systems. Our Gathering of Developers
  label concentrates its efforts on publishing a variety of compelling PC products. Gotham
  Games publishes video game products for consumers of all ages at a variety of
  price points, as well as all of our value priced software products for the PlayStation
  previously marketed under the Take 2 label. During fiscal 2002, we released
  the following titles:

  Rockstar under the name

Manhunt

currently under development
  by Rockstar North, the developer of the

Grand Theft Auto

series; and
  from Gotham Games,

Great Escape

, a game based on the 1963 hit movie starring
  Steve McQueen about the true story of a group of POW’s who mount a daring
  escape from a Nazi prison camp.

Arrangements with Major Platform Manufacturers

We have entered
  into license agreements with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to develop and publish
  software in North America and Europe for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox,
  Game Boy Advance and Nintendo GameCube. We are not required to obtain any licenses
  to develop titles for the PC.

We entered
  into a Licensed Publisher Agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment America,
  Inc. in May 2000. Under the agreement, Sony granted us the right and license
  to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the PlayStation
  2 in North America. The agreement requires us to submit products to Sony for
  its approval. The agreement provides for Sony to be the exclusive manufacturer
  of our products for the PlayStation 2 and for us to pay royalties to Sony based
  on the number of units manufactured.

The agreement
  with Sony expires in March 2003 and is automatically renewable for successive
  one-year terms, unless terminated by Sony in the event of a breach by us or
  our bankruptcy or insolvency. Sony may also terminate the agreement on a title-by-title
  basis. Upon expiration or termination of all of our publishing agreements with
  Sony (including those discussed below), we have certain rights to sell off existing
  inventories. We also entered into a similar three-year agreement with Sony in
  March 2000 for PlayStation 2 covering European territories.

We entered
  into a four-year Licensed Publisher Agreement with Sony in November 2002 under
  which Sony granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and
  distribute software titles for the PlayStation in North America. We also entered
  into a similar agreement with Sony in February 1999 for PlayStation covering
  European territories and we are in the process of renewing this agreement.

We entered
  into a Publisher License Agreement with Microsoft in December 2000. Under the
  agreement, Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish
  and distribute software titles for Microsoft’s Xbox in territories to be
  determined on a title-by-title basis. The agreement requires us to submit products
  to Microsoft for its approval and for us to make royalty payments to Microsoft
  based on the number of units manufactured. Products for the Xbox must be manufactured
  by pre-approved manufacturers. The agreement may be terminated by either party
  in the event of a material breach and expires in November 2004. Microsoft may
  also terminate the agreement on a title-by-title basis. Upon expiration or termination
  of the agreement, we have certain rights to sell-off existing inventories.

We entered
  into a three-year Confidential License Agreement with Nintendo in November 2001.
  Under the agreement, Nintendo granted us the right and license to develop, market,
  publish and distribute software for Nintendo’s GameCube in the western
  hemisphere. The agreement requires us to submit products to Nintendo for its
  approval. The agreement also provides for Nintendo to be the exclusive manufacturer
  of our products and for us to make royalty payments to Nintendo based on the
  number of units manufactured. The agreement may be terminated by either party
  in the event of a breach and may be terminated by Nintendo in the event of our
  bankruptcy. Upon termination of all of our agreements with Nintendo (including
  those discussed below), we have certain rights to sell off existing inventories.
  We also entered into a similar three-year agreement with Nintendo in November
  2001 for GameCube covering European territories.


We entered
  into a three-year agreement with Nintendo in July 2001, granting us the right
  and license to develop software for Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance in the
  Western Hemisphere. In October 2001, we entered into a similar three-year agreement
  with Nintendo for European territories.

Software Development and Licensing

We develop
  software titles through our internal development studios, Rockstar San Diego
  (formerly Angel Studios), the developer of

Midnight Club

and

Smuggler’s
  Run

; Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), the developer of the

Grand
  Theft Auto series

; Rockstar Toronto (a/k/a Alternative Realities Technologies)
  the developer of

Max Payne

for the PlayStation 2; Rockstar Vancouver
  (a/k/a Barking Dog Studios); Rockstar Vienna (a/k/a Neo Software), the developer
  of

Max Payne

for the Xbox; and PopTop Software, the developer of

Railroad
  Tycoon 2

and

Tropico

.

As of November
  30, 2002, our internal development studios and product development department
  had 435 employees with the technical capabilities to develop and localize (translate
  into foreign languages) software titles for all major hardware platforms, the
  PC and all major territories.

For the years
  ended October 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, we incurred costs of $11,524,000, $6,190,000
  and $5,668,000, respectively, on research and development relating to our software
  titles. Additionally, for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, we
  capitalized software development costs of $9,645,000, $6,293,000 and $8,837,000,
  respectively.

Certain of
  our software titles are developed by third parties, including Illusions Softworks
  and Apogee Software. Agreements with
  developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require
  us to make advance royalty payments, pay royalties based on product sales and
  satisfy other conditions. Royalty advances for software titles are recoupable
  only against royalties otherwise due to developers.

Our agreements
  with developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts
  and to cease making advance payments if specified development milestones are
  not satisfied. We monitor the level of advances in light of expected sales for
  the related titles and write off unrecoverable advances to cost of sales in
  the period in which we determine the advance will not be fully recouped.

We actively
  seek to acquire rights for well-recognized properties. In December 2000, we
  acquired the exclusive worldwide publishing rights to the best-selling franchise
  of

Duke Nukem

PC and video games. In connection with the acquisition
  of the publishing rights associated with

Duke Nukem

, we entered into
  an agreement with Apogee to develop

Duke Nukem Forever

for the PC.

We own all
  of the intellectual property rights associated with

Grand Theft Auto, Max
  Payne, Midnight Club, Smuggler’s Run, Oni, Myth, Spec Ops, Railroad Tycoon

and

Tropico

. In May 2002, we acquired all of the intellectual property
  rights associated with

Max Payne

for $10 million in cash and 969,932
  shares of restricted common stock (valued at $18.5 million). In connection with
  the acquisition, we entered into an agreement with Apogee and Remedy to develop

Max Payne 2

for the PC. We agreed to make aggregate payments of up to
  $8 million to Apogee and Remedy upon the timely delivery to us of

Max Payne

for the PC and the achievement of certain sales targets for this product.

Sales and Marketing

We sell software
  titles to retail outlets in the United States and Europe through direct relationships
  with large retail customers and third- party distributors. Our customers in
  the United States include Wal-Mart, GameStop, Best Buy, Circuit City, Electronics
  Boutique, Toys “R” Us and Blockbuster as well as other leading mass
  merchandisers; video, electronic and toy stores; national and regional drug
  stores; supermarket and discount store chains; and specialty retailers. Our
  European customers include Dixons, Game Group (formerly Electronics Boutique), Karstadt,
  Carrefour and Media Saturn. We have sales and marketing operations in the United
  Kingdom, France, Germany, Holland, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Australia, New Zealand
  and Canada.


For the year ended October 31, 2002, sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 31.4% of our total revenues. No  single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues during this period.

Our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and broaden distribution of our titles, promote brand name  recognition, assist retailers and properly position, package and merchandise our titles. We market titles by implementing aggressive public  relations campaigns, using print and on-line advertising, television, radio spots and outdoor advertising.

Our Rockstar Games subsidiary actively pursues
    relationships with participants in the music and entertainment industries.
    We believe that the shared demographics between various media and some of
    the software titles marketed by Rockstar Games provide excellent cross-promotional
    opportunities. We have been working with popular recording artists to create
    sophisticated game soundtracks, have entered into agreements to license high-profile
    names and likenesses, and have arrangements for co-branding opportunities.
    Our goal is to accelerate the acceptance of our titles, create brand awareness
    and develop a greater number of franchise brands.

We also employ various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness, including in-store promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail, cooperative advertising, as well as attendance at trade shows. We employ separate sales forces for our  publishing and distribution operations. As of November 30, 2002, we had a sales and marketing staff of 172 persons.

Distribution

We distribute our own titles, as well as third-party titles and hardware through our subsidiaries. We distribute three major categories of  third-party console products, consisting principally of hardware; newly released and popular software titles; and budget and catalog  software titles.

We procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand, as well as  pre-orders from retailers. We periodically enter into agreements with our suppliers that provide exclusive distribution rights to certain  products. We carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response time to retailer orders. We utilize  electronic data interchange (“EDI”), with many of our retailers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders.

Jack of All Games maintains warehouse facilities and sales offices in Ohio, Illinois, Toronto, Canada and New York. Products arrive at our  warehouses where products are picked, packed and shipped to customers. We generally ship products by common carrier. Because we  generally ship products within seven days of receipt of orders, backlog is not material to our business.

Manufacturing

Sony and Nintendo are the sole manufacturers of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms. We begin the  manufacturing process for our published titles by placing a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with Sony or Nintendo and  opening either a letter of credit in favor of the manufacturer or utilizing our line of credit with the manufacturer. We then send software  code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer, together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures  and packaging designs for approval, defect testing and manufacture. Games manufactured by Sony and Nintendo are generally shipped  within two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order. Games for the Xbox must be manufactured by pre-approved manufacturers and  are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order.

Production of PC software includes CD-ROM pressing, assembly of components, printing of packaging and user manuals and shipping of  finished goods, which is performed by third-party vendors in accordance with our specifications. We believe that there are alternative  sources for these services that could be implemented without delay. We send software code and a prototype of a title, together with related  artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs to manufacturers. Games are generally shipped within  two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order.


To date, we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our titles or material delays due to  manufacturing defects. Our software titles carry a 90-day limited warranty.

Competition

In our publishing business, we compete both for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony,  Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms. Each of these competitors has  the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns, particularly for  prime-time television spots. These companies may also increase their own software development efforts or focus on developing software  products for third-party platforms.

We also compete with domestic companies such as Electronic Arts, Activision, Acclaim Entertainment, THQ, Midway Games and  international companies such as Sega, Vivendi, Ubi Soft, Infogrames, Eidos, Capcom, Konami and Namco. In addition, we believe that  large software companies and media companies are increasing their focus on the interactive entertainment software market. Certain of our  competitors are developing on-line interactive games and interactive networks that may compete with our products for consumer dollars.  Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, and are able to carry larger  inventories, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable  properties than we can. Competition in the entertainment software industry is based on product quality and features; brand name  recognition; access to distribution channels; effectiveness of marketing
; and price.

Retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources, and competition is intense among an increasing number of newly  introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail  shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures just to maintain current levels of sales of  our titles. Competitors with more extensive lines and popular titles frequently have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly,  we may not be able to achieve the levels of support and shelf space that such competitors receive. Similarly, as competition for popular  properties increases, our cost of acquiring licenses for such properties is likely to increase, possibly resulting in reduced margins.  Prolonged price competition, increased licensing costs or reduced operating margins would cause our profits to decrease significantly.

Competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and  may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sell-through of our titles at retail stores. Our titles also compete with other forms of  entertainment such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products featuring similar themes, on-line computer programs and  other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

In our distribution business, we compete with large national companies such as Ingram Entertainment, as well as smaller regional  distributors. We also compete with the efforts of the major entertainment software companies that distribute directly to retailers or over the  Internet. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, and are able to carry larger  inventories, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more comprehensive product selection than we can.

Intellectual Property

We develop proprietary software titles and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software titles developed by third parties. We  attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual  restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Although we generally do not hold any patents, we seek to obtain trademark and  copyright registrations for our products.

Interactive entertainment software is susceptible to unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse  engineer our titles to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. In addition, our competitors  could independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies.


As the amount of interactive entertainment software in the market increases and the functionality of this software further overlaps, we  believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the copyrights  or patents of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we  believe that our titles and the titles and technologies of third-party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relationships  do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur.  Any claims of infringement, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, costly and difficult to defend.

International Operations

Sales in international markets, principally in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of  our net sales. For fiscal 2002 and 2001, sales in international markets accounted for approximately 20.1% and 23.7%, respectively, of our net  sales. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant  impact on our operating results. See Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

As of November 30, 2002, we had 939 full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We  consider our relations with employees to be good.

Item 2. Properties

In September 2002, we relocated our principal executive offices to 622 Broadway, New York, New York in approximately 50,000 square feet  of space under a ten-year lease which provides for annual rent of approximately $1,500,000.

We also maintain offices at 575 Broadway, New York, New York in approximately 13,300 square feet of space under a five-year lease with  575 Broadway Corporation, a company controlled by the father of Ryan A. Brant, our Chairman. The lease provides for an annual rent of  approximately $474,000 and expires in 2004. We believe that the terms of the lease are no less favorable than could have been obtained  from an unaffiliated third-party. We intend to relocate our remaining operations to 622 Broadway and will seek to sublease the  575 Broadway space.

Take-Two Interactive Software Europe Limited leases 12,500 square feet of office space in Windsor, United Kingdom. The lease provides  for a current annual rent of approximately $538,000, plus taxes and utilities, and expires in 2011. Rockstar North Limited (formerly DMA  Design Limited) currently leases office space in Dundee and Edinburgh, Scotland, at an annual rent of approximately $400,000. Jack of All  Games, Inc. leases approximately 13,000 square feet of office and warehouse space in College Point, New York. The lease provides for  annual rent of $237,000, plus increases in real estate taxes, and expires in October 2006. Jack of All Games, Inc. also leases approximately  206,000 square feet of office and warehouse space in Cincinnati, Ohio. Jack of All Games, Inc. pays $750,000 per annum, plus taxes and  insurance, under the lease, which expires in January 2006. VLM Entertainment Group Ltd. leases approximately 56,200 square feet of office  and warehouse space in Ottawa
, Illinois at an annual rent of $255,000 and expires in 2009. VLM Entertainment Group, Ltd. leases such  space from its former stockholders and believes that the terms of the lease are no less favorable than could have been obtained from an  unaffiliated third-party.

In addition, our other subsidiaries lease office space in Ontario and Vancouver, Canada; Paris, France; Munich, Germany; Sydney,  Australia; Copenhagen, Denmark; Amsterdam, Holland; Milan, Italy; Vienna, Austria; Leighton Buzzard, UK and in Baltimore, Maryland;  San Diego, California; and Fenton, Missouri for an aggregate annual rent of $1,275,000.


Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In October 2002, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval of an agreement to settle a  consolidated class action lawsuit entitled Gershon Bassman v. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. for $7,500,000 in cash. We recorded  $1,468,000 of class action settlement costs, which represents the settlement of $7,500,000 and related legal fees, net of $6,145,000 of  insurance proceeds.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a formal order of investigation into, among other things, certain accounting matters  relating to our financial statements, periodic reporting and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws.

We are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of our business, which in management’s opinion will not have a material  adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

The last reported sale price for our common stock on December 17, 2002 was $24.60. The number of record holders of our common stock  was approximately 148 as of December 17, 2002. We believe that there are in excess of 1,000 beneficial owners of our common stock.

Dividend Policy.

To date, we have not declared or paid any cash dividends. The payment of dividends, if any, in the future is within the  discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, capital requirements and other relevant factors. Our loan  agreement with the bank prohibits us from paying cash dividends. We presently intend to retain all earnings to finance continued growth  and development of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Changes in Securities.

In August 2002, we issued 242,450 shares of restricted common stock in connection with the acquisition of Barking Dog Studios
Ltd. In connection with the above securities issuance, we relied on Section 4(2) and/or Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as offerings to a limited number of “accredited investors” or Non-US Persons.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion
  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Dollars
  in thousands, except per share amounts)

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
  with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
  periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability
  of prepaid royalties, capitalized software development costs and other intangibles,
  inventories, realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances
  for returns, price protection and doubtful accounts. Actual amounts could differ
  significantly from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Our principal sources of revenues are derived
  from publishing and distribution operations. Publishing revenues are derived
  from the sale of internally developed software titles or software titles licensed
  from third parties. Distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third-party software titles, hardware and accessories. Publishing activities generally
  generate significantly higher margins than distribution activities, with sales
  of PC software titles resulting in higher margins than sales of CDs or cartridges
  designed for video game consoles.

Effective November 1, 2000, in accordance with
  the adoption of SAB 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements”,
  we recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and price protection when
  title and risk of loss pass to customers (generally, upon receipt of products
  by customers). Prior to that date, we recognized revenue upon shipment. In accordance
  with Statement of Position 97-2 “Software Revenue Recognition” we
  recognize revenue when the price is fixed and determinable, upon persuasive
  evidence of an agreement, our fulfillment of our obligations under any such
  agreement and a determination that collection is probable. Our payment arrangements
  with customers provide primarily 60 day terms and to a limited extent with certain
  customers 30 or 90 day terms. We may not have a reliable basis to estimate returns
  and allowances for certain customers or may be unable to determine that collection
  of receivables is probable. In such circumstances, we defer revenue at the time
  of sale and recognize revenue when collection of the related receivable becomes
  probable or cash is collected.

Returns and Reserves

We generally accept returns and grant price
  protection in connection with our publishing arrangements. We establish a reserve
  for future returns of published titles and price protection based primarily
  on historical return rates, return policies and price protection policies, and
  recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and price protection. Our distribution
  arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles
  or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing
  and negotiate accommodations to customers, which includes price discounts, credits
  and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations. The historical
  product return rate for our distribution business has been substantially less
  than for our publishing business. If future returns significantly exceed established
  reserves, our operating results would be adversely affected.

Prepaid Royalties

Our agreements with licensors and developers
  generally provide us with exclusive publishing rights and require us to make
  advance royalty payments that are recouped against royalties due to the licensor
  or developer based on product sales. Prepaid royalties are amortized as cost
  of sales on a title by title basis based on the greater of the proportion of
  current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for that title
  or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales. We continually
  evaluate the recoverability of prepaid royalties and charge to cost of sales
  the amount that management determines is probable that will not be recouped
  at the contractual royalty rate in the period in which such determination is
  made or if we determine that we will cancel a development project. Prepaid royalties
  are classified as current and non-current assets based upon estimated net product
  sales within the next year. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Capitalized Software Development Costs

We capitalize internal software development costs subsequent
  to establishing technological feasibility of a title. Capitalized software development
  costs represent the costs associated with the internal development of our publishing
  products. Amortization of such costs as a component of cost of sales is recorded
  on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current
  year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for the title or the
  straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title.
  We continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs and
  will charge to cost of sales any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable or for
  projects that we will abandon. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

Income tax assets and liabilities are determined by taxable
  jurisdiction. We do not provide taxes on undistributed earnings of our international
  subsidiaries. The total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
  for income tax purposes was approximately $41,900 and $36,000 for the years
  ended October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. It is our intention to reinvest
  undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely
  postpone their remittance. Accordingly, no provision has been made for foreign
  withholding taxes or United States income taxes which may become payable if
  undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends to us.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
  Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-09, Accounting
  for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor’s
  Products, which is a codification of EITF 00-14, 00-22 and 00-25. This EITF
  presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor’s
  products to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor’s products
  and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized
  in the vendor’s income statement and could lead to negative revenue under
  certain circumstances. Revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates
  to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit’s fair value can be
  established. We have early adopted EITF 01-09 effective November 1, 2001. The
  adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated
  condensed financial statements. The prior period financial statements have been
  reclassified in accordance with this statement and as a result, net sales and
  selling and marketing expenses have been reduced by $2,255 for fiscal 2001,
  with no impact on reported net loss.

Effective November 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement
  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations”
  (“SFAS 141”) in its entirety and Statement of Financial Accounting
  Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS
  142”). SFAS 141 requires all business combinations be accounted for using
  the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired
  in a business combination shall be recognized as assets apart from goodwill.
  SFAS 142 addresses the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible
  assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS 142 also addresses the initial
  recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business
  combination whether acquired individually or with a group of other assets. This
  statement provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized
  and that intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill not be amortized,
  but be tested at least annually for impairment. Upon completion of the transitional
  impairment test, the fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded the
  reporting unit’s carry amount and no impairment was indicated.

SFAS 142 requires an annual test for impairment of goodwill,
  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would
  more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
  amount. In assessing potential impairment of goodwill, the Company determines
  the implied fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis
  and compares such values to the respective reporting unit’s carrying amount.
  The Company performs its annual test for indication of goodwill impairment in
  the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. At October 31, 2002, the fair value
  of the Company’s reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts and no impairment
  was indicated.

Business Acquisitions and Dispositions

In November 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding capital
    stock of Angel Studios, Inc., the developer of

Midnight Club

and

Smuggler’s Run

, for $28,500 in cash and 235,679 shares of restricted
    common stock (valued at $6,557). We currently anticipate that this acquisition
    will not have a significant effect on our fiscal 2003 operating results.

In August 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
  of Barking Dog Studios, a Canadian-based development studio, $3,000 in cash
  and for 242,450 shares of restricted common stock.(valued at $3,801). The acquisition
  of Barking Dog did not have a significant effect on our fiscal 2002 operating
  results.

In July 2001, we sold all of the outstanding capital stock of
  Jack of All Games UK, a video game distributor, to Jay Two Limited, an unaffiliated
  third-party controlled by Freightmasters Ltd., for approximately $215. In connection
  with the sale, the purchaser assumed net liabilities of $436. We recorded a
  gain on this sale of $651. The sale of Jack of All Games UK did not have a significant
  effect on our fiscal 2001 or 2002 operating results.

In July 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
  of Techcorp Limited, a Hong Kong based design and engineering firm specializing
  in video game accessories, for 30,000 shares of restricted common stock (valued
  at $572) and $100 in cash. The acquisition of Techcorp did not have a significant
  effect on our fiscal 2001 operating results.

In November 2000, we acquired all of the capital stock of VLM
  Entertainment Group Inc., a third-party video game distributor, for $2,000 in
  cash and 875,000 shares of common stock (valued at $8,039). VLM accounted for
  14.5% of our distribution revenues in fiscal 2001.

In February 2000, we sold Falcon Ventures d/b/a DVDWave.com,
  an online provider of music CDs, to eUniverse, Inc. and recorded a gain of $1,976.
  Falcon Ventures accounted for an insignificant portion of our revenues and accounted
  for an operating loss of approximately $1,100 during fiscal 2000.

We sold Toga Holdings BV to Gameplay.com plc in October 2000.
  During fiscal 2000, Toga’s operations did not contribute to our revenues
  and accounted for an operating loss of approximately $1,500. We incurred a loss
  of $286 in connection with the sale of Toga. In connection with the sale of
  Toga, we entered into a Joint Exploitation Agreement with Gameplay pursuant
  to which we acquired Neo Software Productions GMBH, a software developer based
  in Austria. Neo Software developed

Max Payne

for Microsoft’s Xbox.

We purchased Toga, the parent of Pixel Broadband Studios Ltd.
  in March 2000 as part of our Internet strategy for $4,500 in cash and 2,561,000
  shares of common stock (valued at $35,578). Pixel had developed leading-edge
  software technology, which enabled broadband carriers to deliver persistent
  online gameplay via satellite, cable and wireless communications devices. We
  intended to combine Pixel’s business with the gaming content of our Rockstar
  video game publishing subsidiary with a view toward obtaining financing to operate
  this business independently. Due to unfavorable market conditions, we abandoned
  a proposed financing in July 2000. We incurred a charge of $1,103 consisting
  primarily of professional fees related to the abandoned offering.

We acquired PopTop Software, Inc., an independent software developer,
  in July 2000 for 559,100 shares of common stock (valued at $5,836). PopTop’s
  operations did not contribute to our revenues and its loss did not significantly
  affect our net income during fiscal 2000.

In April 2000, we acquired the remaining 80.1% of the stock
  of Gathering of Developers, Inc. that we did not already own for 1,060,000 shares
  of common stock (valued at $10,402). Prior to the acquisition, we had a distribution
  and publishing arrangement with Gathering under which we were entitled to receive
  a distribution fee of 20% of net receipts derived from sales of PC products.
  Products sold under this arrangement accounted for approximately 6.3% of our
  net sales and 18.0% of our net income for the year ended October 31, 1999, and
  approximately 9.7% of our net sales and 9.3% of our net income during fiscal
  2000.


Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2002 and 2001

Net Sales.

Net sales increased
  by $345,175, or 76.9%, to $793,976 for fiscal 2002 from $448,801 for fiscal
  2001. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in publishing operations.
  Included in net sales for fiscal 2001 was $27,230 attributable to the adoption
  of SAB 101. See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Publishing revenues increased by $326,251, or 134.9%, to $568,089 for fiscal
  2002 from $241,838 for fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily attributable
  to the continued strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto 3

for PlayStation 2
  and the release of

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

for the PlayStation 2,

Max Payne

for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox,

State of Emergency

for
  the PlayStation 2 and

Grand Theft Auto 3

for the PC. Publishing revenues
  represented 71.5% and 53.9% of net sales for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.
  Fiscal 2001 included $20,632 attributable to the adoption of SAB 101.

Products designed for video game console platforms accounted for 83.9% of fiscal
  2002 publishing revenues as compared to 57.5% for fiscal 2001. The increase
  was primarily attributable to continued sales of

Grand Theft Auto 3

for
  PlayStation 2 and the release of

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

for the
  PlayStation 2,

Max Payne

for PlayStation 2 and Xbox and

State of Emergency

for PlayStation 2. Products designed for the PC accounted for approximately
  14.3% of fiscal 2002 publishing revenues as compared to 35.7% for fiscal 2001.
  The decrease is a result of fewer PC titles released during the current year.

Distribution revenues increased by $18,924, or 9.1%, to $225,887 for fiscal
  2002 from $206,963 for fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily attributable
  to the commercial introduction of Xbox and GameCube and the continued rollout
  of PlayStation 2 and the sale of software for these console platforms. Distribution
  revenue represented 28.5% and 46.1% of net sales for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.
  Fiscal 2001 included $6,598 attributable to the adoption of SAB 101.

International operations accounted for approximately $159,245, or 20.1% of
  net sales for fiscal 2002 compared to $106,566 or 23.7% for fiscal 2001. The
  increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to expanded publishing
  operations in Europe, including the release of

Max Payne

and

State
  of Emergency

for PlayStation 2,

Grand Theft Auto 3

for the PC and
  continued sales of

Grand Theft Auto 3

for PlayStation 2. We expect that
  international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our
  revenue.

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

for the PlayStation 2 was released
  in November 2002 in international markets.

Cost of Sales.

Cost of sales increased by $191,678, or 62.6%, to $497,942
  for fiscal 2002 from $306,264 for fiscal 2001. Cost of sales as a percentage
  of net sales decreased to 62.7% for fiscal 2002 from 68.2% for fiscal 2001.

Product costs increased $125,522, or 44.3%, to $409,044 for fiscal 2002 from
  $283,522 from fiscal 2001, but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 51.5%
  for fiscal 2002 from 63.2% for fiscal 2001. The decrease in cost of sales as
  a percentage of net sales was due to the higher proportion of publishing revenues
  which have lower product costs than distribution revenues, partly offset by
  the shift in publishing product mix to higher cost console titles from lower
  cost PC titles. Fiscal 2002 includes $3,064 of litigation settlement costs relating
  to a distribution agreement, while fiscal 2001 includes an impairment charge
  of $3,397 relating to a reduction in the value of certain acquired Internet
  assets. Product costs in fiscal 2001 included $18,335 related to the adoption
  of SAB 101.

Royalties increased $62,201, or 334.9%, to $80,774 for fiscal 2002 from $18,573
  for fiscal 2001. Royalties as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2002 increased
  to 10.2% from 4.1% for fiscal 2001. The increases were due to higher royalty
  payments and increased amortization of prepaid royalties as a result of increased
  product sales, principally for

State of Emergency, Max Payne, Midnight Club

and

Smuggler’s Run.

In addition, we wrote off $14,122 of prepaid
  royalties, principally due to the termination of several projects in 2002. We
  also implemented a royalty program for certain of our development personnel.
  We currently anticipate that this royalty program will constitute a significant
  expense in the foreseeable future.


Software development costs increased $3,955,
    or 94.9%, to $8,124 for fiscal 2002 from $4,169 for fiscal 2001. Software
    development costs as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant
    from year to year. The increase in absolute dollars reflects higher amortization
    principally related to the

Grand Theft Auto

titles. These software
    development costs relate to our internally developed titles.

In future periods, cost of sales may be adversely affected by manufacturing
  and other costs, price competition and by changes in product and sales mix and
  distribution channels.

Selling and Marketing.

Selling and marketing
    expenses increased by $24,992, or 47.2%, to $77,990 for fiscal 2002 from $52,998
    for fiscal 2001. The increase was attributable to television and other advertising
    expenses relating to

Grand Theft Auto 3

,

Max Payne, Grand Theft
    Auto: Vice City

and

Conflict Desert Storm

during fiscal 2002.
    Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales declined to 9.8%
    for fiscal 2002 from 11.8% for fiscal 2001.

General and Administrative.

General and administrative
  expenses increased by $26,677, or 59.5%, to $71,544 for fiscal 2002 from $44,867
  for fiscal 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
  sales declined to 9.0% for fiscal 2002 from 10.0% for fiscal 2001. The increase
  in absolute dollars was attributable to increased personnel expenses primarily
  relating to salaries of additional executive, financial, accounting and information
  technology personnel and legal and professional fees incurred in connection
  with legal proceedings and regulatory matters and litigation settlement costs
  relating to a distribution arrangement.

Research and Development.

Research and development costs
  increased by $5,334, or 86.2% to $11,524 for fiscal 2002 from $6,190 for fiscal
  2001. Research and development costs as a percentage of net sales remained relatively
  constant from year to year. The increase in absolute dollars was attributable
  to bonus compensation, increased staffing levels and the acquisition of Barking
  Dog. Once software development projects reach technological feasibility, which
  is relatively early in the process, a substantial portion of our research and
  development costs are capitalized and subsequently amortized as cost of goods
  sold.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization
  expense of $12,261 for fiscal 2002 decreased $380, or 3.0%, from $12,641 for
  fiscal 2001. The decrease was due to our adoption of SFAS 142, and was partly
  offset by increased costs related to the implementation of a new accounting
  software system and amortization related to the

Max Payne

acquisition.
  Depreciation and amortization expense costs as a percentage of net sales decreased
  to 1.5% for fiscal 2002 from 2.8% for fiscal 2001.

Income from Operations.

Income from operations increased
  by $96,874, or 374.9%, to $122,715 for fiscal 2002 from $25,841 for fiscal 2001,
  due to the changes referred to above.

Interest Expense, net.

Interest expense decreased by
  $8,030, or 94.4%, to $480 for fiscal 2002 from $8,510 for fiscal 2001. The decrease
  was attributable to substantially lower levels of borrowing from our credit
  facilities and interest income earned on invested cash.

Gain on Sale of Subsidiary.

We recorded a non-operating
  gain on the sale of our Jack of All Games UK subsidiary during fiscal 2001.

(Gain) Loss on Internet Investments.

For fiscal 2002,
  we recognized a gain of $181 from the sale of marketable securities. During
  fiscal 2001, we incurred an impairment charge of $21,477 relating primarily
  to our investments in Gameplay and eUniverse to reflect other than temporary
  declines in the value of these investments.

Class Action Settlement Costs.

During fiscal 2002, we
  recorded $1,468 of class action settlement costs, which represents a settlement
  of $7,500 and related legal fees, net of $6,145 of insurance proceeds.

Provision for Income Taxes.

We incurred income tax expense
  of $49,383 for fiscal 2002 as compared to a benefit of $2,200 for fiscal 2001.
  The increase was primarily attributable to increased taxable income. The difference
  between the statutory rate and the effective rates
  of 40.8% and (62.9%) for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively,
  primarily is the result of state and foreign tax rate
  differentials and non-deductible items, such as amortization of intangibles.


At October 31, 2002, we had capital loss carryforwards
  totaling approximately $21,000. The capital loss carryforwards expire in fiscal
  2006. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income from capital transactions
  might affect the ultimate realization of the capital loss carryforwards. If
  this were to occur, management is committed to implementing tax planning strategies,
  such as the sale of our net appreciated assets to the extent required (if any)
  to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of these benefits.

Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of
  Debt.

During fiscal 2001, we incurred an extraordinary charge of $1,948,
  net of taxes, upon the early repayment of $15,000 of subordinated indebtedness.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle.

In connection with the adoption of SAB 101, we recognized a cumulative effect
  of $5,337, net of taxes of $3,558, in fiscal 2001.

Net Income.

For fiscal 2002, we achieved
  net income of $71,565, as compared to net loss of $8,580 for fiscal 2001.

Fiscal Year Ended October 31, 2001 and 2000

Net Sales.

Net sales increased by $84,800,
  or 23.3%, to $448,801 for fiscal 2001 from $364,001 for fiscal 2000. The increase
  was attributable to growth in both publishing and distribution operations and
  acquisitions. The adoption of SAB 101 effective November 2000 to recognize revenue
  when both title and all risks of loss pass to customers resulted in an increase
  in net sales of $27,230. Fiscal 2000 sales that were previously recognized upon
  product shipment were effectively reversed with the adoption of SAB 101 and
  reported upon receipt by the customer as sales in the first quarter of fiscal
  2001. In fiscal 2001, we implemented changes to our practices to significantly
  reduce shipment time near quarter and year end.

Publishing revenues increased by $55,720 or 29.9%,
  to $241,838 for fiscal 2001 from $186,118 for fiscal 2000. The increase was
  primarily attributable to the release of

Grand Theft Auto 3

for PlayStation
  2 and

Max Payne

for the PC, and included $20,632 resulting from the adoption
  of SAB 101. Publishing activities accounted for approximately 53.9% of net sales
  in fiscal 2001.

In fiscal 2001, software titles designed for PC
  platforms accounted for approximately 35.7% of publishing revenues as compared
  to 36.9% in the prior year. Software titles designed for video game console
  platforms accounted for 57.5% of publishing revenues as compared to 50.6% in
  the prior year. We expect that sales of video game console titles will continue
  to account for an increasing portion of our publishing revenues.

Distribution revenues increased by $29,080, or
  16.3%, to $206,963 for fiscal 2001 from $177,883 for fiscal 2000. The increase
  was attributable to the continued rollout of Sony’s PlayStation 2, and
  included $6,598 relating to the adoption of SAB 101. VLM Entertainment Group,
  which was acquired in November 2000, accounted for 14.5% of our distribution
  revenues in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, distribution activities accounted for
  approximately 46.1% of net sales, with video game hardware and peripherals accounting
  for 20.1% of net sales.

International operations accounted for approximately
  $106,566 or 23.7% of net sales in fiscal 2001 compared to $103,315 or 28.4%
  in fiscal 2000. The percentage decrease was attributable to the growth in our
  North American operations. In recent periods, we placed increasing emphasis
  on expanding publishing activities in Europe, and we sold our Jack of All Games
  UK distribution subsidiary in July 2001.

Cost of Sales.

Cost of sales increased by
  $70,286, or 29.8%, to $306,264 for fiscal 2001 from $235,978 for fiscal 2000.
  Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 68.2% for fiscal 2001
  from 64.8% for fiscal 2000.


Product costs increased $66,345, or 30.5%, to $283,522
  for fiscal 2001 from $217,177 for fiscal 2000, and increased as a percentage
  of net sales to 63.2% for fiscal 2001 from 59.6% for fiscal 2000. The increases
  reflect higher production costs associated with the development of next-generation
  software titles and the shift in publishing product mix to higher cost console
  titles from lower cost PC titles. The 2001 period includes a non-cash impairment
  charge of $3,397 relating to a reduction in the value of certain Internet assets.
  Product costs in fiscal 2001 included $18,335 related to the adoption of SAB
  101.

Royalties increased $1,223, or 7.0%, to $18,573
  for fiscal 2001 from $17,350 from the comparable period in the prior year. Royalties
  as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2001 decreased to 4.1% from 4.8% for the
  comparable period in 2000. The increase in absolute dollars was due to higher
  amortization and write-downs. The decrease in royalties as a percentage of net
  sales was due primarily to sales of internally developed products.

Software development costs increased $2,718, or
    187.3%, to $4,169 for fiscal 2001 from $1,451 for fiscal 2000. Software development
    costs as a percentage of net sales increased to 0.9% in fiscal 2001 from 0.4%
    in fiscal 2000. The increases reflect higher amortization due to sales of
    internally developed titles and the 2001 write-down of $389 relating to impairment
    in the value of certain Internet assets.

Selling and Marketing.

Selling and marketing
  expenses increased by $10,144, or 23.7%, to $52,998 for fiscal 2001 from $42,854
  for fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased advertising
  activities relating to our new releases in 2001. Selling and marketing expenses
  as a percentage of net sales remained constant from year to year.

General and Administrative.

General and
  administrative expenses increased by $8,458, or 23.2%, to $44,867 for fiscal
  2001 from $36,409 for fiscal 2000. General and administrative expenses as a
  percentage of net sales remained constant from year to year at 10.0%. The increase
  in absolute dollars was attributable to increased salaries and rent necessary
  to support our expanded operations and increased bad debt expenses.

Research and Development.

Research and development
  costs increased by $522, or 9.2%, to $6,190 for fiscal 2001 from $5,668 for
  fiscal 2000. Research and development costs as a percentage of net sales remained
  relatively constant from year to year.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation
  and amortization expense increased by $3,961, or 45.6%, to $12,641 for fiscal
  2001 from $8,680 for fiscal 2000. Depreciation and amortization expense as a
  percentage of net sales increased to 2.8% for fiscal 2001 from 2.4% for fiscal
  2000. The increases were attributable to amortization of intangible assets as
  a result of business acquisitions offset by the impact of sales of businesses
  made in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001.

Income from Operations.

Income from operations
  decreased by $7,468, or 22.4%, to $25,841 for fiscal 2001 from $33,309 for fiscal
  2000 due to the changes referred to above .

Interest Expense, net.

Interest expense
  increased by $2,441, or 40.2% to $8,510 for fiscal 2001 from $6,069 for fiscal
  2000. The increase was attributable to higher levels of borrowings during 2001.
  Interest expense as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant from
  year to year.

Gain on Sale of Subsidiary.

We sold Jack
  of All Games UK in July 2001 and recorded a gain on sale of $651. Fiscal 2000
  includes a gain of $1,976 relating to the sale of Falcon Ventures, partly offset
  by a $286 loss relating to the sale of Toga Holdings.

(Gain) Loss on Internet Investments.

We
  incurred non-cash impairment charges of $21,477 during fiscal 2001 relating
  to our Internet related investments to reflect other than temporary declines
  in the value of such investments.

Income Taxes.

Income tax expense decreased
  by $4,744 for fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000. The decrease was attributable to
  tax losses in fiscal 2001 compared to taxable income in fiscal 2000. We recorded
  an income tax benefit of $2,200 for fiscal 2001 compared to an income
  tax provision of $2,544 for fiscal 2000. The difference between the statutory
  and effective tax rate in 2001 and 2000 of (62.9%) and 28.4%, respectively,
  is the result of state and foreign tax rate differentials partially offset by
  non-deductible items, such as amortization of goodwill and intangible assets.


Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of
  Debt.

We incurred an extraordinary charge of $1,948, net of taxes of $1,217,
  upon the early extinguishment of debt of $15,000 in July 2001.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle.

In connection with our adoption of SAB 101, we recognized a cumulative effect
  of $5,337, net of taxes of $3,558.

Net income (loss).

As a result of the foregoing,
  for fiscal 2001, we incurred a net loss of $8,580 as compared to net income
  of $6,417 for fiscal 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements have been and will
  continue to be to fund developing, manufacturing, publishing and distributing
  our products. We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements
  primarily through cash flow from operations, the issuance of equity securities
  and bank borrowings. At October 31, 2002, we had working capital of $197,453
  as compared to working capital of $92,690 at October 31, 2001.

Our cash and cash equivalents increased $102,313
  to $108,369 at October 31, 2002, from $6,056 at October 31, 2001. The increase
  is primarily attributable to $144,998 of cash provided by operating activities,
  partly offset by $18,084 used in investing activities and by $31,988 used in
  financing activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities for
  fiscal 2002 was $144,998 compared to $27,319 of cash provided for fiscal 2001
  and $54,230 of cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2000. The increase
  in cash provided was primarily attributable to increased net income in 2002
  and our focus on working capital management in both fiscal 2002 and 2001. The
  increase in cash provided from operations for fiscal 2002 was also attributable
  to increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partly offset by increased
  levels of inventories, prepaid expenses and accounts receivable. In fiscal 2000,
  we invested substantial funds in our next-generation entertainment software
  publishing subsidiaries and products. We believe that such investments will
  continue to be reflected in future cash flow from operations.

Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal
  2002 was $18,084 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $13,479
  for fiscal 2001 and $12,906 in fiscal 2000. The increase in 2002 is primarily
  attributable to the acquisition of the

Max Payne

intangible assets and
  the Barking Dog development studio and increased expenditures for fixed assets.
  Net cash used in investing activities in 2001 related primarily to the purchase
  of fixed assets and to a lesser extent acquisitions. Net cash used in investing
  activities in 2000 related primarily to acquisitions.

Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal
  2002 was $31,988, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $11,790
  for fiscal 2001 and net cash provided by financing activities of $70,535 for
  fiscal 2000. The increase in net cash used in financing activities for fiscal
  2002 was primarily attributable to the absence of private placement proceeds
  this year and the repayment of indebtedness. Net cash used in fiscal 2001 related
  primarily to the repayment of indebtedness offset by proceeds from equity offerings
  and the exercise of stock options and warrants. Net cash provided by financing
  activities in fiscal 2000 was primarily due to proceeds from borrowings and
  equity offerings.

In December 1999, we entered into a credit agreement,
  as amended and restated in August 2002, with a group of lenders led by Bank
  of America, N.A., as agent. The agreement provides for borrowings of up to $40,000
  through the expiration of the line of credit on August 28, 2005. Generally,
  advances under the line of credit are based on a borrowing formula equal to
  75% of eligible accounts receivable plus 35% of eligible inventory. Interest
  accrues on such advances at the bank’s prime rate plus 0.25% to 1.25%,
  or at LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75% depending on our consolidated leverage ratio
  (as defined). We are required to pay a commitment fee to the bank equal to 0.5%
  of the


unused loan balance. Borrowings under the line
  of credit are collateralized by our accounts receivable, inventory, equipment,
  general intangibles, securities and other personal property, including the capital
  stock of our domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under the agreement are reduced
  by the amount of outstanding letters of credit, which were $5,546 at October
  31, 2002. The loan agreement contains certain financial and other covenants,
  including the maintenance of consolidated net worth, consolidated leverage ratio
  and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. As of October 31, 2002, we were
  in compliance with such covenants. The loan agreement limits or prohibits us
  from declaring or paying cash dividends, merging or consolidating with another
  corporation, selling assets (other than in the ordinary course of business),
  creating liens and incurring additional indebtedness. We had no outstanding
  borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of October 31, 2002.

In February 2001, our United Kingdom subsidiary
  entered into a credit facility agreement, as amended in March 2002, with Lloyds
  TSB Bank plc (“Lloyds”) under which Lloyds agreed to make available
  borrowings of up to approximately $20,500. Advances under the credit facility
  bear interest at the rate of 1.25% per annum over the bank’s base rate,
  and are guaranteed by us. Borrowings under the agreement are reduced by the
  amount of outstanding guarantees, which were $235 at October 31, 2002. The facility
  expires on March 31, 2004. We had no outstanding borrowings under this facility
  as of October 31, 2002.

For fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, we received proceeds
  of $23,308, $22,931 and $6,921, respectively, relating to the exercise of stock
  options and warrants.

In July 2000, we entered into a subordinated loan
  agreement with Finova Mezzanine Capital under which we borrowed $15,000, evidenced
  by a five-year promissory note bearing interest at a rate of 12.5% per annum,
  payable monthly. In connection with the loan, we issued to Finova warrants to
  purchase 451,747 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $11.875 per
  share. We incurred an extraordinary charge of $1,948, net of taxes, upon the
  early repayment of this indebtedness in July 2001.

In November 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding
  capital stock of Angel Studios, Inc. for $28,500 in cash and 235,679 shares
  of restricted common stock (valued at $6,557).

Our accounts receivable, less an allowance for
  doubtful accounts, returns and price protection at October 31, 2002 was $108,441.
  Of such receivables, two retail customers, Wal-Mart and Best Buy, accounted
  for 13.7% and 10.0%, respectively, of the receivable balance at October 31,
  2002. Most of our receivables are covered by insurance, with certain limits,
  in the event of a customer’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, we have
  been able to collect our receivables in the ordinary course of business. We
  do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers. As a result, we
  are subject to credit risks, particularly in the event that any of the receivables
  represent a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets.
  If we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due and such
  accounts are not covered by insurance, we could be required to increase our
  allowance for doubtful accounts, which could adversely affect our liquidity
  and working capital position. We had accounts receivable days outstanding of
  45 days for the three months ended October 31, 2002, as compared to 70 days
  for the three months ended October 31, 2001.

In September 2002, we relocated our principal
  executive offices to 622 Broadway, New York, New York. We estimate that we will
  incur approximately $4,000 in capital expenditures for renovations and leasehold
  improvements. In connection with signing a ten year lease, we provided a standby
  letter of credit of $1,560, expiring December 31, 2003. As a result of the relocation,
  during fiscal 2002, we recorded expenses of $514 related to lease costs with
  regard to our former executive offices. In addition, we expect to spend approximately
  $2,000 in connection with the implementation of accounting software systems
  in our international operations. We have no other material commitments for capital
  expenditures.

We may continue to incur significant legal, accounting
  and other professional fees and expenses in connection with pending regulatory
  matters.


Based on our currently proposed operating plans
  and assumptions, we believe that projected cash flow from operations and available
  cash resources, including amounts available under our lines of credit, will
  be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the reasonably foreseeable
  future.

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities
  and Commitments

Our offices and warehouse facilities are occupied
  under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various times from January
  2003 to October 2011. We also lease certain furniture, equipment and automobiles
  under non-cancelable leases expiring through July 2005. Our future minimum rental
  payments for the year ending October 31, 2003 are $6,210 and aggregate minimum
  rental payments through applicable lease expirations are $33,677.

During fiscal 2002, we entered into distribution
  agreements under which we purchase various software games. These agreements,
  which expire between April 1, 2003 and September 30, 2004, require minimum guaranteed
  aggregate payments of $13,595 at October 31, 2002. These agreements are collateralized
  by standby letters of credit of $3,986 at October 31, 2002. Additionally, assuming
  performance by third-party developers, we have outstanding commitments under
  various software development agreements to pay developers an aggregate of $19,129
  during fiscal 2003.

In connection with our acquisition of the publishing
  rights to the franchise of

Duke Nukem

PC and video games in December
  2000, we are contingently obligated to pay $6,000 in cash upon delivery of the
  final version of

Duke Nukem Forever

for the PC. In addition, in connection
  with our acquisition of the

Max Payne

product franchise, we are contingently
  liable to make aggregate payments of up to $8,000 in cash upon the timely delivery
  of the final version of

Max Payne 2

for the PC and the achievement of
  certain sales targets for such product. The payables will be recorded when the
  contingencies are resolved.

Fluctuations in Operating Results and Seasonality

We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly
  operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles;
  variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms; market acceptance
  of our titles; development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction
  of new titles, sequels or enhancements of existing titles; projected and actual
  changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors;
  product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors; the
  accuracy of retailers’ forecasts of consumer demand; the size and timing
  of acquisitions; the timing of orders from major customers; and order cancellations
  and delays in product shipment. Sales of our titles are also seasonal, with
  peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter (our fourth
  and first fiscal quarters) as a result of increased demand for titles during
  the holiday season. Quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily
  indicative of future operating results.

International Operations

Sales in international markets, principally in
  the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant
  portion of our net sales. For fiscal 2002 and 2001, sales in international markets
  accounted for approximately 20.1% and 23.7%, respectively, of our net sales.
  We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit
  risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
  shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments,
  all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Obligations Associated with
  the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 143”). The objective
  of SFAS 143 is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated
  with the retirement of long-lived assets. The retirement obligations included
  within the scope of this pronouncement are those that an entity cannot avoid
  as a result of either the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a
  long-lived asset. Components of larger systems also fall under
  this pronouncement, as well as tangible long-lived
  assets with indeterminable lives. The provisions of SFAS 143 are effective for
  financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.
  The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact of the adoption of SFAS
  143 on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
  The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.


In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
  Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
  or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”). The objectives
  of SFAS 144 are to address significant issues relating to the implementation
  of SFAS 121 and to develop a single accounting model, based on the framework
  established in SFAS 121, for the long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale,
  whether previously held and used or newly acquired. The provisions of SFAS 144
  are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
  December 15, 2001. We are currently evaluating the expected impact of the adoption
  of SFAS 144 on our financial condition and results of operations. We will adopt
  the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
  and 64, Amendment to FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
  (“SFAS 145”). SFAS 145 eliminates the requirement (in SFAS No. 4)
  that gains and losses from the extinguishments of debt be aggregated and classified
  as extraordinary items, net of the related income tax. The rescission of SFAS
  No. 4 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, which for
  us would be November 1, 2002. Upon adoption, the $1,948 loss on extinguishment
  of debt that was previously classified as an extraordinary item will be reclassified
  to non-operating expenses. We do not expect that the rescission of SFAS No.
  4 will have a material impact on our financial condition, cash flows or results
  of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
  or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 requires the recognition
  of such costs when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment
  to an exit or disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are to be applied prospectively
  to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We are currently
  evaluating the expected impact of the adoption of SFAS 146 on our financial
  condition, cash flows and results of operations.

The market for interactive entertainment software
  titles is characterized by short product life cycles.

The interactive entertainment
  software market is characterized by short product life cycles and frequent introduction
  of new products. New products introduced by us may not achieve significant market
  acceptance or achieve sufficient sales to permit us to recover development,
  manufacturing and associated costs. Historically, few interactive entertainment
  software products have achieved sustained market acceptance. Even the most successful
  titles remain popular for only limited periods of time, often less than six
  months. The life cycle of a game generally consists of a relatively high level
  of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a decline
  in sales. Because revenues associated with the initial shipments of a new product
  generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with
  the life of a product, any delay in the introduction of one or more new products
  could harm our operating results. Additionally, because we introduce a relatively
  limited number of new products in a given period, the failure of one or more
  of our products to achieve market acceptance could result in losses.

A significant portion of our revenues is derived
  from a limited number of titles.

Our ten best selling titles accounted for
  approximately 59.9% of our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2002, with

Grand Theft Auto 3

for the PlayStation 2 accounting for 30.0% of our
  revenues,

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

for PlayStation 2 accounting for
  7.6% of our revenues and

Max Payne

for the
  PlayStation 2 accounting for 6.7% of our revenues. Our ten best selling titles
  accounted for approximately 31.4% of our revenues for the year ended October
  31, 2001. For this period,

Grand Theft Auto 3

for the PlayStation 2 accounted
  for 7.4% of our revenues;

Midnight Club

for the PlayStation 2 accounted
  for 4.2% of our revenues;

Smuggler’s Run

for the PlayStation 2 accounted
  for 3.0% of our revenues; and

Max Payne

for the PC accounted for 5.2%
  of our revenues, with each of the next three titles accounting for between 1.9%
  and 3.0% of our revenues. Our ten best selling titles accounted for 16.4% of
  our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2000. Each of

Grand Theft Auto,
  Midnight Club

and the

Smuggler’s Run

titles accounted for approximately
  3.0% of our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2000, with each of the next
  four titles accounting for between 1.2% and 2.3% of our revenues. Our future
  titles may not be commercially viable. If we fail to continue to develop and
  sell new, commercially successful titles, our revenues and profits may decrease
  substantially and we may incur losses.


Our quarterly operating results may vary significantly,
  which could cause our stock price to decline.

We have experienced and may
  continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results. The
  interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales typically
  higher during the fourth and first calendar quarters, due primarily to the increased
  demand for games during and immediately following the holiday buying season.
  Our failure or inability to introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal
  fluctuations in demand will harm our business and operating results. These fluctuations
  could also cause our stock price to decline. Other factors that cause fluctuations
  include:

•

delays in the introduction of new titles;

•

the size and timing of product and corporate
      acquisitions;

•

variations in sales of titles designed to
      operate on particular platforms;

•

development and promotional expenses relating
      to the introduction of new titles;

•

sequels or enhancements of existing titles;

•

availability of hardware platforms;

•

the timing and success of title introductions
      by our competitors;

•

product returns;

•

the accuracy of retailers’ forecasts
      of consumer demand; and

•

the timing of orders from major customers.

Our expense levels are based, in part, on our
  expectations regarding future sales and therefore our operating results would
  be harmed by a decrease in sales or a failure to meet our sales expectations.
  The uncertainties associated with interactive entertainment software development,
  lengthy manufacturing lead times, production delays and the approval process
  for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult
  to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause
  us to fail to meet financial expectations. In future quarters our operating
  results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors.
  In this event, the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline.

The interactive entertainment software industry
  is cyclical, and we may fail to anticipate changing consumer preferences.

Our
  business is subject to all of the risks generally associated with the interactive
  entertainment software industry, which has been cyclical in nature and has been
  characterized by periods of significant growth followed by rapid declines. Our
  future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond our control,
  including:

•

the popularity, price and timing of new software
      and hardware platforms being released and distributed by us and our competitors;

•

international, national and regional economic
      conditions, particularly economic conditions adversely affecting discretionary
      consumer spending;

•

changes in consumer demographics;

•

the availability of other forms of entertainment;
      and

•

critical reviews and public tastes and preferences,
      all of which change rapidly and cannot be predicted.


In order to plan for acquisition and promotional
  activities we must anticipate and respond to rapid changes in consumer tastes
  and preferences. A decline in the popularity of interactive entertainment software
  or particular platforms could cause sales of our titles to decline dramatically.
  The period of time necessary to develop new game titles, obtain approvals of
  manufacturers and produce CD-ROMs or game cartridges is unpredictable. During
  this period, consumer appeal of a particular title may decrease, causing sales
  to decline.

Rapidly changing technology and platform shifts
  could hurt our operating results.

The interactive entertainment industry
  in general is associated with rapidly changing technology, which often leads
  to software and platform obsolescence and significant price erosion over the
  life of a product. The introduction of new platforms and technologies can render
  existing software titles obsolete or unmarketable. As more advanced platforms
  achieve market acceptance, consumer demand for software for older platforms
  declines. Obsolescence of software or platforms could leave us with increased
  inventories of unsold titles and limited amounts of new titles to sell to consumers,
  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

We are devoting development resources primarily
  on products designed for Sony’s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft’s Xbox.
  If consumer demand for these platforms declines as a result of the next hardware
  transition cycle, we may experience lower than expected sales or losses from
  products designed for these platforms.

A number of software publishers who compete with
  us have developed or are currently developing software for use by consumers
  over the Internet. Future increases in the availability of such software or
  technological advances in such software or the Internet could result in a decline
  in platform-based software and impact our sales. Direct sales of software by
  major manufacturers over the Internet would materially adversely affect our
  distribution business.

Our business is dependent on licensing and publishing
  arrangements with third parties.

Our success depends on our ability to identify
  and develop new titles on a timely basis. We have entered into agreements with
  third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment
  software. These agreements typically require us to make advance payments, pay
  royalties and satisfy other conditions. Our advance payments may not be sufficient
  to permit developers to develop new software successfully. In addition, software
  development costs, promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to
  software developers have increased significantly in recent years and reduce
  the potential profits derived from sales of our software. Future sales of our
  titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers, and
  we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual
  commitments. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under these license agreements,
  the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that may be burdensome
  to us.

Returns of our published titles and markdown
  allowances may adversely affect our operating results.

We are exposed to
  the risk of product returns and markdown allowances with respect to our customers.
  Our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the
  right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders; however, at our discretion,
  we may accept product returns for stock balancing or defective products. In
  addition, we sometimes negotiate accommodations to customers, including price
  discounts, credits and product returns, when demand for specific products falls
  below expectations. We generally accept returns and grant price protection
  in connection with our publishing arrangements. We establish a reserve for future returns and markdown
  allowances for published titles based primarily on these
  return policies and historical return rates, and we report our revenues net
  of returns. If return rates and markdown allowances for our published titles
  significantly exceed our reserves, our revenues will decline and we could incur
  losses.

The interactive entertainment software industry
  is highly competitive.

We compete for both licenses to properties and the
  sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo,
  each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms.
  Each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant
  price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns, particularly
  for prime-time television spots. These companies may also increase their own
  software development efforts or focus on developing software products for third-party
  platforms. We also compete with domestic and international companies, large
  software companies and media companies. Some of our competitors have greater
  financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, and are able
  to carry larger inventories, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make
  higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially
  desirable properties than we can. Our titles, also compete with other forms of
  entertainment such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products
  featuring similar themes, online computer programs and forms of entertainment
  which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.


Our distribution business also operates in a highly
  competitive environment. The intense competition that characterizes our industry
  is based primarily on breadth, availability and quality of product lines; price;
  terms and conditions of sale; credit terms and availability; speed and accuracy
  of delivery; and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs. Our competitors
  include regional, national and international distributors, as well as hardware
  manufacturers and software publishers. We may lose market share or be forced
  in the future to reduce our prices in response to the actions of our competitors,
  and thereby experience a reduction in our gross margins.

Increased competition for limited shelf space
  and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business
  and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles.

Retailers
  have limited shelf space and promotional resources, and competition is intense
  among an increasing number of newly introduced interactive entertainment software
  titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support. Competition
  for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase
  our marketing expenditures just to maintain current levels of sales of our titles.
  Competitors with more extensive lines and popular titles frequently have greater
  bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve
  the levels of promotional support and shelf space that such competitors receive.

Rating systems for interactive entertainment
  software, potential legislation and consumer opposition could inhibit sales
  of our products.

Trade organizations within the video game industry require
  interactive entertainment software publishers to provide consumers with information
  relating to graphic violence, profanity or sexually explicit material contained
  in software titles. Certain countries have also established similar rating systems
  as prerequisites for sales of interactive entertainment software in such countries.
  In some instances, we may be required to modify our products to comply with
  the requirements of such governmental entities, which could delay the release
  of those products in such countries. We believe that we comply with such rating
  systems and properly display the ratings received for our titles.

Historically, our software titles received a rating
  of “E” (age 6 and older) or “T” (age 13 and over), although
  many of our new titles (including

Grand Theft Auto 3, Grand Theft Auto: Vice
  City, Max Payne and State of Emergency

) have received a rating of “M”
  (age 17 and over). Certain retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment
  software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material, which may
  limit the potential market for our “M” rated products.

Several proposals have been made for federal legislation
  to regulate the interactive entertainment software, motion picture and recording
  industries, including a proposal to adopt a common rating system for interactive
  entertainment software, television and music containing violence and sexually
  explicit material, and the Federal Trade Commission has adopted rules with respect
  to the marketing of such material to minors. Consumer advocacy groups have also
  opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence
  and sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas and
  by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns. If any groups were
  to target our “M” rated titles, we might be required to significantly
  change or discontinue a particular title which in the case of our best selling
  titles could hurt our business.

We cannot publish our console titles without
  the approval of hardware manufacturers.

We are required to obtain a license
  to develop and publish titles for each hardware platform for which we develop
  and publish titles. Our existing hardware console platform licenses require
  that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title-by-title
  basis. As a result, the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware
  platforms, along with our ability to time the release of these titles and, accordingly,
  our revenues from titles for these hardware platforms, may be limited. If any
  manufacturer chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end
  of its current term, or if the manufacturer were to terminate our license for
  any reason, we would be unable to publish additional titles for that manufacturer’s
  hardware platform.


License agreements relating to these rights generally
  extend for a term of three years. The agreements are terminable upon the occurrence
  of a number of factors, including: (1) breach of the agreement by us; (2) our
  bankruptcy or insolvency; or (3) our entry into a relationship with, or acquisition
  by, a competitor of the manufacturer. We cannot assure you that we will be able
  to obtain new or maintain existing licenses on acceptable terms, or at all.

We are dependent upon a license agreement with
  Sony to publish titles for PlayStation 2. The term of the license agreement
  expires in March 2003 and is automatically extended, unless terminated by one
  of the parties, for additional successive one-year terms. Termination of such
  agreement would seriously hurt our business.

Sony and Nintendo are the sole manufacturers of
  the titles we publish under license from them. Games for the Xbox must be manufactured
  by pre-approved manufacturers. Each platform license provides that the manufacturer
  may raise prices for the titles at any time and grants the manufacturer substantial
  control over the release of new titles. Each of these manufacturers also publishes
  software for its own platforms and manufactures titles for all of its other
  licensees and may choose to give priority to its own titles or those of other
  publishers if it has insufficient manufacturing capacity or if there is increased
  demand.

In addition, these manufacturers may not have sufficient
  production capacity to satisfy our scheduling requirements during any period
  of sustained demand. If manufacturers do not supply us with finished titles
  on favorable terms without delays, our operations would be materially interrupted,
  and we would be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of our product to sell to
  our customers. If we cannot obtain sufficient product amounts, our revenues
  will decline and we could incur losses.

We may not be able to protect our proprietary
  rights or avoid claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of others.

We develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish
  and distribute software developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our
  software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret
  laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and
  distribution. Interactive entertainment software is susceptible to unauthorized
  copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer
  our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we
  regard as proprietary.

As the amount of interactive entertainment software
  titles in the market increases and the functionality of this software further
  overlaps, we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly
  become the subject of claims that such software infringes the copyrights or
  patents of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties
  alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that
  our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third-party
  developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and
  will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that
  infringement of proprietary rights of others has or may occur. Any claims of
  infringement, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, costly and difficult
  to defend. Intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue
  the distribution of products, obtain a license or redesign our products, which
  could result in additional costs and delays.

We are dependent on third-party software developers
  to complete certain of our titles.

We rely on third-party software developers
  for the development of certain of our titles. Quality third-party developers
  are continually in high demand. Software developers who have developed titles
  for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future.
  Due to the limited number of third-party software developers and the limited
  control that we exercise over them, these developers may not be able to complete
  titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards, if at
  all.

We depend on third-party software developers and
  our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software
  within anticipated release schedules and cost projections. In addition, the
  development cycle for new titles is long, typically ranging from twelve to twenty-four
  months. After development of a product, it may take between six to twelve additional
  months to develop the product for other hardware platforms. If developers experience
  financial difficulties, additional costs or unanticipated development delays,
  we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule.


Our software is susceptible to errors, which
  can harm our financial results and reputation.

The technological advancements
  of new hardware platforms allow more complex software products. As software
  products become more complex, the risk of undetected errors in products when
  first introduced increases. If, despite testing, errors are found in new products
  or releases after shipments have been made, we could experience a loss of or
  delay in timely market acceptance, product returns, loss of revenues and damage
  to our reputation.

Gross margins relating to our distribution business
  have been historically narrow which increases the impact of variations in costs
  on our operating results.

As a result of intense price competition in the
  console hardware and software distribution industry, our gross margins in our
  distribution business have historically been narrow and we expect them to continue
  to be narrow in the future. We receive purchase discounts from suppliers based
  on various factors, including volume purchases. These purchase discounts directly
  affect our gross margins. It may become more difficult for us to achieve the
  percentage growth in sales required to continue to receive volume purchase discounts.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our
  cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense
  is comprised of personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline
  in revenues, we may not be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, or make
  other significant changes to our cost structure without significant disruption
  to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs. Management
  may not be able to implement such actions, if at all, in a timely manner to
  offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and gross profit.

Our distribution business is dependent on suppliers
  to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely
  basis.

Our ability to obtain particular products in required quantities
  and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success.
  In most cases, we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with suppliers.
  In certain product categories, limited price protection or return rights offered
  by manufacturers may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing
  to purchase. The console hardware industry experiences significant product supply
  shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to
  supply certain products on a timely basis. As a result, we have experienced,
  and may in the future continue to experience, short-term hardware inventory
  shortages. In addition, manufacturers who currently distribute their products
  through us may decide to distribute, or to substantially increase their existing
  distribution, through other distributors, or directly to retailers

We are subject to the risk that our inventory
  values may decline and protective terms under supplier arrangements may not
  adequately cover the decline in values.

The interactive entertainment software
  and hardware industry is subject to rapid technological change, new and enhanced
  generations of products, and evolving industry standards. These changes may
  cause inventory to decline substantially in value or to become obsolete. We
  are also exposed to inventory risk to the extent that supplier price protections
  are not available on all products or quantities and are subject to time restrictions.
  In addition, suppliers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill price protection
  obligations.

A limited number of customers may account for
  a significant portion of our sales.

Sales to our five largest customers
  accounted for approximately 31.4% of our revenues for the year ended October
  31, 2002, 21.0.% of our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2001, and 22.7%
  of our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2000. Our sales are made primarily
  pursuant to purchase orders without long-term agreements or other commitments.
  Our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time. The loss
  of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal
  customers could harm our operating results. Bankruptcies or consolidations of
  certain large retail customers could also hurt our business.

We are subject to credit and collection risks.

Our sales are typically made on credit, with terms that vary depending upon
  the customer and the demand for the particular title being sold. We do not hold
  any collateral to secure payment by our customers. As a result, we are subject
  to credit risks, particularly in the event that any of our receivables represent
  sales to a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets.
  If we are unable to collect on accounts receivable as they become due and such
  accounts are not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial
  condition.


We are subject to risks and uncertainties of
  international trade.

Sales in international markets, primarily in the United
  Kingdom and other countries in Europe and the Pacific Rim, have accounted for
  a significant portion of our revenues. Sales in international markets accounted
  for approximately 20.1% of our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2002,
  23.7% of our revenues for the year ended October 31, 2001 and 28.4% of our revenues
  for the year ended October 31, 2000. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign
  trade, including increased credit risks; tariffs and duties; fluctuations in
  foreign currency exchange rates; shipping delays; and international political,
  regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact
  on our operating results. All of our international sales are made in local currencies.

We depend on skilled personnel.

Our success
  depends on our ability to identify, hire and retain qualified management, creative,
  development, financial, marketing, sales and technical personnel. If we are
  unable to continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, our business and
  prospects would be negatively affected.

The market price for our common stock may be
  highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been and may continue
  to be highly volatile.
  Factors such as our operating results, announcements by us or our competitors
  and various factors affecting the interactive entertainment software industry
  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
  About Market Risk

(Dollars
  in thousands)

We are subject to market risks in the ordinary
  course of our business, primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign
  currency fluctuations and possible impairment of the carrying values of our
  investments.

Historically, fluctuations in interest rates have
  not had a significant impact on our operating results. At October 31, 2002,
  we had no outstanding variable rate indebtedness.

We transact business in foreign currencies and
  are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
  rates. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into United States
  dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant fiscal quarter or year
  end. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders’
  equity. For the year ended October 31, 2002, our foreign currency translation
  adjustment gain was $5,553. Foreign exchange transaction gain for the year ended
  October 31, 2002 was $840. A hypothetical 10% change in applicable currency
  exchange rates at October 31, 2002 would result in a material translation adjustment.

In addition, we may be exposed to risk of loss
  associated with fluctuations in the value of our investments. Our investments
  are stated at fair value, with net unrealized appreciation and loss included
  as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We regularly review the
  carrying values of our investments to identify and record impairment losses
  when events or circumstances indicate that such investments may be permanently
  impaired.

At October 31, 2002, we held 6,869,407 shares of
  common stock of Gameplay.com plc with a fair value of approximately $97 and
  that is classified as a non-current asset. We recorded an unrealized loss of
  $14, net of taxes of $9 as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
  income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. For the year ended October 31, 2001,
  we recorded a loss of $19,171 to reflect the other than temporary impairment
  of our investments relating to Gameplay.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Take-Two Interactive Software,
  Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
  listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the
  financial position of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries
  (“the Company”) at October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001, and the
  results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
  in the period ended October 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
  generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
  the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index, presents
  fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read
  in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
  statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
  management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
  and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
  of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
  in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the
  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
  are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
  assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
  and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
  our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2, effective November 1,
  2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
  Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations” in its entirety and Statement
  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
  Assets”. Accordingly, the Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill
  as of that date. Also, as discussed in Note 2, effective November 1, 2000, the
  Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition to conform
  to the requirements of SEC Staff Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue Recognition”.

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (the “Company”)
  was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 1993. The Company develops
  interactive software games designed for PCs and video game console platforms
  and publishes games developed internally and by third- parties. The Company
  also distributes games for video game consoles published by third-parties, as
  well as hardware and accessories manufactured by third-parties.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
  financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company
  balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain amounts in the financial statements of
  the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation
  for comparative purposes.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
  with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
  statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
  periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability
  of prepaid royalties, capitalized software development costs and other intangibles,
  inventories, realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances
  for returns, price protection and doubtful accounts. Actual amounts could differ
  significantly from these estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

A significant portion of the Company’s cash
  balance is maintained with several major financial institutions. While the Company
  attempts to limit credit exposure with any single institution, there are times
  that balances will exceed insurable amounts.

If the financial condition and operations of the
  Company’s customers deteriorate, the risk of collection could increase
  substantially. As of October 31, 2002 and 2001, the receivable balances from
  the Company’s five largest customers amounted to approximately 42.4% and
  40.4% of the Company’s net receivable balance, respectively, with two customers
  representing 13.7% and 10.0% at October 31, 2002 and two customers representing
  11.6% and 10.3% at October 31, 2001. For the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001,
  and 2000, the Company’s five largest customers accounted for 31.4%, 21.0%,
  and 22.7% of net sales, respectively. Except for the largest customers noted
  above, all receivable balances from the remaining individual customers were
  less than 10% of the Company’s net receivable balance. The Company maintains
  insurance, to the extent available, on the receivable balances, with certain
  limits, in the event of a customer’s bankruptcy or insolvency.


TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Revenue Recognition

Publishing revenue is derived from the sale of
  internally developed interactive software titles or from the sale of titles
  licensed from a third-party developer. Publishing revenue amounted to $568,089,
  $241,838 and $186,118 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Distribution revenue is derived from the sale of
  third-party interactive software titles, hardware and accessories. Distribution
  revenue amounted to $225,887, $206,963 and $177,883 for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
  respectively.

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
  Statement of Position (“SOP”) 97-2 “Software Revenue Recognition”,
  as amended by SOP 98-9 “Modification of SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition
  with respect to Certain Transactions.” SOP 97-2 provides guidance on applying
  generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software
  transactions. SOP 98-9 deals with the determination of vendor specific objective
  evidence of fair value in multiple element arrangements, such as maintenance
  agreements sold in conjunction with software packages. The Company’s transactions
  generally include only one element, the interactive software game. The Company
  recognizes revenue when the price is fixed and determinable, there is persuasive
  evidence of an arrangement, the fulfillment of its obligations under any such
  arrangement and determination that collection is probable. Accordingly, revenue
  is recognized when title and all risks of loss are transferred to the customer,
  which is generally upon receipt. The Company’s payment arrangements with
  its customers provide primarily 60 day terms and to a limited extent with certain
  customers 30 or 90 day terms.

The Company’s distribution arrangements with
  customers generally do not give customers the right to return products; however,
  the Company at its discretion may accept product returns for stock balancing
  or defective products. In addition, the Company sometimes negotiates accommodations
  to customers, including price discounts, credits and product returns, when demand
  for specific products falls below expectations. The Company generally accepts
  returns and grants price protection in connection with its publishing arrangements.
  The Company establishes a reserve for future returns and other allowances based
  primarily on its return policies, price protection and historical return rates.
  The Company may not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and allowances
  for certain customers or it may be unable to determine that collection of the
  receivable is probable. In such circumstances, the Company defers the revenues
  at the time of the sale and recognizes them when collection of the related receivable
  becomes probable or cash is received.

Effective November 1, 2000, the Company adopted
  Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition
  in Financial Statements”. Consistent with the guidelines provided in SAB
  No. 101, the Company changed its revenue recognition policy to recognize revenue
  as noted above. Prior to the adoption of SAB 101, the Company recognized revenue
  upon shipment. As a result of adopting SAB 101, net sales and cost of sales
  of approximately $27.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively, which were originally
  recognized in the year ended October 31, 2000 were also recognized in the year
  ended October 31, 2001. The cumulative effect of the application of the revenue
  recognition policies set forth in SAB 101 for the year ended October 31, 2001
  was approximately $5.3 million net of tax benefit of approximately $3.6 million
  or $0.16 per share. Had the Company adopted SAB 101 as of the beginning of fiscal
  2000, the unaudited pro forma net sales, net income and diluted earnings per
  share for the year ended October 31, 2000 would have been approximately $345
  million, $4.6 million and $0.16, respectively.

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Advertising

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
  The Company shares portions of certain customers’ advertising expenses
  through co-op advertising arrangements. Co-op advertising allowances provided
  to customers are recognized at the time the revenue is recognized. Advertising
  expense for the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 amounted to $39,909,
  $22,983 and $16,769, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments
  purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventory

Inventories are stated at the lower of average
  cost or market. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its
  inventories and makes adjustments as necessary. Reserves for product returns
  are included in the inventory balance.

Prepaid Royalties

The Company’s agreements with licensors and
  developers generally provide it with exclusive publishing rights and require
  it to make advance royalty payments that are recouped against royalties due
  to the developer based on product sales. Prepaid royalties are amortized as
  cost of sales on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion
  of current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for that
  title or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales. The
  Company continually evaluates the recoverability of prepaid royalties and charges
  to cost of sales the amount that management determines is probable that will
  not be recouped at the contractual royalty rate in the period in which such
  determination is made or if the Company determines that it will cancel a development
  project. Included in prepaid royalties at October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively
  are $22,561 and $13,811 related to titles that have not been released yet. Prepaid
  royalties are classified as current and non-current assets based upon estimated
  net product sales within the next year. During the fiscal year 2000, prepaid
  royalties were written down by $501 and the amortization of prepaid royalties
  amounted to $16,849.

The following table provides the details of total
  prepaid royalties:

Capitalized Software Development Costs

The Company capitalizes internal software development
  costs, as well as film production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing
  technological feasibility of a title. Capitalized software development costs
  represent the costs associated with the internal development of the Company’s
  publishing products. Amortization of such costs as a component of cost of sales
  is recorded on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion
  of current year sales to total of current and estimated future sales for the
  title or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of
  the title. The Company continually evaluates the recoverability of capitalized
  software costs and will charge to cost of sales any amounts that are deemed
  unrecoverable or for projects that it will abandon.

The following table provides the details of capitalized
  software development costs:

For the year ended October 31, 2001, capitalized
  software development costs of $389 were written off as cost of sales –
  software development costs, as part of the impairment charge as described in
  Note 3. Amortization of capitalized software development costs amounted to $1,451
  during fiscal year 2000. No capitalized software development costs were written
  down during fiscal year 2000.

Amounts relating to intellectual property rights
  for several products and technologies, which were not developed internally,
  amounting to $2,195 gross carrying amount, have been reclassified to intangible
  assets in all periods presented.

Property and Equipment

Office equipment, furniture and fixtures and automobiles
  are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated lives ranging
  from five to seven years. Computer equipment and software are depreciated using
  the straight-line method over three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
  over the lesser of the term of the related lease or estimated useful lives.
  Accumulated amortization includes the amortization of assets recorded under
  capital leases, which amounted to approximately $92 and $202 at October 31,
  2002 and 2001, respectively. The cost of additions and betterments are capitalized,
  and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations in the periods incurred.
  When depreciable assets are retired or sold, the cost and related allowances
  for depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized.
  The carrying amounts of these assets are recorded at historical cost.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles
  and the remaining excess purchase price paid over identified intangible and
  tangible net assets of acquired companies (goodwill). Effective November 1,
  2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
  No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”) in its entirety
  and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
  Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). SFAS 141 requires all
  business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
  and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination shall
  be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS 142 addresses the recognition
  and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their
  acquisition. SFAS 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives
  be amortized and that intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill not
  be amortized. The Company discontinued the amortization of goodwill as of November
  1, 2001. Identifiable intangibles are amortized under the straight-line method
  over the period of expected benefit ranging from three to ten years, except
  for intellectual property, which is amortized based on the shorter of the useful
  life or expected revenue stream. Prior to November 1, 2001, intangible assets
  were amortized under the straight line method over the period of expected benefit
  of seven years for the acquisition of development studios and ten years for
  the acquisition of distribution operations. Upon completion of the transitional
  impairment test, the fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded the
  reporting unit’s carry amount and no impairment was indicated.

SFAS 142 requires an annual test for impairment
  of goodwill, and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change
  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
  its carrying amount. In assessing potential impairment of goodwill, the Company
  determines the implied fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash
  flow analysis and compares such values to the respective reporting unit’s
  carrying amount. The Company performs its annual test for indication of goodwill
  impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. At October 31, 2002, the
  fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts
  and no impairment was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance
  with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
  “Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long Lived Assets to
  be Disposed Of” (“SFAS 121”). SFAS 121 requires that long-lived
  assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company
  compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future
  cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount
  of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the
  Company records an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying
  amount of the asset and its fair value. The estimation of fair value is generally
  measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the Company’s incremental
  borrowing rate or fair value if available.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its employee stock option
  plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
  for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). Under APB 25, generally
  no compensation expense is recorded when the terms of the award are fixed and
  the exercise price of the employee stock option equals or exceeds the fair value
  of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company adopted the disclosure-only
  provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
  for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).


TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE,
  INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Net Income (Loss) per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed
  by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders for the
  year by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
  year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to
  common stockholders for the year by the weighted-average number of common and
  common stock equivalents, which include common shares issuable upon the exercise
  of stock options and warrants outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents
  are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) represents the change
  in net assets of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
  other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income
  (loss) of the Company includes net income adjusted for the change in foreign
  currency translation adjustments and the change in net unrealized gain (loss)
  from investments.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred taxes under the
  asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
  liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between
  the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently
  enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected
  to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized
  in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In addition, valuation
  allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
  amounts expected to be realized.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for the Company’s
  foreign operations is the applicable local currency. Accounts of foreign operations
  are translated into U.S. dollars using quarter or year-end exchange rates for
  assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and average prevailing exchange
  rates for the period for revenue and expense accounts. Adjustments resulting
  from translation are included in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized
  and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period
  in which they occur.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial
  instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
  payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their short
  maturities. The carrying amount of prepaid royalties and investments approximate
  fair value based upon the recoverability of these assets. The carrying amount
  of the Company’s lines of credit approximates fair value because the interest
  rates of the lines of credit are based on floating rates identified by reference
  to market rates. The carrying amounts of the Company’s loan payable and
  capital lease obligations approximate the fair value of such instruments based
  upon management’s best estimate of interest rates that would be available
  to the Company for similar debt obligations at October 31, 2001.

Consideration Given to Customers or Resellers

In November 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
  Board (“FASB”) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus
  on EITF Issue 01-09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
  or Reseller of the Vendor’s Products, which is a codification of EITF 00-14,
  00-22 and 00-25. This EITF presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer
  or reseller of the vendor’s products to be a reduction of the selling prices
  of the vendor’s products and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction
  of revenue when recognized in the vendor’s income statement and could lead
  to negative revenue under certain circumstances. Revenue reduction is required
  unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit’s
  fair value can be established. The Company has early adopted EITF 01-09 effective
  November 1, 2001. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact
  on the consolidated condensed financial statements. The prior period financial
  statements have been reclassified in accordance with this statement and as a
  result, net sales and selling and marketing expenses have been reduced by $2,255
  for the year ended October 31, 2001, with no impact on reported net loss.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Obligations Associated with
  the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 143”). The objective
  of SFAS 143 is to provide accounting guidance for legal obligations associated
  with the retirement of long-lived assets. The retirement obligations included
  within the scope of this pronouncement are those that an entity cannot avoid
  as a result of either the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a
  long-lived asset. Components of larger systems also fall under this pronouncement,
  as well as tangible long-lived assets with indeterminable lives. The provisions
  of SFAS 143 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
  after June 15, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact
  of the adoption of SFAS 143 on the Company’s financial condition, cash
  flows and results of operations. The Company will adopt the standard in the
  first quarter of fiscal 2003.

In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
  of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”). The objectives of SFAS 144
  are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of Statement
  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment
  of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” (“SFAS
  121”) and to develop a single accounting model, based on the framework
  established in SFAS 121, for the long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale,
  whether previously held and used or newly acquired. The provisions of SFAS 144
  are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
  December 15, 2001. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact of
  the adoption of SFAS 144 on the Company’s financial condition and results
  of operations. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal
  2003.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44
  and 64, Amendment to FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
  (“SFAS 145”). SFAS 145 eliminates the requirement (in SFAS No. 4)
  that gains and losses from the extinguishments of debt be aggregated and classified
  as extraordinary items, net of the related income tax. The rescission of SFAS
  No. 4 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, which for
  the Company would be November 1, 2002. Upon adoption, the $1,948 loss on extinguishment
  of debt that was previously classified as an extraordinary item will be reclassified
  to non-operating expenses. The Company does not expect that the rescission of
  SFAS No. 4 will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition,
  cash flows or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
  or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 requires the recognition
  of such costs when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment
  to an exit or disposal plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are to be applied prospectively
  to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company
  is currently evaluating the expected impact of the adoption of SFAS 146 on the
  Company’s financial condition and results of operations.

4. DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

In July 2001, the Company sold all of the outstanding
  capital stock of Jack of All Games UK, a video game distributor, to Jay Two
  Limited, an unaffiliated third-party controlled by Freightmasters Ltd., for
  approximately $215. In connection with the sale, the purchaser assumed net liabilities
  of $436. The Company recorded a non-operating gain of $651. There were no income
  taxes payable on this gain.

In October 2000, the Company sold all of the outstanding
  shares of Toga to Gameplay and simultaneously entered into a license agreement
  with Gameplay for the online distribution of certain of the Company’s PC
  games. Toga had been purchased in March 2000 (see Note 3). The Company received
  (i) 15,371,698 shares of Gameplay’s common stock (valued at approximately
  $31,100); (ii) a warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Gameplay stock (the
  Company assigned no value to the warrant); and (iii) a joint exploitation agreement
  with Gameplay under which the Company acquired rights to the software development
  business of Neo – a subsidiary of Gameplay (valued at approximately $17,300).
  The value of such right was recorded as prepaid purchase price at the time of
  Toga’s sale and was included in intangible assets at October 31, 2000.

The Company recognized a loss of $286 on the sale
  of Toga, which was recorded as a component of “Gain on sale of subsidiary”
  on the 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations. In January 2001, the Company
  completed the acquisition of Neo and assumed net liabilities of approximately
  $808, in addition to the prepaid purchase price of $17,266 noted above.

In June 2000, the Company sold its 19.9% equity
  interest in Bungie Software (“Bungie”) to Microsoft Corporation for
  approximately $5,000 in cash. The Company did not realize any gain or loss on
  this transaction. Separately, the Company sold its exclusive Halo publishing
  and distribution rights to Bungie for $4,000 in cash, a royalty free license
  to Bungie’s Halo technology in connection with the development of two original
  products and all right, title and interest to the

Myth

franchise and
  the PC and PlayStation(R) 2 game,

Oni

. The Company recorded this transaction
  as net sales of $5,500 after giving effect to the receipt of $9,000 in cash
  and $5,800 of assets (consisting of $2,800 relating to

Oni

, $1,500 relating
  to

Myth

and $1,500 relating to the license to use Halo game engine technology
  for two original products), net of $9,300 of assets sold.

In February 2000, the Company sold all of its interest
  in Falcon Ventures Corporation d/b/a DVDWave.com to eUniverse, Inc. (“eUniverse”)
  in exchange for 310,000 shares of eUniverse’s common stock. The Company
  recognized a gain of $1,976 and recorded such gain as a component of “Gain
  on sale of subsidiary” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company
  discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective November 1, 2001. The only
  addition to goodwill in 2002 was the $5,496 related to the Barking Dog acquisition.
  Identifiable intangible assets are amortized under the straight-line method
  over the period of expected benefit ranging from three to ten years, except
  for intellectual property, which is amortized based on the shorter of the useful
  life or expected revenue stream. The Company re-characterized acquired workforce
  of $925, which is no longer defined as an acquired intangible asset under SFAS
  141, as goodwill. Additionally, the estimated useful lives of certain identifiable
  intangible assets were adjusted in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 142.
  The adjustment to the useful lives did not have a significant effect on the
  results of operations.

Intangible assets consist of trademarks, intellectual
  property, customer lists, acquired technology and the excess purchase price
  paid over identified intangible and tangible net assets of acquired companies
  (goodwill).

In May 2002, the Company acquired all right, title
  and interest to the

Max Payne

product franchise, including all of the
  intellectual property rights associated with the brand, and a perpetual, royalty-free
  license to use the

Max Payne

game engine and related technology. The
  purchase price consisted of $10,000 in cash and 969,932 shares of restricted
  common stock (valued at $18,543). In addition, the Company is contingently liable
  to make aggregate payments of up to $8,000 in cash upon the timely delivery
  of the final version of

Max Payne 2

for the PC and the achievement of
  certain sales targets for such product. On a preliminary basis, the

Max Payne

assets acquired have been recorded as intellectual property and included in
  intangible assets. The additional $8,000 will be recorded as an additional intangible
  asset upon resolution of the contingency.

In December 2000, the Company acquired the exclusive
  worldwide publishing rights to the franchise of Duke Nukem PC and video games.
  In connection with the transaction, the Company paid $2,300 in cash and issued
  557,103 shares of its common stock (valued at approximately $5,400). In addition,
  the Company is contingently liable to make a further payment of $6,000 upon
  delivery of the final version of

Duke Nukem Forever

for the PC. The Company
  recorded an intangible asset of $7,700 related to the intellectual property
  purchased in this transaction. The additional $6,000 will be recorded as an
  additional intangible asset upon resolution of the contingency.

6. INVESTMENTS

Investments are comprised of marketable equity
  securities and are classified as current and non-current assets. The investments
  are accounted for under the cost method as “available-for-sale” in
  accordance with Statement of Financial Standards No. 115 “Accounting for

  stated at fair value, with unrealized appreciation (loss) reported as a separate
  component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’
  equity.

During 2001, the Company recorded an impairment
  charge of $21,477, consisting of approximately $19,171 relating to its investment
  in Gameplay, $2,000 relating to its investment in eUniverse, Inc. based on the
  quoted market prices and $306 relating to its investment in a privately-held
  company, which is included in other non-current assets. All of these investments
  were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. In addition, the Company
  recorded unrealized gains and losses on its remaining investments through other
  comprehensive income (loss).

In December 1999, the Company entered into a credit
  agreement, as amended and restated in August 2002, with a group of lenders led
  by Bank of America, N.A., as agent. The agreement provides for borrowings of
  up to $40,000 through the expiration of the line of credit on August 28, 2005.
  Generally, advances under the line of credit are based on a borrowing formula
  equal to 75% of eligible accounts receivable plus 35% of eligible inventory.
  Interest accrues on such advances at the bank’s prime rate plus 0.25% to
  1.25%, or at LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75% depending on the Company’s consolidated
  leverage ratio (as defined). The Company is required to pay a commitment fee
  to the bank equal to 0.5% of the unused loan balance. Borrowings under the line
  of credit are collateralized by the Company’s accounts receivable, inventory,
  equipment, general intangibles, securities and other personal property, including
  the capital stock of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under
  the agreement are reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit which
  were $5,546 at October 31, 2002. The loan agreement contains certain financial
  and other covenants, including the maintenance of consolidated net worth, consolidated
  leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. As of October 31,
  2002, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. The loan agreement
  limits or prohibits the Company from declaring or paying cash dividends, merging
  or consolidating with another corporation, selling assets (other than in the
  ordinary course of business), creating liens and incurring additional indebtedness.
  The Company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit
  as of October 31, 2002.

In February 2001, the Company’s United Kingdom
  subsidiary entered into a credit facility agreement, as amended in March 2002,
  with Lloyds TSB Bank plc (“Lloyds”) under which Lloyds agreed to make
  available borrowings of up to approximately $20,500. Advances under the credit
  facility bear interest at the rate of 1.25% per annum over the bank’s base
  rate, and are guaranteed by the Company. Borrowings under the agreement are
  reduced by the amount of outstanding guarantees, which were $235 at October
  31, 2002. The facility expires on March 31, 2004. The Company had no outstanding
  borrowings under this facility as of October 31, 2002.

11. EXTRAORDINARY LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT

In July 2000, the Company entered into a subordinated
  loan agreement with Finova Mezzanine Capital Inc. (“Finova”) in the
  principal amount of $15 million. The loan was payable in full in July 2005,
  and bore interest at the rate of 12.5% per annum, payable monthly. In connection
  with the loan, the Company issued to Finova a five year warrant to purchase
  approximately 452,000 shares of common stock exercisable at a price of $11.875
  per share. The warrant was valued at approximately $2.9 million, using the Black-Scholes
  pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: expected volatility
  of 55.0%; a risk-free interest rate of 6.1%; dividend rate of 0.0% and an expected
  term of 5.2 years. Subject to the outstanding loan balance, the warrant entitled
  Finova to receive additional shares of the Company’s Common Stock for three
  consecutive years commencing July 2003, and contained certain anti-dilution
  provisions. The Company had recorded the loan net of a discount of approximately
  $2.9 million to reflect an allocation of the proceeds to the estimated value
  of the warrant. The discount was amortized using the “interest method”
  over the term of the financing.

In July 2001, the Company prepaid the outstanding
  subordinated loan and recorded an extraordinary loss of $1,948, net of $1,217
  of income taxes, related to the deferred financing costs and the unamortized
  discount associated with the loan. In accordance with its terms, the contingent
  warrant for additional shares of the Company’s Common Stock was terminated.

  for the Southern District of New York granted final approval of an agreement
  to settle a consolidated class action lawsuit entitled Gershon Bassman v. Take-Two
  Interactive Software, Inc. for $7,500 in cash. During the year ended October
  31, 2002, the Company recorded $1,468 of class action settlement costs, which
  represents the settlement of $7,500 and related legal fees, net of $6,145 of
  insurance proceeds, which were paid and received during the three months ended
  October 31, 2002.

In July 2002, the Company settled all ordinary
  course of business litigation with Red Storm Entertainment Inc., a subsidiary
  of Ubi Soft Entertainment, including certain claims resulting from a distribution
  agreement. During the year ended October 31, 2002, the Company recorded $3,064
  in cost of sales – product costs and $1,190 in general and administrative
  costs related to this settlement.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued
  a formal order of investigation into, among other things, certain accounting
  matters relating to the Company’s financial statements, periodic reporting
  and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws.

The Company is involved in routine litigation in
  the ordinary course of its business, which in management’s opinion will
  not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
  cash flows or results of operations.

  carryforwards totaling approximately $21,000. The capital loss carryforwards
  expire in fiscal 2006. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of taxable income
  from capital transactions might affect the ultimate realization of the capital
  loss carryforwards. If this were to occur, management is committed to implementing
  tax planning strategies, such as the sale of net appreciated assets of the Company,
  to the extent required (if any) to generate sufficient taxable income prior
  to the expiration of these benefits.

  may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were paid
  as dividends to the Company.

  of Directors or any Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, has the authority
  to determine the individuals to whom the stock options are to be granted, the
  number of shares to be covered by each option, the option price, the type of
  option, the option period, restrictions, if any, on the exercise of the option,
  the terms for the payment of the option price and other terms and conditions.
  As of April 30, 2002, there were no options available for grant under the 1997

The fair value of the Company’s stock options
  used to compute pro forma net income and the net income per share disclosures
  is the estimated present value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
  model. The weighted average fair values of options granted were $9.13, $5.76
  and $5.78 for years ended October 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
  following weighted average assumptions for 2002 were used to value grants: expected
  volatility of 74%; a risk-free interest rate of 1.77 %; and an expected holding
  period of 4.1 years. The following weighted average assumptions for 2001 were
  used to value grants: expected volatility of 85% for grants with a holding period
  of 2 years, 79% for a holding period of 3 years and 75% for holding periods
  of 4 to 5 years; a risk-free interest rate of generally 4.85% to 5.0%; and an
  expected holding period of two to five years. The following weighted average
  assumptions were used to value grants for 2000; expected volatility of 96% for
  grants with a holding period of two years, and expected volatility of 60% for
  grants with a holding period of three to four years and 65% for holding periods
  of five years or more; a risk-free interest rate of generally 5.5% to 6.7%;
  and an expected holding period of two to five years.

19. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company has adopted Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
  and Related Information” (“SFAS No. 131”), which established
  standards for reporting by public business enterprises of information about
  product lines, geographical areas and major customers. The method for determining
  what information to report is based on the way management organizes the Company
  for making operational decisions and assessment of financial performance. The
  Company’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Company’s
  Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CEO reviews financial information
  presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about
  sales by geographic region and by product platforms. The Company’s Board
  of Directors reviews consolidated financial information. The Company’s
  operations employ the same products, cost structures, margins and customers
  worldwide. The Company’s product development, publishing and marketing
  activities are centralized in the United States under one management team, with
  distribution activities managed geographically. Accordingly, the Company’s
  operations fall within one reportable segment as defined in SFAS No. 131.

For the years ended October 31, 2002, 2001, and
  2000, the Company’s net sales in domestic markets accounted for approximately
  79.9%, 76.3% and 71.6% respectively, and net sales in international markets
  accounted for 20.1%, 23.7%, and 28.4%, respectively.

As of October 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company’s
  net property, plant and equipment in domestic markets accounted for approximately
  $11,222 and $7,710, respectively, and net property, plant and equipment in international
  markets accounted for $4,097 and $3,323, respectively.

Information about the Company’s total non-current
  assets in the United States and international areas as of October 31, 2002 and
  2001 are presented below:
