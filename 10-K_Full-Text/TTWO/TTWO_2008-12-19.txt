Item 1.    Business

General

We are a global publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our publishing segment consists of our Rockstar Games, 2K
Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play publishing labels. We develop, market and publish software titles for the leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms including: Sony's
PLAYSTATION®3 ("PS3") and PlayStation®2 ("PS2") computer entertainment systems; Sony's PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) ("PSP") system;
Microsoft's Xbox 360® ("Xbox 360") video game and entertainment system; Nintendo's Wii™ ("Wii") and DS™ ("DS") systems; and for the PC and Games
for Windows®. The installed base for the prior generation of console platforms, including PS2 ("prior generation platforms") is substantial. The release of the PS3, Xbox 360,
and Wii platforms ("current generation platforms") has further expanded the video game software market. We are continuing to increase the number of titles released on the current generation platforms
while also developing titles for certain prior generation platforms such as PS2 and DS given their significant installed base, as long as it is economically
attractive to do so. Our distribution segment, which primarily consists of our Jack of All Games subsidiary, distributes our products as well as software, hardware and accessories produced by others
to retail outlets in North America.

Expanding
gamer demographics have driven demand for interactive entertainment software in recent years, with video games becoming a mainstream entertainment choice for a maturing, sophisticated
audience. According to the Entertainment Software Association, U.S. computer and video game software sales grew six percent in 2007 to $9.5 billion—more than tripling industry
software sales since 1996. At least half of all Americans claim to play PC or video games, with an estimated 65% of heads of households playing games. The average game player is 35 years old
and has been playing for nearly 13 years. The "

Global Entertainment and Media Outlook: 2008-2012

" published by

PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Entertainment and Media
Practice

estimates that the video game industry is expected to grow from $48.3 billion in
global sales in 2008 to $68.3 billion in 2012, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 10.3%. The largest category is console games, which is expected to grow from $27.8 billion
in 2008 to $34.7 billion in 2012, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.9%.

The
video game industry is cyclical and the installed base of hardware platforms has historically had a significant effect on the demand for gaming software. In 2008, we saw demand for prior
generation gaming software diminish as consumers continued to upgrade to the current generation of hardware platforms. In fiscal 2008, we developed and published nine titles for PS3, ten titles for
Xbox 360, nine titles for the Wii,


and
ten titles for PS2. Information concerning the global installed base for prior generation, current generation and handheld platforms for 2004 through 2012 is as follows:

Revenue
in our distribution segment is derived from the sale of third party software titles, accessories and hardware in North America. Operating margins in our distribution business depend in large
part on the mix of software and hardware sales, with software sales generally yielding higher margins than hardware. We have focused on improving margins in our distribution business. In 2008, we sold
certain assets of our distribution segment pertaining to the warehouse management, processing and value-added service operations of our distribution facility to Ditan Distribution LLC
("Ditan"), a logistics management solutions provider. In addition, we agreed to outsource the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions for our publishing and distribution businesses to Ditan. We
believe this will allow Jack of All Games to better focus on purchasing, sales and service for their customers.

Strategy

Overview.

We endeavor to be the most creative, innovative and efficient company in our industry. Our strategy is to
capitalize on the growth of the interactive entertainment market, particularly the expanding demographics of video game players, and focus on creating premium quality games and successful


franchises
for which we can create sequels. We develop most of our frontline products internally and own the intellectual property associated with most of our titles, which we believe best positions
us financially and competitively. We have established a portfolio of proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of genres including action, adventure, racing,
role-playing, sports and strategy. We believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength, allowing us to differentiate many of our products in the
marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling story lines and characters that provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers. We have created, acquired or licensed a group of highly
recognizable brands to match the variety of consumer demographics we aspire to serve, ranging from adults to children and game enthusiasts to casual gamers.

Support Multiple Labels to Target Distinct Market Segments.

We publish our titles under four separate labels:
Rockstar Games, 2K Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play, with each label focused on distinct product genres and target demographics. We expect Rockstar Games, our wholly-owned publisher of the hit

Grand Theft Auto

and

Midnight Club

franchises, to continue to be a leader in the action product category
by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands. We expect 2K Games, developer and publisher of our successful

Sid Meier's
Civilization

series and our critically acclaimed

BioShock

title, to continue to develop new and successful franchises in the
future. Our 2K Sports series, which includes

Major League Baseball 2K

,

NBA 2K

and

NHL 2K,

provides us with
consistent revenue streams because we publish them on an annual basis. We established the 2K Play label to focus on the growing
market of casual and family-oriented games.

Carnival Games

has been a strong performing, internally developed and owned franchise, and 2K Play has
leveraged this brand through sequels and product extensions, including

Carnival Games™ MiniGolf

. We have expansion initiatives in the
rapidly growing Asia Pacific markets, where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products, develop a presence in Japan, and establish an online gaming presence, especially in
China and Korea.

Maximize Product Selection and Development.

Our primary strategy is to publish a select number of high quality
titles based on internally owned and developed intellectual property, which typically provide higher margins than licensed products. We currently have over 15 proprietary brands which we expect to
leverage in the future. In addition, we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties, including sports, and also publish externally developed titles.

We
use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment, to review existing titles in development, and to review titles after their release to assess product
performance. We apply this process to all of our products, whether externally or internally developed. The product investment review process includes in-depth reviews of each project at
various stages of development by our executive management team and senior management of our publishing labels, and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of
the titles. This disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles.

We
develop our products using a combination of our internal and external development resources acting under contract with us. We typically select our external developers based on their track record
and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre. One developer will often produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to an original game. We believe
that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources, which we believe increases the quality
of our products.

Diversify Revenue by Title, Genre, Platform, and Target Demographic.

We believe the diversification of our product
mix will reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue. We expect to increase revenue in our sports business as the installed base of current generation hardware grows and consumers purchase
sports titles for these newer platforms, which generally sell at higher price points than software for prior generation systems. We also plan to develop and market additional titles under our

Major League
Baseball

license and continue to focus on maximizing the quality of all of our sports titles. In addition, we expect to offer a wider
variety of titles for an expanded group of customers through our 2K Play label, which is


focused
on family and casual games. We also offer our titles on the popular hardware platforms to take advantage of their increasing installed base, including the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP and
DS.

Leverage Emerging Technologies.

The technological advances in our industry are leading to new revenue streams which
we are seeking to capitalize on. We see opportunities in a variety of areas, including downloadable content, in-game advertising, micro-transactions and massively multiplayer online gaming
("MMOG"). We released downloadable content for

BioShock

® on the PlayStation®Network, and plan to release downloadable
content for

Grand Theft Auto IV

on Xbox Live®, Microsoft's online entertainment and gaming network, in fiscal 2009. We currently include
advertising in many of our sports titles. We also plan to pursue opportunities that exist for networked gameplay, particularly for our wholly-owned franchises, as well as micro-transactions, where
gamers can pay to download additional content to enhance their game playing experience.

Expand International Business.

The global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow, and we seek to
increase our presence internationally, particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin
America. In 2008, we purchased 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion Softworks, a Czech Republic developer of the

Mafia

video game franchise. We also
have expansion initiatives in the rapidly growing Asia Pacific markets, where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products, develop a presence in Japan, and establish an online
gaming presence, especially in China and Korea. Historically, we typically distributed our products in Asia through license and royalty agreements with local publishers. While we retain title to all
intellectual property, local publishers are responsible for localization of software content, distribution and marketing of the products in their respective local markets. We intend to build upon
these relationships and also establish new relationships to expand our international business.

Our Publishing and Software Development Businesses

Revenue in our publishing segment is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed on our behalf by third parties.
Operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new, commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs. We
have internal development studios located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Australia and China. As of October 31, 2008, we had a research and development staff
of approximately 1,500 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major current and prior generation consoles, handheld hardware platforms and PCs in multiple
languages and territories.

Operating
margins associated with our externally developed titles, or titles for which we do not own the intellectual property, are generally lower because they require us to acquire licenses, provide
minimum development guarantees, and pay third party royalties. Agreements with third party developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make advance royalty
payments, pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions. Royalty advances for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on
software sales. Our agreements with third party developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making advance payments if specified development milestones
are not satisfied. We also regularly monitor the level of advances in light of expected sales for the related titles.

The
development cycle for our titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months. Although we often simultaneously develop our software for multiple platforms, in certain cases it can take
9 to 12 months to adapt a product for additional hardware platforms after initial development for one platform is completed. The cost to develop a frontline software product generally ranges
from $10 million to $30 million. We expect that development costs and time will continue to increase for current generation platforms.

We
continue to explore new revenue streams as they evolve, including higher margin sources such as downloadable content and in-game advertising. In the third quarter of 2008, we announced
plans to


leverage
our wholly-owned intellectual property,

BioShock,

by allowing Universal Pictures to develop it into a feature film.

Rockstar Games.

Software titles published by our Rockstar Games label are primarily internally developed. Rockstar
Games is the publisher of our blockbuster

Grand Theft Auto

franchise and is focused on creating premium content and groundbreaking entertainment. We
believe that Rockstar has established a uniquely original, popular cultural phenomenon with its

Grand Theft Auto

series and we have taken advantage of
its success by developing new proprietary brands as well as sequels to our existing franchises. Our latest iteration in the

Grand Theft Auto

series,

Grand Theft Auto
IV

, was released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. For the years ended October 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, our

Grand Theft Auto

titles accounted for 46.2%, 13.1% and 22.4% of our total net revenue, respectively. No other products
accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended October 31, 2008. Rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres, including the

Bully

,

Manhunt

,

Max Payne

,

Midnight Club

, and

Red Dead Revolver

franchises.

In
addition, Rockstar and Microsoft announced an agreement whereby Rockstar will publish additional downloadable content for

Grand Theft Auto IV

exclusively on Xbox Live. The digitally delivered content will be available for purchase by Xbox Live subscribers, allowing them to expand their

Grand Theft Auto
IV

gameplay experience. We expect downloadable content to become more prevalent as broadband connectivity continues to gain popularity and digital delivery platforms such as
Xbox Live, PlayStation Network and Valve's Steam gain additional customers.

2K Games.

2K Games has published a variety of popular entertainment properties across multiple genres and
platforms. 2K Games' internally owned and developed franchises include the critically acclaimed, multi-million unit selling

BioShock

,

Mafia

, and

Sid Meier's Civilization

series. Externally developed titles have included

The Darkness

™,

The Elder Scrolls IV®:
Oblivion

™ and

Fantastic Four

™

: Rise of the Silver Surfer.

2K Sports.

We develop most of our 2K Sports software titles through our internal development studios including the

Major League Baseball
2K

series,

NBA 2K

series,

NHL 2K

series, and our

Top Spin

tennis series. Since its formation, our 2K Sports label has secured major sports league licenses including
long-term, third party exclusive licensing relationships with Major League Baseball Properties, the Major League Baseball Players Association and Major League Baseball Advanced Media.

2K Play.

Our 2K Play label focuses on developing and publishing titles for the growing market of casual and
family-friendly games. While the majority of our 2K Play titles are developed by third party developers, we have also developed titles for our 2K Play label internally, including

Carnival Games

and the

Deal or No Deal

series. 2K Play also has a partnership with Nickelodeon to
publish video games based on its' top rated Nick Jr. titles such as

Dora the Explorer

and

Go, Diego, Go!

We expect family-oriented gaming to be an important component of our industry in the future.

Our Distribution Business

Our distribution segment, which is primarily comprised of our Jack of All Games subsidiary, distributes our products and derives its revenue from the sale of third party
software, hardware and accessories to retail outlets primarily in North America. Operating margins in our distribution business are largely dependent on the mix of software and hardware sales with
software sales generally yielding higher margins than hardware sales.

In
September 2008, we sold certain assets of our distribution segment, pertaining to warehouse management, processing and shipping operations, to Ditan, a logistics management solutions provider. As
part of the transaction, Ditan assumed our warehouse lease and personnel. In addition, we agreed to outsource the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions for our publishing and distribution
businesses to


Ditan.
We believe this will allow Jack of All Games to better focus on purchasing, sales and service for their customers.

Jack
of All Games has established a strong presence in the budget segment of the gaming software distribution business due to its expanding portfolio of value-priced products and its expertise in
selling such titles.

Intellectual Property

Our business is highly dependent on the creation, acquisition, licensing and protection of intellectual property. Some of the intellectual property rights we have created or
acquired for our portfolio of brands are:

BioShock, Bully, Carnival Games, Grand Theft Auto, Mafia, Manhunt, Max Payne, Midnight Club, Railroad Tycoon

,

Red Dead Revolver, Rockstar
Games Presents Table Tennis, Sid Meier's Civilization, Sid Meier's Pirates!, Sid Meier's Railroads!, Smuggler's Run, Spec Ops, The BIGS, The
Darkness,

and

Top Spin.

We believe that content ownership facilitates our internal product development efforts and
maximizes profit potential. We attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure,
copying and distribution. Although we generally do not hold any patents, we obtain trademark and copyright registrations for many of our products.

We
also enter into content license agreements, such as those with sports leagues and players associations, movie studios and performing talent, music labels and musicians. These licenses are typically
limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods. In addition, we license and include console manufacturer technology in our products on a non-exclusive basis,
which allows our games to be played on their respective hardware systems.

Arrangements with Platform Manufacturers

We have entered into license agreements with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to develop and publish software in North America, Europe and Australia. We are not required to obtain
any licenses from hardware manufacturers to develop titles for the PC.

Sony.

Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. grants us the right and license to develop, market, publish and
distribute software titles for the PS3, PS2 and PSP. We are required to submit products to Sony for approval and to make royalty payments to Sony based on the number of units manufactured. In
addition, products for the PS3, PS2 and PSP are required to be manufactured by Sony approved manufacturers.

Microsoft.

Under the terms of the license agreements that we have entered into with Microsoft Corporation and its
affiliates, Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the Xbox 360 and Xbox. The agreements require us to submit products to
Microsoft for approval and for us to make royalty payments to Microsoft based on the number of units manufactured. In addition, products for the Xbox 360 and Xbox are required to be
manufactured by Microsoft approved manufacturers.

Nintendo.

Under the terms of the license agreements that we have entered into with Nintendo Co., Ltd.
and its affiliates, Nintendo granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software for Nintendo's Wii, GameCube, DS and GBA. The agreements require us to submit products
to Nintendo for approval and for us to make royalty payments to Nintendo based on the number of units manufactured. In addition, products for such platforms are required to be manufactured by Nintendo
approved manufacturers.


Manufacturing

Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft either manufacture or control selection of approved manufacturers of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms. We
place a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with Sony, Nintendo or Microsoft and then send software code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer, together with related
artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs for approval, defect testing and manufacture. Games are generally shipped within two to three weeks of receipt of our
purchase order and all materials.

Production
of PC software is performed by third party vendors in accordance with our specifications and includes CD-ROM pressing, assembly of components, printing of packaging and user
manuals and shipping of finished goods. We send software code and a prototype of a title, together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs to the
manufacturers. Games are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order.

We
occasionally experience difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our titles; however such delays have not significantly harmed our business to date. We have not experienced material delays due
to manufacturing defects. Our software titles typically carry a 90-day limited warranty.

Sales

We sell software titles to retail outlets in North America and Europe through direct relationships with large retail customers and third party distributors. Our customers in
North America include leading mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart; specialty retailers such as GameStop; video stores such as Blockbuster; electronics stores such as Best Buy; toy stores
such as Toys "R" Us; national and regional drug stores; and supermarket and discount store chains. Our European customers include Media Markt, Game Stores, and GEM Distribution. We have sales
operations in the Asia Pacific region, Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

We
are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales. Sales to our five largest customers in fiscal 2008 accounted for approximately 40.2% of our net
revenue, with GameStop accounting for 13.1%. No other customer accounted for more than 10.0% of our net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2008.

Marketing

Our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and broaden distribution of our titles, promote brand name recognition, assist retailers and properly
position, package and merchandise our titles.

We
market titles by:

•

Implementing
public relations campaigns, using print and online advertising, television, radio spots and outdoor advertising. We believe that we label and market our
products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, or the ESRB, an independent self-regulatory body that assigns ratings and
enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry.

•

Actively
pursuing relationships with participants in the music and entertainment industries. We believe that the shared demographics between various media and some of the
software titles marketed by our publishing labels provide excellent cross-promotional opportunities. We continue to work with popular recording artists to create sophisticated game soundtracks, enter
into agreements to license high-profile names and likenesses, and make arrangements for co-branding opportunities.


•

Satisfying
certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for Sony's Greatest Hits Programs and Microsoft's
Platinum Hits Program. In connection with these programs, we receive manufacturing discounts from Sony and Microsoft. Similarly, Nintendo has also established a Player's Choice Program for the Wii.

•

Stimulating
continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product. Price concessions may occur at any
time in a product's life cycle, but typically occur three to nine months after a product's initial launch. In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, price concessions to retailers amounted to
$52.3 million, $68.1 million and $73.9 million, respectively. In certain international markets, we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales.

We
also employ various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness, including in-store promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail,
co-operative advertising, as well as attendance at trade shows. We employ separate sales forces for our publishing and distribution operations. As of October 31, 2008, we had a
sales and marketing staff of approximately 250 people.

Our
products generally sell at retail prices ranging from $19.99 to $59.99 in North America. Products that are designated Sony's Greatest Hits (for PS3, PS2 and PSP) and Microsoft's Platinum Hits (for
Xbox 360) generally sell at prices ranging from $19.99 to $29.99.

Distribution

We distribute our own titles as well as software, hardware and accessories developed by others in North America through our Jack of All Games subsidiary. The products we
distribute consist principally of newly released and popular software titles, budget and catalog software titles, and hardware for third party console, handheld and PC products. Our Jack of All Games,
Ohio-based subsidiary outsources the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions and maintains a sales office, while our Jack of All Games, Ontario, Canada-based subsidiary maintains a
warehouse facility and a sales office. We generally ship products by common carrier. Backlog is not material to our business as we generally ship products within seven days after receipt of orders.

We
procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand, as well as pre-orders from retailers. We periodically enter into
agreements with our suppliers that provide exclusive distribution rights to certain products. We carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders.
We utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments.

Competition

In our publishing business, we compete with:

•

Companies
that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large companies with greater financial, marketing and technical personnel and
other resources
than ours, such as Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Midway Games and THQ and international companies, such as Capcom, Eidos, Konami, Namco-Bandai, SEGA and Ubisoft.

•

Sony,
Microsoft and Nintendo for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software, each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for
its own platforms. Each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns.

•

Other
software, hardware, entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources. The competition is intense among an increasing number of newly
introduced


entertainment
software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

•

Other
forms of entertainment such as motion pictures, television and audio, online computer programs and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide
other advantages to consumers.

Competition
in the entertainment software industry is based on: product quality, features, innovation and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility with popular platforms; access to
distribution channels; price; marketing; and customer service. Our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing. Competition for our titles is
influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sell-through of our
titles at retail stores.

In
our distribution business, we compete with large national companies as well as smaller regional distributors. We also compete with the efforts of the major entertainment software companies that
distribute directly to retailers or over the Internet. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do and are able to carry larger inventories,
adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more comprehensive product selection than we can.

International Operations

Sales in international markets, principally in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. For fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006, approximately 40.7%, 31.3% and 39.4%, respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased
credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a
significant impact on our operating results. See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment and Geographic Information

See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our reportable segments.

Employees

As of October 31, 2008, we had approximately 2,100 full-time employees, of which approximately 1,050 were employed outside of the United States. None of our
employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.


Item 1A.    Risk Factors

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as
other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and
financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline.

We depend on our key management and product development personnel.

Our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with ZelnickMedia. In 2008, we amended our existing management
agreement with ZelnickMedia whereby it has agreed to provide executive management services to us and our Board through October 31, 2012. We entered into this amendment in order to secure
management resources which we believe will allow us to grow our business and take advantage of opportunities in the interactive entertainment marketplace. Our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and an Executive Vice President are partners of ZelnickMedia. We are also highly dependent on the expertise, skills and knowledge of certain of our Rockstar employees responsible for content
creation and development of our

Grand Theft Auto

titles and titles based on other brands. Although we entered into new long-term employment agreements
with members of the creative team of our Rockstar Games publishing label, we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels, or at all.

The
loss of the services of our executive officers, ZelnickMedia or our key Rockstar employees could significantly harm our business. In addition, if one or more key employees join a competitor or
form a competing company, we may lose additional personnel, experience material interruptions in product development, delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships
with licensors, suppliers and customers, which could significantly harm our business. Failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect
our business and prospects.

We are dependent on the future success of our Grand Theft Auto products and we must continue to publish "hit" titles or sequels to such "hit" titles in
order to compete successfully in our industry.

Grand Theft Auto

and certain of our other titles are "hit" products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of
our revenue. If we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful "hit" titles or sequels to such "hit" titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following
the commercial release of our "hit" titles or their sequels, our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses. For the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our

Grand Theft
Auto

titles accounted for 46.2%, 13.1% and 22.4% of our net revenue, respectively, and our 10 best selling titles accounted for
approximately 64.2%, 26.6% and 38.4% of our net revenue, respectively. In addition, competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of
total revenue in our industry. Hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate, which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall
below our expectations. If our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value (such as
pay-for-play or subscription-based models), or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and well-received products and services, our revenue and
profitability may decline.

We may not fully realize the anticipated benefits resulting from the recently completed reorganization of our executive management team and our
business.

During the second quarter of 2007, five new members and one incumbent director were elected to our Board at our annual meeting. Our Board then elected a new Chairman and a new
Chief Executive Officer, and also appointed one additional incumbent member and one additional new member to our Board, for a


total
of eight board members. During that quarter we also engaged ZelnickMedia, a media investment and management firm, to provide us with executive management services. The Board and ZelnickMedia
initiated a reorganization of our executive management team and our business in fiscal 2007. While we substantially completed the reorganization in the past fiscal year, it is not yet possible to
assess completely how effective our new management team will be, whether it will be able to accomplish the objectives of our new business development plan or whether our business reorganization plan
will be of significant benefit to us and our financial performance. In addition, the success of our business plan depends in part on events and circumstances that are beyond our control, including
general economic conditions, consumer demand for our products and other factors affecting our industry.

Our business is highly dependent on the continued growth of current generation video game platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful
products for these platforms.

We derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony's PLAYSTATION 3, PlayStation 2 and PSP,
Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii and DS. The success of our business is dependent upon the continued growth of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products
for these platforms.

If the average price of our prior generation software titles continues to decline or if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on current generation
titles, our operating results may suffer.

The interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards.
Consumer demand for software for prior generation platforms has declined as newer and more advanced hardware platforms achieve market acceptance. As the gaming software industry continues to
transition to current generation platforms, we expect prior generation titles will not be able to command premium prices and we expect that these titles will be subject to price reductions earlier in
their product life cycles than we experienced in prior years. As a result, we have reduced prices for our prior generation software titles and we expect to continue to reduce prices for such software
titles, which will have a negative impact on our operating results. These changes may cause the value of our inventory to decline substantially or to become obsolete.

Current
generation titles for the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such consoles. We expect to continue to price current generation titles
at a premium level. However, circumstances may arise in which we may need to reduce prices for such titles. For example, the recent economic turmoil may reduce consumer demand and require us to reduce
prices on our current generation titles. If we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these current generation titles, it will have a material adverse effect on our margins, profitability and results
of operations.

The market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles. The inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance, delays
in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

The market for video games is characterized by short product lives and frequent introductions of new products. New products may not achieve significant market acceptance,
generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development, manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products. The life cycle of a title generally
involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally
constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could
have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations.


Our distribution business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis.

Our ability to obtain particular products in required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is important to the success of our distribution business. In
most cases, we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with suppliers. Our distribution business has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant supply shortages from time to
time due to the inability of certain manufacturers to supply products, such as the newest generation of platforms, on a timely basis. Further, manufacturers or publishers that currently distribute
their products through us may decide to distribute, or to substantially increase their existing distribution, through other distributors, or directly to retailers. If we cannot obtain sufficient
supplies of the products that we distribute, our net revenue could decline and we could incur losses.

We rely on a primary distribution service provider for a significant portion of our products and the failure of this service provider to perform as
expected could materially harm our results of operations.

In September 2008, we entered into a distribution services agreement with Ditan Distribution LLC, under which Ditan assumed responsibility for the shipping, receiving,
warehouse management and related functions for our United States publishing and distribution businesses. We sell our products to our customers in the United States primarily through this distribution
services agreement with Ditan. Our future performance will depend, in part, on Ditan's ability to successfully distribute our products.
If Ditan does not perform adequately, or if we lose Ditan as our distributor and are unable to obtain a satisfactory replacement in a timely manner, our sales and results of operations could suffer.

We may need to raise additional capital if we incur losses.

Although we achieved profitability for the year ended October 31, 2008, we have incurred significant losses in the past. If we incur losses in the future, we may be
required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations. We could seek to raise capital in a number of ways, including through the issuance of debt or equity, or through other financing
arrangements. During the year ended October 31, 2007, we entered into a senior secured line of credit agreement (and expanded the line of credit in November 2007), which requires us to make
periodic interest or other debt service payments. If we borrow additional funds, further debt service payments would probably be necessary. In addition, the terms of additional debt may impose
significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business. If we seek financing through the sale of equity securities, our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership
of common stock. We cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available, particularly in light of the recent economic turmoil
which has, among other consequences, led to the depression of stock prices and the tightening of credit. If we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so, we will have to consider other
options that may include, but are not limited to, a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development, reductions in overhead expenses, and sales of intellectual property
and other assets. These actions, should they become necessary, will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business.

Our ability to raise additional capital may be limited.

Recent disruptions in financial markets have resulted in a severe tightening of credit availability in the United States. Liquidity in credit markets has contracted
significantly, making terms for certain financings less attractive. Ongoing turmoil in the credit markets may make it difficult for us to obtain financing, on acceptable terms or at all, for working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments. These difficulties could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.

Our
credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, paying dividends, repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses. In
addition, we have


granted
a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts. Accordingly, we may be restricted from
taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Our credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial and
non-financial covenants. A breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and allow our lenders to pursue various
remedies, including accelerating the repayment of any indebtedness outstanding under the agreement.

Our involvement, and the involvement of some of our former executive officers in a wide variety of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings has had, and
may in the future have, a material adverse effect on us.

We and some of our former officers, directors and employees have been, and are subject to, a wide variety of lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including the following:

Former Officers.

Our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pled guilty to two felony counts relating to our historical stock option
granting practices and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") instituted a civil action against him. In addition, certain other former officers have been convicted of crimes relating to their
conduct during their employment with us.

Stock Option Granting Practices.

In 2006, a Special Committee of our Board of Directors conducted an investigation into our historical
stock option granting practices. The Special Committee determined that there were improprieties in the process of granting and documenting stock options and that incorrect measurement dates for some
stock option grants had been used for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with respect to
some of our stock-based awards and restated certain previously filed financial information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.
Several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in state and federal courts against some of our current and former directors and some of our former executive officers
relating to our historical stock option granting practices.

FTC Consent Order.

We have entered into an agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission that contains a consent order requiring
us to maintain a comprehensive system reasonably designed to ensure that all content in our electronic games is considered and reviewed in preparing submissions to a U.S. rating agency. We have also
agreed to represent accurately the rating and content descriptors for
games we publish and to disclose to consumers the presence of any content relevant to the rating that was not disclosed to the rating authority.

Personal Injury Actions.

We are named as a defendant in a personal injury and wrongful death action.

SEC Investigation.

We have received a notice from the SEC that it is conducting a formal investigation into our historical stock option
granting practices. We have also received a "Wells" notice informing us of the SEC's intention to file charges against us and seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with this investigation.

IRS Request for Information.

We have received requests for information from the Internal Revenue Service relating to the granting and
exercise of certain stock options and tax deductions taken by us with respect thereto.

Electronic Arts Inc.'s Tender Offer.

Stockholder lawsuits have been filed against us in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and New York state court contending that our directors breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allegedly refusing to explore premium offers by Electronic Arts Inc.
("EA") to acquire all of the Company's shares, enacting a bylaw amendment allegedly designed to entrench the current board by preventing stockholders from nominating and electing alternative
directors, agreeing to an amendment to a management agreement with ZelnickMedia, issuing a proxy statement for the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders that allegedly contained misleading and
incomplete information


and
adopting a "poison pill". Other lawsuits may continue to be filed against us and our directors with similar or additional allegations relating to our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders and the
proxy materials filed with the SEC and mailed to stockholders in connection therewith, the amendment to the ZelnickMedia management agreement, EA's unsolicited tender offer and/or its expiration, our
adoption of a "poison pill," or our review of strategic alternatives.

Other Inquiries and Proceedings.

We have received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York and from
certain state attorneys general relating to some of our products, our historical stock option granting practices, the termination of our former auditors and other matters.

The
investigations and charges against us or other current or former officers, directors or employees have imposed, and are likely to continue to impose, significant costs on us financially. While we
are unable to estimate the exact nature or amount of these future costs, we believe they will likely include:

•

damage
to our reputation and business relationships;

•

professional
fees in connection with the conduct of the investigations and the defense of related litigations and other proceedings;

•

potential
damages, fines, penalties or settlement costs imposed on us;

•

advancement
of certain expenses and reimbursement of certain amounts payable by, or on behalf of, our current and former officers, directors and employees subject to the
investigation or named in any litigations or other proceedings pursuant to our indemnification obligations;

•

potential
impairment of our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement under existing insurance policies, and a potentially negative impact on our future insurance
coverage; and

•

potential
impairment in our ability to raise capital.

Even
if resolved favorably, such litigation or investigations could continue to be time consuming and could continue to result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management team, any of
which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, there can be no assurance as to the reaction of our employees, stockholders,
publishers, developers, customers, distributors, licensors and other business partners to the institution or ultimate resolution of any such proceedings.

If we acquire or invest in other businesses, intellectual properties or other assets, we may be unable to integrate them with our business, our
financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions.

If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may acquire or make investments in businesses, intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic. We
may not be able to identify, negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully. Even if we do succeed in
acquiring or investing in a business, intellectual property or other asset, such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks, including:

•

retaining
key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire;

•

cultural
challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization;

•

the
possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits, including any anticipated operating and product synergies, of the acquisition as quickly
as anticipated or that the costs of, or operational difficulties arising from, an acquisition would be greater than anticipated;


•

significant
acquisition-related accounting adjustments, particularly relating to an acquired company's deferred revenue, that may cause reported revenue and profits of the
combined company to be lower than the sum of their stand-alone revenue and profits;

•

significant
accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures, including potential impairment
charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition;

•

the
possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse impact on the value of the businesses we acquire, including
the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business;

•

the
need to integrate an acquired company's accounting, management information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely
reporting, and the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that, prior to the acquisition, lacked these controls,
procedures and policies;

•

litigation
or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of, an acquisition, including claims from terminated employees,
customers or other third parties; and

•

to
the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the United States, we face additional risks, including risks related to integration of operations across
different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.

Future
acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equity-linked securities (potentially diluting our existing stockholders), the incurrence of debt, contingent
liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or acquired in-process technology, or other increased cash and non-cash expenses such as
stock-based compensation. Any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have
otherwise been achieved by us on a stand-alone basis. Our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review, vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments.

Our ability to acquire licenses to intellectual property, especially for sports titles, impacts our revenue and profitability. Competition for these
licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs.

Many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. For example, our 2K Sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues
and players' associations. Similarly, some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products. Competition for these licenses is intense. If we are unable to maintain these
licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value, our revenue and profitability could decline significantly. Competition for these licenses may
also increase the advances, guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor, which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, on certain
intellectual property licenses, we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments, royalties or standards of performance. If such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum
guarantees, our profitability will be adversely impacted.

Our business is dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties.

Our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis. We rely on third party software developers for the development of some of
our titles. Quality third party developers are continually in high demand. Software developers who have developed titles for us in the


past
may not be available to develop software for us in the future. Due to the limited number of third party software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them, these developers
may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards, if at all. We have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and
distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles. These agreements typically require us to make advance payments, pay royalties and
satisfy other conditions. Our advance payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully, which could result in material delays and significantly increase our
costs to bring particular products to market. Software development costs, promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and third party licensors have increased
significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software. Future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers and
licensors, and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with third party
developers and licensors, the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us, and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results.

We are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs, and we must adapt to changes in software technologies.

We depend on third party software developers and our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and
cost projections. The development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months. Development times and costs of current generation software have increased substantially
as a result of the additional and enhanced features available in the newest games. After development of a product, it may take between 9 to 12 additional months to develop the product for other
hardware platforms. If developers experience financial difficulties, additional costs or unanticipated development delays, we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at
budgeted costs. Certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon game release dates. There can be no assurance that
the products so developed will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products.

Additionally,
in order to stay competitive, our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development. Any inability to respond to
technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable.

The interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive both for our publishing and distribution operations.

We compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which is a large developer and marketer
of software for its own platforms. We also compete with domestic game publishers, such as Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard, THQ and Midway Games and international publishers, such as Capcom,
Eidos, Konami, Namco-Bandai, SEGA and Ubisoft. As our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing, the availability of
significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other
resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties. Our titles also
compete with other forms of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products featuring similar themes, online computer programs and other entertainment, which may be
less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

Our
distribution business also operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is based primarily on breadth, availability and quality of product lines; price; terms and conditions of sale;
credit terms and availability; speed and accuracy of delivery; and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs.


Our
competitors include regional, national and international distributors, as well as hardware manufacturers and software publishers. We may lose market share or be forced in the future to reduce our
prices in response to our competitors. Our distribution business has been adversely affected by lower sales volume of software titles, the availability of certain hardware products, a decrease in
average selling prices of interactive entertainment products as our industry transitions to current generation technology and increased competition in the value software market.

A
number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet. If technological advances
significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially, it could result in a decline in our platform-based software sales and
negatively impact sales of our products.

Increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur
greater expenses to market our titles.

Retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of
shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our
titles. Competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able, or we may have to pay more than our
competitors, to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space.

A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business.

A substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers. Sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 40.2%, 51.1% and 49.4% of
our net revenue for the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, with GameStop accounting for 13.1% of net revenue for the year ended October 31, 2008. Our sales are
made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long-term agreements or other commitments, and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time. Certain of our
customers may decline to carry products containing mature content. The loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers, including as a result of a
product being rated "AO" (age 18 and over), could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy, become insolvent or be
liquidated due to the recent turmoil in the economy, the global contraction of credit or for other factors. Bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our
business, including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers.

Returns of our products by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers. Our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the
right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers, which
include credits and returns, when demand for specific products falls below expectations. We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is
recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions. While we believe that we can reliably estimate
future returns and price concessions, if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves, our revenue could decline.


We submit our products for rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board ("ESRB") in the United States and other voluntary or government ratings
organizations in foreign countries. Failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively impact our ability to distribute and sell those games, as could the
re-rating of a game for any reason.

We voluntarily submit our game products to the ESRB, a U.S.-based non-profit and independent ratings organization. The ESRB system provides consumers with
information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors, such as graphic violence, profanity or sexually explicit
material. The ESRB may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games, including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to
$1 million. Other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. We believe that we comply with rating system requirements and
properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions. In some instances, we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating, which could delay or
disrupt the release of our products. In addition, some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries, such as Germany. In the United States, we develop software
titles that we intend to receive ESRB ratings of "E" (age 6 and older), "E10+" (age 10 and older), "T" (age 13 and older) or "M" (age 17 and older). In addition to these ratings, the ESRB may also
rate a game as "AO" (age 18 and older). Platform licensors may not certify a game rated "AO" and retailers may refuse to sell "AO" games or games with controversial content. For instance, in 2007,
some retailers reacted to the controversy over

Manhunt 2

by refusing to sell it or refusing to sell it in brick and mortar stores. In addition, some
consumers have reacted to re-ratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased, and refraining from
buying other games published by us.

We
have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the ESRB and other ratings organizations. Nonetheless, these processes are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding and
reasonable resource constraints. If a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content, the ESRB could re-rate a game, retailers could refuse to sell it and
demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers, and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money. This could have a material negative impact
on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be exposed to litigation, administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed, which could impact sales of other
video games we sell. If any of these consequences were to occur, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed.

Many
of our Rockstar titles and certain of our 2K Games titles have been rated "M" by the ESRB. If we are unable to obtain "M" ratings and instead receive "AO" ratings on future versions of those or
similar titles as a result of changes in the ESRB's ratings standards or for other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected.
If any of our games are re-rated by the ESRB or other foreign based ratings organizations, we could be exposed to litigation, administrative fines and penalties and other potential
liabilities, and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly impacted.

Our business and products are subject to potential legislation. The adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our
products.

Several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry. Such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of "M" rated, "AO" rated and "Rating Pending"
products to under-17 audiences (while the ESRB rating recommends an appropriate age group, there is currently no legal prohibition on any game sales). If any such proposals are enacted
into law, it may limit the potential market for our "M" rated products in the United States, and adversely affect our operating results. Other countries, such as Germany, have adopted laws regulating
content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current United States laws. In the United States, proposals have also been


made
by numerous state legislators to regulate the sale of "M" or "AO" rated products and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violence or
sexual materials to under 17 or 18 audiences. While such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups, the adoption into law of such legislation in federal and/or in state
jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for our "M" rated titles.

Content policies adopted by retailers, consumer opposition and litigation could negatively impact sales of our products.

Retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem
inappropriate for their businesses. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other
generally objectionable content, or if any of our previously "M" rated series products are rated "AO," we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series, which in
the case of our best selling

Grand Theft Auto

titles could seriously affect our business. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive
entertainment software containing objectionable themes, violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations
and media campaigns. Additionally, although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have been unsuccessful in the courts, claims of this
kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future. See "Item 3.—Legal Proceedings."

We cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors.

We are required to obtain licenses from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, which are also our competitors, to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms. Our
existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title-by-title basis. As a result, the number of titles we are able to publish
for these hardware platforms, our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and, accordingly, our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms, may be limited. If a licensor
chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term, or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles, we may
be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensor's platform. Termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects.

Certain
platform licensors have retained the right to change fee structures for online gameplay, and each licensor's ability to set royalty rates makes it difficult for us to forecast our costs.
Increased costs could negatively impact our operating margins. We may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all.
Failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business.

Our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of "hit" titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to
fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.

We have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results. The release of a "hit" title typically leads to a high level of sales
during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. In addition, the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales typically higher during the
fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters), due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday buying season. Demand for and sales of our sports titles are also
seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict. Our failure or inability to produce "hit" titles or introduce products on a timely basis to
meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results. The uncertainties associated with software development, manufacturing lead times, production delays and
the


approval
process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet
financial expectations.

If we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software, the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our
competitive position could be harmed.

We develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our software and production
techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized
copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy
operations have also proliferated in recent years, resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into
our software, piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability.

Data breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our revenues.

We securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created. A breach, whether physical, electronic or otherwise, of the systems on
which such source code and other sensitive data is stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software. If we are subject to data security breaches, we may have a loss in sales or increased costs
arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.

If we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be adversely affected.

With advances in technology, game content and software graphics are expected to continue to become more realistic. As a result, we believe that interactive entertainment
software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are
named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third party developers
and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur.
Any claims of infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend. Moreover, intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the
distribution of products, obtain a license or redesign our products, which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays.

Our software is susceptible to errors, which can harm our financial results and reputation.

The technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products. As software products become more complex, the risk of
undetected errors in new products increases. We may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors, which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new
products. If, despite testing, errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made, we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance, product returns, loss of
revenue, increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation.


Gross margins relating to our distribution business have historically been narrow, which increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating
results.

As a result of intense price competition, our gross margins in our distribution business have historically been narrow and may continue to be narrow in the future. Accordingly,
slight variations in operating costs and expenses could result in losses in our distribution business from period to period.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is attributable to expenses for personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in
revenue, we may not be able to dispose of facilities, reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit
costs. Management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit. Moreover, reducing costs may impair our ability to
produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade, including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar.

Sales in international markets, primarily in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. We have also recently expanded our Asian operations in an
effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base. Sales in international markets accounted for approximately 40.7%, 31.3% and 39.4%, respectively, of our net revenue for the
years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates, shipping delays, and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results. All of our
international sales are made in local currencies, which could fluctuate against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk,
our results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.

Our business may be affected by issues in the economy that affect consumer spending.

Most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. We believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the
availability of discretionary income. This makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. Certain economic conditions such as U.S. or international
general economic downturns, including periods of increased inflation, unemployment levels, tax rates, interest rates, gasoline and other energy prices or declining consumer confidence could reduce
consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses. A reduction or shift in domestic or
international consumer spending could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases, including
purchases of products like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. If economic conditions worsen, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.

The market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations may be due to factors
specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors under this Item 1A as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material, to changes in
securities analysts' earnings estimates or ratings, to our results or future


financial
guidance falling below our expectations and analysts' and investors' expectations, to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment, media or electronics industries, or to national
or international economic conditions.

Stock
markets, in general, have experienced over the years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that
may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our
operating performance.

We face risks from our international operations.

We are subject to certain risks because of our international operations, particularly as we seek to grow our business and presence outside of the United States. Changes to and
compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic
sales. Trade legislation in either the United States or other countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, import/export compliance laws or other trade laws or policies, could
adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to
legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly
in those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by United States laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and by local
laws, such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all
of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices which violate
such laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.

The frequency of accounting policy changes may continue to accelerate. For example, standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect
the way we account for revenue related to our products and services. We expect that a significant portion of our games will be online-enabled in the future, and we could be required to recognize the
related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial
accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.

Due to recent economic turmoil and a general depression in stock prices, we could become the target of an unsolicited offer to acquire our shares of
common stock. An unsolicited offer could create volatility in our stock price, could create a distraction for our management and employees, and could cause uncertainty that may adversely affect our
business.

Due to significant price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets recently, we may become an attractive target for an unsolicited bid for shares of our common stock. An
unsolicited bid for shares of our common stock would be a distraction for our management and employees, and require the expenditure of significant time and resources by us and could cause our stock
price to fluctuate significantly. An unsolicited bid could also adversely impact our ability to recruit and retain employees and our ability to enter into agreements with potential business partners.
For example, in 2008, Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA")


launched
an unsolicited tender offer to acquire all of our outstanding shares of common stock. EA's unsolicited tender offer caused our stock price to fluctuate significantly, was a significant
distraction for our management, created uncertainty for our employees, and created uncertainty for current and potential publishers, developers, distributors and other business partners. Furthermore,
stockholder litigation in connection with EA's unsolicited tender offer resulted in, and continues to result in, significant legal costs. If we were to become the target of another unsolicited offer,
whether from EA or another party, we could be subject to any of the aforementioned concerns which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Various lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations are pending involving us and certain of our subsidiaries as described below in this section. Depending on the amount
and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition to the matters
described herein, we are, or may become, involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Consumer Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

In July 2005, we received four complaints for purported class actions,
which were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, alleged purchasers of our

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

game, assert that we engaged in consumer deception and false advertising, breached an implied warranty of merchantability and were unjustly enriched as a result of our
alleged failure to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained "hidden" content. The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of
various violations of law and litigation costs. Although the Court previously granted preliminary approval of a settlement of the foregoing consumer class action lawsuits, in July 2008 the Court
refused to certify the proposed


settlement
class on the basis that, under controlling case law issued after the parties negotiated the settlement, the plaintiffs could no longer meet their burden of showing that the case could
proceed on the proposed class basis, regardless of whether the purpose of certification was for litigation or settlement. The plaintiffs have applied for permission to appeal. We express no opinion as
to the likelihood of permission to appeal being granted or the outcome of any such appeal, and will continue to defend this case vigorously.

City of Los Angeles Consumer Litigation.

In January 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the
State of California alleging violations of California law on substantially the same basis as the consumer class action regarding

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

. The complaint seeks injunctive and other relief. The case was removed and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. We have engaged
in settlement discussions with the City of Los Angeles and expect that they will lead to a resolution of this matter after the resolution of such consumer class action.

Securities Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Option Backdating.

In February and March 2006, four purported class
action complaints were filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The actions were consolidated, and in April
2007 the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated second amended complaint which contained allegations related to purported "hidden content" contained in

Grand Theft
Auto: San Andreas

and the backdating of stock options, including the investigation thereof conducted by the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors and the
restatement of our financial statements relating thereto. This complaint was filed against us, our former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our former Chairman of the Board,
our Rockstar Games subsidiary, and one officer and one former officer of our Rockstar Games subsidiary. He sought unspecified compensatory damages and costs including attorneys' fees and expenses. In
April 2008, the Court dismissed, with leave to amend, all claims as to all defendants relating to

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

and certain claims as to
our former CEO, CFO and certain director defendants relating to the backdating of stock options. In September 2008, the lead plaintiff filed a third amended consolidated complaint seeking to reinstate
these claims. We express no opinion as to the outcome of the complaint and will continue to defend this case vigorously.

St. Clair Derivative Action.

In January 2006, the St. Clair Shores General Employees Retirement System filed a purported
class and derivative action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and
directors. The factual allegations in this action are similar to those in the securities class action described above. The plaintiff asserts that certain defendants breached their fiduciary duty by
selling their stock while in possession of certain material non-public information and that we violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
thereunder by failing to disclose material facts in our 2003, 2004 and 2005 proxy statements in which we solicited approval to increase share availability under our 2002 Stock Option Plan. The
plaintiff seeks the return of all profits from the alleged insider trading conducted by the individual defendants who sold our stock, unspecified compensatory damages with interest and its costs in
the action. In March 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the complaint based on, among other things, the Committee's conclusion that "future pursuit of this action is not in the
best interests of Take-Two or its shareholders." In August 2007, the plaintiff filed an Amended Derivative and Class Action Complaint alleging, among other things, that defendants breached
their fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of proxy statements from 2001 through 2005. In September 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint or to
consolidate certain of its claims with the securities class action. In July 2008, the Court dismissed all claims against us and all claims against all defendants that arose out of the plaintiff's
derivative claims. The Court expressly did not determine whether the remaining claims, which are related to the proxy statements, would entitle the putative class to monetary damages. We intend to
continue to vigorously defend against the remainder of the plaintiff's claims.


Derivative Action—Option Backdating.

In July and August 2006, shareholders Richard Lasky and Raeda Karadsheh filed purported
derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and directors. These
actions were consolidated in November 2006 and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in January 2007, which focused exclusively on our historical stock option granting practices, alleging
violations of federal and state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaints sought unspecified
damages against all of the individual defendants, reimbursement from certain of the defendants of bonuses or other incentive or equity-based compensation paid to them, equitable and other relief
relating to the proceeds from certain of the
defendants' alleged improper trading activity in our stock, adoption of certain corporate governance proposals and recovery of litigation costs. These matters were referred to the Special Litigation
Committee, which moved to dismiss certain parties from the litigation and to have any claims against the remaining parties be assigned to us for disposition by our management and Board of Directors.
The parties are awaiting a decision by the Court.

Strickland et al. Personal Injury Action.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of the Estates of Arnold Strickland, James Crump
and Ace Mealer brought an action in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against us, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc., Sony Corporation of America, Wal-Mart,
GameStop and Devin Moore, alleging under Alabama's manufacturers' liability and wrongful death statutes, that our video games resulted in "copycat violence" that caused the deaths of
Messrs. Strickland, Crump and Mealer by Mr. Moore. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants in excess of $600,000,000. In April 2006, the
plaintiffs amended the complaint to add a claim for civil conspiracy. Our motion to dismiss that claim is pending. At our request, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on October 30, 2008 to
consider the exclusion of certain expert testimony and a second hearing was held on December 18, 2008. There currently is no scheduling order in effect. We believe that the claims are without
merit and that this action is similar to lawsuits brought and uniformly dismissed by courts in other jurisdictions.

Stockholder Actions.

In March 2008, Patrick Solomon, a stockholder, filed a purported class action complaint in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware against us and certain of our officers and directors. The plaintiff contends that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allegedly refusing to
explore premium offers by Electronic Arts Inc. to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, enacting a bylaw amendment allegedly designed to entrench the current board by
preventing stockholders from nominating and electing alternative directors, agreeing to an amendment to a management agreement with ZelnickMedia and issuing a proxy statement for the 2008 annual
meeting of stockholders that allegedly contained misleading and incomplete information. The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, rescissory and other equitable relief and
damages. After certain voluntary actions were taken by the Company, the plaintiff agreed to withdraw his motion for preliminary injunctive relief, and the annual meeting went forward without
difficulty (and without any stockholders nominating directors or proposing business). Discovery on the remaining claims is ongoing. We believe the remaining claims lack merit, and intend to defend
vigorously against them.

In
April 2008, St. Clair Shores General Employees Retirement System, a stockholder, filed a purported derivative action on behalf of the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware against our directors and ZelnickMedia. The allegations are essentially the same as those in the Solomon stockholder action, above, with an additional complaint about the "poison pill"
adopted by our board in March 2008, and an additional claim against ZelnickMedia for aiding and abetting the directors' alleged breach of fiduciary duty. Because the action was duplicative, the
plaintiff agreed to stay all proceedings in the case in favor of the Solomon case. We believe the claims lack merit, and intend to defend vigorously against them. Also in April 2008, Michael Maulano,
an alleged stockholder, filed a purported class action in New York state court, New York County, against us and our directors.


We
intend to vigorously defend all of the above matters and, with respect to the derivative actions, we have been advised that the individual defendants will vigorously defend such actions. However,
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and, if determined adversely to us, such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in the imposition of significant judgments,
fines, penalties and/or injunctive relief, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Grand Jury Subpoenas.

In 2006, we received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting
production of documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including those relating to, among other things: the so-called "Hot Coffee" scenes in

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

;
the work of our Board of Directors, all board committees and the Special Litigation Committee; certain acquisitions
entered into by us; billing and payment records relating to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the termination of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our auditors; communications to financial
analysts and stockholders about acquisitions and financial results; compensation and human resources documents of certain of our directors and employees and former directors and employees; stock-based
compensation; the SEC's July 2006 inquiry; legal services performed for employees; corporate credit card and expense records of certain individuals; the SEC bar of our former Chief Executive Officer,
Ryan Brant; the resolution to amend our Incentive Stock Plan; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies and questionnaires. Over time, the District Attorney's investigation focused on
options backdating. We have fully cooperated and provided the documents and information called for by the subpoenas.

SEC Investigation.

In July 2006, we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting an informal non-public investigation of
certain stock option grants made from January 1997 to 2006 and in April 2007 we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting a formal investigation of such stock option grants. As a result of
the Special Litigation Committee's internal review of our option grants, in February 2007 we restated our financial statements for prior periods in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. In August 2007, we received a "Wells" notice from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informing us of its intention to request
authority to file charges, and to seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with its investigation. We submitted a response to the Staff's notice in September 2007, urging that no charges should be
brought against us. We have continued to cooperate with the Staff and we continue to expect to resolve this investigation by means of a settlement rather than a contested litigation of charges.

Tax Inquiries.

We have been in contact with and have received requests for information from several taxing authorities for records relating
to the grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken by us from October 2000 to October 2006.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008.

declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends in the future is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, capital
requirements and other relevant factors. Our current credit agreement restricts the payment of dividends on our stock.

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Overview

Our Business

We are a global publisher, developer and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our publishing segment consists of our Rockstar Games, 2K
Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play publishing labels. We develop, market and publish software titles for the leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms including: Sony's PLAYSTATION®3
("PS3") and PlayStation2® ("PS2") computer entertainment systems; Sony's PSP® (PlayStation®Portable) ("PSP") system; Microsoft's Xbox 360®
("Xbox 360") video game and entertainment system; Nintendo's Wii™ ("Wii") and DS™ ("DS") systems; and for the PC and Games for Windows®. The installed base
for the prior generation console platforms, including PS2 ("prior generation platforms") is substantial. The release of the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii platforms ("current generation platforms") has
further expanded the video game software market. Our plan is to diversify and continue to expand the number of titles released on the current generation platforms while continuing to market titles
developed for prior generation platforms given their significant installed base, as long as it is economically attractive to do so. Our distribution segment, which primarily consists of our Jack of
All Games subsidiary, distributes our products as well as software, hardware and accessories produced by others to retail outlets in North America. We have pursued a strategy of capitalizing on the
widespread market acceptance of interactive entertainment, as well as the growing popularity of innovative action, adventure, racing, role-playing, sports and strategy games that appeal to
the expanding demographic of video game players.

We
endeavor to be the most creative, innovative and efficient company in our industry. Our strategy is to capitalize on the expanding demographics of video game players, and focus on creating premium
quality games and successful franchises for which we can create sequels. We have established a portfolio of successful proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of
genres including action, adventure, racing, role-playing, sports and strategy. We believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength, allowing us to
differentiate many of our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling story lines and characters to provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers. We have created,
acquired or licensed a group of highly recognizable brands to match the variety of consumer demographics we aspire to serve, ranging from adults to children and hard-core game enthusiasts
to casual gamers.

We
publish our titles under four separate labels: Rockstar Games, 2K Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play, with each label focused on distinct product genres and target demographics. We expect Rockstar Games,
our wholly-owned publisher of the hit

Grand Theft Auto

and

Midnight Club

franchises, to continue to be a
leader in the action product category by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands. We expect 2K Games, publisher of the internally developed, successful

Sid Meier's Civilization

series and the critically acclaimed

BioShock

title, to continue to develop new
and successful franchises in the future. Our 2K Sports series, which includes

Major League Baseball 2K

,

NBA
2K

and

NHL 2K,

are published on an annual basis and provide us with revenue streams that are consistent relative to our other
products. We established the 2K Play label to focus on the growing market of casual and family-oriented games.

Carnival Games

has been a strong
performing title, and 2K Play has continued to grow the franchise through sequels and product extensions. 2K Play also has a partnership with Nickelodeon to publish video games based on top rated Nick
Jr. titles such as

Dora the Explorer

and

Go, Diego, Go!

. We have expansion initiatives in the rapidly
growing Asia Pacific markets, where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products, develop a presence in Japan, and establish an online gaming presence, especially in China and
Korea.

Revenue
in our publishing segment is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed on our behalf by third parties. Operating margins in our
publishing


business
are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new, commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs. We develop most of our frontline products
internally and own the intellectual property associated with most of our titles, which we believe best positions us financially and competitively. We have internal development studios located in the
United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Czech Republic and China.

Operating
margins associated with our externally developed titles, or titles for which we do not own the intellectual property, are generally lower because they require us to acquire licenses, provide
minimum development guarantees, and pay third party royalties. Agreements with third party developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make advance royalty
payments, pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions. We continue to develop new revenue streams as they evolve, including higher margin sources such as downloadable content,
which we expect will become more significant to our business over time. We announced plans to
leverage our wholly-owned intellectual property,

BioShock

, by allowing Universal Pictures to develop it into a feature film.

Revenue
in our distribution segment is derived from the sale of third party software titles, accessories and hardware in North America. Operating margins in our distribution business depend in large
part on the mix of software and hardware sales, with software sales generally yielding higher margins than hardware. We have focused on improving margins in our distribution business. In 2008, we sold
certain assets of our distribution segment pertaining to the warehouse management, processing and value-added service operations of our distribution facility to Ditan Distribution LLC
("Ditan"), a logistics management solutions provider. In addition, we agreed to outsource the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions for our publishing and distribution businesses to Ditan. We
believe this will allow Jack of All Games to better focus on purchasing, sales and service for their customers.

Recent Developments

During the year ended October 31, 2008, Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA") extended a tender offer to our stockholders (the "Offer") to acquire all outstanding shares of
our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors, upon the advice of its financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Offer was inadequate and recommended that stockholders not accept it. The
Offer was extended several times through August 2008, at which time the Offer expired. Our management and Board commenced a formal process to review strategic alternatives beginning in April 2008 that
included discussions with potential interested parties. In October 2008, we announced the conclusion of our strategic review process. We incurred $11.1 million of costs in 2008 related to the
EA Offer and our strategic review process.

2008 Financial Summary

The release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

on April 29, 2008 highlighted our 2008 fiscal year, driving a significant increase in
revenue and net income. It has been reported that the title surpassed all-time entertainment records for first day and first week retail sales, with approximately six million units
purchased by consumers globally in the first week at an estimated retail value of more than $500 million.

Overall,
we believe that our product lineup grew stronger in 2008, marked by the continued success of our critically acclaimed

BioShock,

a wholly owned
and internally developed title for Xbox 360 and Games for Windows® that debuted in late fiscal year 2007. We shipped over three million units of

BioShock

on the Xbox 360, PC and PS3
through October 2008. In addition, we announced that Universal Pictures is developing a feature film based
on

BioShock

to be directed by Gore Verbinski, director of the

Pirates of the Caribbean

trilogy.

The
2008 fiscal year evidenced a distinct shift in focus toward casual game play and the Wii home video game system from Nintendo continued its popularity.

Carnival
Games

™, our wholly owned and internally developed title for the Wii and DS, continued its success in 2008 and exceeded expectations for sales and profitability.
Through October 31, 2008 we had shipped over two million units of

Carnival Games

since it made its debut in late fiscal year 2007. In October
2008, we expanded the franchise with

Carnival Games

™

MiniGolf

.

In
2008, our 2K label acquired 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion Softworks, a studio based in the Czech Republic and the developer of the

Mafia

franchise. In addition, our sports titles performed better than in prior years, primarily benefiting from the release of

Top Spin 3

in the third quarter
of 2008. However, we continue to face increased competition in the sports genre.

We
are focusing on improving the margins in our distribution business. In 2008 we sold certain assets of our distribution segment pertaining to the warehouse management, processing and value-added
service operations of our distribution facility to Ditan and outsourced the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions for our publishing and distribution business to Ditan.

The
increased installed base of current generation hardware platforms also helped to improve our business in 2008. As a result, we continued to make significant investments in current generation game
development. We expect sales on the prior generation platforms to continue to decline because of the ongoing hardware transition and have therefore reduced the number of titles in development for
these platforms. We have reduced pricing on several of our software titles for the prior generation platforms as the market for that generation continues to decline and the current generation hardware
installed base grows.

In
April 2008, we amended our Management Agreement with ZelnickMedia. The amended agreement provides for management fees of $2.5 million ($0.75 million prior to the amendment that was
effective as of April 1, 2008) and a maximum bonus of $2.5 million per fiscal year ($0.75 million prior to the amendment that was effective as of April 1, 2008) based on
the Company achieving certain performance thresholds. The amendment also provided for a grant of 600,000 shares of restricted stock to ZelnickMedia that vest annually over a three year period, and
900,000 shares of restricted stock that vest over a four year period through 2012, provided that the price of our common stock outperforms 75% of the companies in the NASDAQ Industrial Index. The
shares were granted on June 13, 2008. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our stock compensation expense.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make
estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates, assumptions


and
judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis,
management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events
and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.

We
have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require management's most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations
is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed
discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Management has reviewed these critical
accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue
Recognition," in conjunction with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software titles when there is
(1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or
determinable and (4) collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms. Advances received for
licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue.

Some
of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer. Generally, we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an
inconsequential deliverable. Accordingly, we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features. We determine whether our products contain substantial online functionality by
evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features, the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features; the significance of the online features
to the customers' anticipated overall gameplay experience, and the significance of our post sale obligations to customers. Overall, online play functionality is still an emerging area for us, and we
continue to monitor this developing functionality and its significance to our products.

Certain
of our software products include in-game advertising for third party products. Advance payments received for in-game advertising are reported on the balance sheet as
deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue, which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product.

Revenue
is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns, price concessions and other allowances. In circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price
concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine
that collection of the receivable is probable.

Allowances for Returns, Price Concessions and Other Allowances

We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of our products, we grant price concessions to
permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. Our customers must satisfy


certain
conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions, including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.

Our
distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock
balancing and make accommodations to customers, which include credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations.

We
make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based
upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of
sell-through rates, sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers.

Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We believe we can make
reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments
to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Software Development Costs and Licenses

Capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to third party software developers under development
agreements.

We
capitalize internal software development costs (including stock-based compensation, specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and
release of titles), third party production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title. Technological feasibility of a product includes the
completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation.

We
enter into agreements with third party developers that require us to make advance payments for game development and production services. In exchange for our advance payments, we receive the
exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. Such agreements allow us to fully recover the advance
payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software, net of any agreed upon costs. We capitalize all advance payments to developers as
software development costs. On a product-by-product basis, we reduce software development costs and record a corresponding amount of research and development expense for any
costs incurred by third party developers prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product. We typically enter into agreements with third party developers after completing the technical
design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense. When we contract with third party
developers, we generally select third party developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed, which often allows for the establishment of
technological feasibility early in the development cycle. In instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract, we monitor the software
development process and require our third party developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products.

Licenses
consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our
products. Agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property. Guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an
asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) upon execution of a licensing agreement, provided that no significant


performance
remains to be completed by the licensor. When significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor, we record payments when actually paid.

Certain
licenses, especially those related to our sports products, extend over multi-year periods and encompass multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments, these
licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds.

Amortization
of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a title-by-title basis in cost of goods sold. For
capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using (1) the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or
(2) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title, whichever is greater. For capitalized licenses, amortization is calculated as a ratio of
(1) current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or (2) the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as
defined in the licensing agreement, whichever is greater.

At
each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs, licenses and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that
have not been paid, using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis. We use various measures to evaluate expected product performance and estimate future revenues for our software titles including
historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.
When management determines that the value of a title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales, capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is
made.

We
have established internal royalty programs that allow that certain of our employees participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing. Royalties earned by employees under
this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred.

Asset Impairment

Business Combinations—Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

The purchase method of accounting requires that assets acquired and
liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business acquisition. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the
completion date of an acquisition. The costs to acquire a business, including transaction, integration and restructuring costs, are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired upon acquisition.
Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

We
evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant
level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. We generally use either the income, cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions
of such fair values and asset lives. The income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset, discounted to
present value. The cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its
replacement or reproduction cost. The market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets. Although each valuation approach is
considered in valuing the assets acquired, the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information. Changes in our strategy and/or market
conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances.

Long-lived assets.

We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether


impairment
has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful life over which
cash flows will occur, their amount and the asset's residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information
available. We use internal discounted cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. We derive the required cash flow
estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment

("SFAS 123").
Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including, in the case of stock option awards, estimating expected stock volatility. In addition,
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation
expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted.

We
have granted stock options to non-employees, which are subject to variable accounting. When variable accounting is applied to stock option grants, we re-measure the fair
value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised. Compensation expense in any given period is calculated as the difference
between total earned compensation at the end of the period, less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period, both of which are based on the price of our common stock at such dates. As a
result, fluctuations in the price of our common stock will change compensation expense or benefit recognized by us each reporting period.

We
have also granted service and market based restricted stock awards to employees and non-employees. Service based awards to non-employees and market based awards are subject
to variable accounting. For the service based restricted stock grants to non-employees, we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end of every period based on the month end closing
price of our common stock. Market based restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index. We calculate the fair value of market based restricted
stock using a Monte Carlo Simulation method, which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting probabilities. As a
result, expense recorded for our non-employee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period.

Income Taxes

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely
than not to be realized. Our cumulative pre-tax loss in recent fiscal years represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the
deferred tax asset is appropriate. This valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items.

Our
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We
regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.


On November 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return
by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including
resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The
cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was $1.1 million, and was recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.

At
each period end, it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax
jurisdictions, amounts of permanent and temporary differences, the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks. These estimates and assumptions are
revised as new events occur, more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained. The impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they
become known.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 157,

Fair
Value Measurements

("SFAS 157"), which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior
accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (November 1, 2008 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal
years. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FAS 157-2 which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date
of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (November 1, 2009 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this
FSP. On October 10, 2008 the FASB issued FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is
Not Active

, which clarifies the application of SFAS 157, in a market that is not active. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 157, FSP
FAS 157-2 and FSP FAS 157-3 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

("SFAS 159").
SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards, which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS 159, a company may
elect to use fair value to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities, on an instrument-by-instrument basis. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized
gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes
in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (November 1, 2008 for the Company), with earlier adoption
permitted. We did not adopt SFAS 159 prior to November 1, 2008 and do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
June 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force's ("EITF") consensus conclusion on EITF 07-03,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments
for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development

. EITF 07-03 addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the
non-refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities. Under this conclusion, an entity is required to defer and
capitalize


non-refundable
advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. EITF 07-03 is
effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 (November 1, 2008 for the Company), and requires prospective application for new
contracts entered into after the effective date. We do not expect that the adoption of EITF 07-03 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or
results of operations.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

("SFAS 141(R)"). This Statement provides greater consistency in
the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction,
establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial
effect of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 (November 1, 2009 for the Company) and interim periods within
those years, with earlier adoption prohibited. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of
operations.

In
April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

("FSP
FAS 142-3"). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of
recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This guidance for determining the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset applies prospectively to intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets in either an asset acquisition or business combination. FSP
FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2008 (November 1, 2009 for the Company), and early adoption is prohibited. We do not expect that the adoption of FSP
FAS 142-3 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities

("FSP EITF 03-6-1"), which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before they vest will be considered participating securities and
included in the basic earnings per share calculation. The Company is assessing the impact of adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on its results of operations.

Fluctuations in Operating Results and Seasonality

We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of: the timing of the introduction of new titles; variations in sales of titles developed
for particular platforms; market acceptance of our titles; development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles, sequels or enhancements of existing titles; projected and
actual changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors; product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors; the size and timing of
acquisitions; the timing of orders from major customers; order cancellations; and delays in product shipment. Sales of our products are also seasonal, with peak shipments typically occurring in the
fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters) as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season. Quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not
necessarily indicative of future operating results.

The increase in net revenue primarily reflects higher sales of titles from our

Grand Theft Auto

franchise
predominantly due to our release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

in the second quarter of 2008. Total net revenue generated from our

Grand Theft Auto

titles was
$581.4 million higher in the 2008 period. Our

Midnight Club

franchise
also contributed $66.7 million to the increase in net revenue in the 2008 period due to the release of

Midnight Club: Los Angeles

in October
2008. In addition, we have seen continued success of our

Carnival Games

franchise, which debuted in the fourth quarter of 2007 with

Carnival Games

for the
Wii and increased net revenue by $53.3 million in 2008 and growth in our family-oriented game market with the release of

Dora the Explorer

and

Go, Diego, Go!

titles based on top rated Nickelodeon television shows which
contributed $17.3 million in net revenue in 2008. Furthermore, net revenue generated from our sports business increased by $9.2 million due to our release of

Top
Spin 3

in 2008, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the performance of our

Major League Baseball

franchise. These
increases were partially offset by lower revenue earned from our titles

The Darkness, The Elder Scrolls IV

®,

Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer

and

Ghost Rider

™

and

which were $112.0 million higher in the prior period, reflecting sales generated in connection with their release in the
third quarter of
2007. Also,

BioShock,

which was released on the PS3 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and on the Xbox 360 and PC in the fourth quarter of 2007, had
lower net revenue of $54.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007.

Consumer
demand for the PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii systems increased in 2008, helping to boost our sales on current generation platforms. Sales on current generation platforms accounted for
approximately 82.3% of our total net publishing revenue in the 2008 period. PS3 and Xbox 360 software sales for 2008 increased from 2007 by $347.0 million and $281.5 million,
respectively, primarily due to the success of

Grand Theft Auto IV

. Wii software sales accounted for $112.0 million of our net publishing revenue
in 2008, reflecting higher sales of

Carnival Games

and an increase in the number of titles we released on the Wii such as

Major
League Baseball

®

2K8

and

Top Spin 3

. Sales on the prior
generation platforms decreased by $96.3 million, mainly reflecting decreased sales of

Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer

and

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City
Stories

in 2008. We expect sales on the prior generation platforms to continue to decline as a result of the hardware
transition and have therefore reduced the number of titles in development for these platforms. We have reduced pricing on several of our software titles for the prior generation platforms as the
current generation hardware installed base grows. Handheld sales increased by $13.3 million, primarily due to the release of

Midnight Club: LA
Remix

on the PSP and sales of our Nickelodeon titles

Dora the Explorer

and

Go, Diego,
Go!

and

Carnival Games

that released on the DS. PC sales decreased by $52.5 million, primarily due to decreased sales of

BioShock

and

The Elder Scrolls IV: The Shivering Isles

™, which were released in 2007.


Gross
profit as a percentage of net revenue increased significantly due to the release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

in 2008, as this title was internally
developed and the intellectual property is wholly-owned. Product costs decreased as a percentage of net revenue, primarily due to the volume based manufacturing discounts we received related to the
release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

. Internal royalties increased as a percentage of net revenue, again reflecting increased sales of our

Grand Theft Auto

titles.

Excluding
the impact of

Grand Theft Auto IV

, product costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly, mainly due to the 2007 period which
included a $5.2 million impairment charge related to intellectual property. Software development costs and royalties decreased in 2008 as a percentage of net revenue, mainly due to a larger
share of revenues generated from internally developed titles. Internal royalty costs as percentage of net revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year. License costs increased slightly
as a percentage of net revenue due to both higher royalty expense and lower revenue generated from our

Major League Baseball

license, partially offset
by lower licensing rates in connection with other 2008 titles, including

Don King Presents: Prizefighter

and

Top Spin

. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, excluding the impact of

Grand Theft Auto IV

, increased by 2.3% in the 2008
period, mainly due a higher proportion of internally developed titles including

Bully: Scholarship Edition

,

Midnight Club: Los
Angeles, Sid Meier's Civilization

®

Revolution

™, and

Top Spin

and the continued success of

Carnival Games.

In addition, in 2008 our

NBA 2K9

title had higher gross margins than its predecessor game due to higher revenues on a comparable amount of software development costs.

Revenue
earned from licensing our intellectual property to third parties increased to $33.2 million in 2008 from $30.8 million in 2007, primarily due to our October 2008 release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

for the PS3 and Xbox 360 in Japan, which was partially offset by the July 2007 release of

Grand Theft
Auto: Liberty City Stories

for the PS2 and PSP in Japan. We recognize higher gross profit margins on revenue earned in connection with licensing our products.

Revenue
earned outside of North America accounted for approximately 43.5% of our net revenue in 2008 compared to 34.7% in 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to our simultaneous global
release of

Grand Theft Auto IV

and

Midnight Club: Los Angeles

for the PS3 and Xbox 360. Foreign
exchange rates increased revenue by approximately $20.4 million in 2008.

Net
revenue associated with software for current generation platforms increased $29.5 million and hardware sales increased $16.8 million, reflecting increased availability of current
generation platforms, especially the Wii. In addition, PC software sales increased $6.8 million. Offsetting the current year increases were lower sales of prior generation software of
$19.1 million, reflecting a shift in consumer demand for newer software. We experienced a decline in software sales for Nintendo handheld devices and peripherals of $15.9 million.

In
September 2008, we sold certain assets of our distribution segment, including warehouse management, processing and value-added service operations of our distribution facility, to Ditan. In
addition, we agreed to outsource the pick, pack, ship and warehousing functions for our publishing and distribution businesses to Ditan. This arrangement did not have a material impact on our gross
margins in the current year but we do anticipate improved gross margins in 2009 because the arrangement will then have been in effect for a full year.


Foreign
currency exchange rates increased net revenue by approximately $5.8 million in 2008, as a result of a stronger Canadian dollar throughout most of 2008 and an increased proportion of
international
sales. The decrease in gross margin mainly related to a $3.7 million write-down of inventory in 2008 in conjunction with our plan to reduce the number of titles that we manage and
distribute in order to focus on higher gross margin products and improve the division's operating efficiency. Excluding the write-down of inventory, the gross margin would have increased
to 10.0% in 2008, primarily due to increased bundling of software with hardware.

Selling and marketing

Selling
and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue in 2008, reflecting the revenue contribution of

Grand Theft Auto IV

. However
costs increased $36.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to:

i.

an
increase in advertising expense of $22.7 million, mainly related to the releases of

Grand Theft Auto IV

and

Midnight Club: Los Angeles

;

ii.

a
$9.0 million increase in personnel costs, mainly resulting from higher incentive compensation expense that was based on overall company performance, higher stock-based
compensation costs due to timing of awards and severance costs incurred in our European territories; and

iii.

a
$2.6 million increase related to expansion initiatives in Asia Pacific markets, trade shows and promotional events related to

Grand Theft Auto
IV

and

Midnight Club: Los Angeles

.

General
and administrative

General
and administrative expenses increased $21.0 million in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to:

i.

an
increase of $15.2 million for management fees and stock-based compensation expensed in connection with our service agreement with ZelnickMedia;

ii.

$11.1 million
of legal and consulting expenses related to the EA offer; and


iii.

an
increase of approximately $3.4 million in personnel costs mainly related to an increase in incentive compensation that was based on overall company performance in fiscal
2008; partially offset by

iv.

a
decrease of approximately $5.3 million in personnel costs mainly resulting from our business reorganization initiatives.

General
and administrative expenses for 2008 and 2007 also includes occupancy expense (primarily rent, utilities and office expenses) of $13.6 million and $14.9 million, respectively,
related to our development studios.

Research
and development

Research
and development expenses increased $15.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to:

i.

a
$12.3 million increase in personnel expense, mainly for higher stock-based compensation costs due to the timing of awards and payroll-related expenses in our European studios,
coupled with lower software capitalization rates; and

ii.

an
increase of $2.1 million in technology related costs, primarily due to studio acquisitions and the acquisition of 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion Softworks.

Business
reorganization and related costs

In
2007 we announced a business reorganization plan to renew and optimize our management and organizational structure. Accordingly, we incurred business reorganization and related expenses of
$17.5 million in 2007 consisting of employee termination costs of $10.1 million, $2.9 million of facility related and relocation costs to move our 2K headquarters to California,
and $4.4 million in professional fees and other costs related to the replacement of prior management and the election of five new directors to our Board of Directors at our annual stockholders'
meeting. In 2008 we substantially completed our business reorganization and incurred costs of $4.5 million consisting mainly of further employee termination, facility related and relocation
costs in connection with the closure of two studios. As a result, we do not expect to incur material reorganization charges related to this plan in 2009.

In
2007, we sold substantially all of the assets, primarily inventory and accounts receivable, of our wholly-owned Joytech video game accessories subsidiary, formerly a component of our publishing
segment, to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. for approximately $3.6 million in cash and notes receivable, resulting in a recognized loss on the sale of $3.1 million. The disposition of
Joytech did not involve a significant amount of assets or materially impact our operating results.

Also,
in 2007, we recognized a loss of $1.4 million when we deconsolidated the net assets of Blue Castle Games, Inc. ("Blue Castle"), which was previously accounted for, in accordance
with FIN 46(R), as a wholly-owned subsidiary and considered to be a variable interest entity. Blue Castle continues to develop certain of our sports titles; however, we are no longer considered
to be the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle's profits or losses.

2008, we incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of $5.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2008, reflecting a strengthening United States dollar in the fourth quarter of
2008, compared to a foreign exchange transaction gain of $1.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2007.

Provision for income taxes.

Income tax expense was $15.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2008,
as compared to $10.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2007. Our effective tax rate differed from the
federal statutory rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and the application of net operating losses carried forward to 2008 taxable income. The use of the net operating losses enabled the
reversal of valuation allowances of $19.3 million in 2008, while the 2007 taxable loss required an increase to the valuation allowance of $40.6 million last year.

We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments.

Net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.

For the year ended October 31, 2008, net income was
$97.1 million, compared to a net loss of $138.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2007. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended October 31, 2008 was
$1.29 and $1.28, respectively, compared to a loss per share of $1.93 for the year ended October 31, 2007. Weighted average shares outstanding increased compared to the prior period, mainly due
to an increase in the exercise of stock options as a result of a higher average stock price in the 2008 period and the issuance of 1,496,647 shares of restricted stock in connection with our
acquisition of 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion Softworks.

Net revenue from our

Grand Theft Auto

franchise was $103.7 million lower in 2007, reflecting a decrease
from the strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for PS2 and PSP in the prior year. In addition, net revenue related to

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,

which was released in the second quarter of 2006, was approximately $63.1 million lower in 2007. Partially
offsetting the decline in our net revenue were sales of

BioShock,

our new title that was released in the fourth quarter of 2007 on the Xbox 360
and PC, and which had sales of $85.1 million. In addition, revenue from our baseball titles increased by $38.2 million due to better performance of

Major League
Baseball

®

2K7

compared to its predecessor title and a greater number of product releases, including

The BIGS

on five platforms
and

MLB

®

Power
Pros

on two platforms.


Although consumer demand for the PS3 system did not increase as quickly as anticipated in 2007, revenue for our titles for that platform accounted for $66.2 million, or 9.6%, of our net
publishing revenue. Nintendo's Wii system sold at a stronger than expected rate in 2007; our software sales for the Wii system accounted for $35.5 million, or 5.1%, of our net publishing
revenue in 2007. Software sales for the Xbox 360 accounted for 29.7% of net revenue and increased $31.2 million, or 17.9%, again reflecting the 2007 sales of

BioShock

for this platform of
$63.1 million, offset by a decrease of $34.4 million in sales of

The Elder Scrolls
IV: Oblivion

. Software sales for the PSP handheld system decreased $68.9 million in 2007, primarily due to the strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto:
Liberty City Stories

in 2006. Sales for the PS2 and Xbox prior generation systems decreased $81.2 million due to the continuing hardware transition and increased
availability of the PS3 and Xbox 360. We have also continued to reduce prices of our software titles for the PS2 and Xbox platforms as the current generation hardware installed base grows.
Software sales for PC declined $31.6 million, or 25.3%, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease in revenue for sales of

The Elder Scrolls IV:
Oblivion

for PC, and a $14.1 million decrease in sales of our

Sid Meier's Civilization

series, both of which were
released in 2006. The decrease was partially offset by sales of

BioShock

for the PC of $22.0 million in 2007.

Product
costs as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent compared to 2006. Software development costs decreased in 2007, reflecting the above average external royalty costs for

The Elder Scrolls IV:
Oblivion

and approximately $18.8 million of impairment charges for unreleased titles in 2006. We recorded
$4.1 million of impairment charges for unreleased titles in 2007. In addition, in 2007 we were able to realize a significant increase in the gross profit margin of our internally developed
titles, particularly

BioShock

and our sports products. Both

Major League Baseball 2K7

and our

NBA 2K

series
had significantly higher gross margins than their predecessor games due to higher revenues on a comparable amount of software development
costs. Internal royalty expense was lower as a percentage of net revenue in 2007 as a result of fewer Rockstar titles being released and significantly lower sales of

Grand
Theft Auto

products. License expense was a greater percentage of net revenue in 2007, reflecting the releases of

All-Pro Football 2K8,
Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Ghost Rider

and

The Darkness,

compared to

24: The Game, The
Da Vinci Code,

and

Torino 2006

™ in 2006. Sports licensing costs, however, were a lower percentage of net revenue,
particularly for our baseball titles where we had a greater number of products released and higher overall revenues than in 2006.

Revenue
earned from licensing our intellectual property to third parties increased to $30.8 million in 2007 from $10.9 million in 2006, primarily related to our January 2007 release of

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

for the PS2 and the July 2007 release of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City
Stories

for the PS2 and PSP in Japan. We recognize substantially higher gross profit margins on revenue earned in connection with licensing our products.

Revenue
earned outside of North America accounted for approximately $239.9 million in 2007 compared to $305.1 million in 2006. The year-over-year decrease was
primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

and

The Elder Scrolls IV:
Oblivion

. Foreign exchange rates benefited revenue by approximately $18.7 million in 2007.

revenue associated with software sales for current generation platforms increased $23.3 million, which reflected the releases of PS3 and Wii hardware in the first quarter of 2007
and the continuing increase in the installed base of the Xbox 360. Current generation software also has higher


price
points than their predecessor products. In addition, sales of hardware increased $7.9 million, or 8.4%, due to the introduction of the PS3 and Wii systems. The increase in net revenue was
partially offset by a decrease in prior generation software sales of $14.8 million in 2007 as a result of the continued decline in sales volume and average selling price of value and frontline
software titles as the gaming industry transitions to current generation platforms. In addition, we experienced a decline in sales of our PC products of $10.0 million, or 18.5%. Foreign
currency exchange rates increased net revenue by approximately $2.8 million in 2007. Gross profit margins remained relatively consistent compared to the prior year.

Selling and marketing

Selling
and marketing expenses decreased $8.6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to:

i.

$5.3 million
more in marketing and promotion expenditures in 2006 mainly attributable to advertising campaigns for our

Grand Theft
Auto

products; and

ii.

$2.5 million
less in marketing at the annual E3 trade show event in 2007 as a result of the industry wide downsizing of the event compared to past years.

General
and administrative

General
and administrative expenses decreased $5.8 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to:

i.

$6.2 million
less in stock-based compensation expense, reflecting cost savings associated with the departure of our former management team;

ii.

approximately
$2.8 million of cost savings in 2007 as a result of our 2006 studio closures, for which we recorded $1.9 million of severance and lease termination
expenses in 2006; and

iii.

$2.3 million
recorded in 2006 related to the relocation of our international publishing headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland, partially offset by;

iv.

higher
expenses related to information technology system improvements of approximately $2.6 million in 2007.

General
and administrative expenses for 2007 and 2006 also includes occupancy expense (primarily rent, utilities and office expenses) of $14.9 million and $15.2 million, respectively,
related to our development studios.


Research
and development

Research
and development expenses decreased $15.8 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to:

i.

approximately
$3.5 million of severance expense recorded in 2006 relating to the termination of research and development employees resulting from studio closures; and

ii.

$12.3 million
higher software capitalization costs as a result of increased development work in progress for technologically feasible current generation platform titles.

Business
reorganization and related costs

Business
reorganization and related expenses were $17.5 million in 2007. There were no business reorganization expenses incurred in 2006. Business reorganization and related expenses in 2007
include employee termination costs of $10.1 million, primarily as a result of severance for former management and consolidating our international operations. In 2007 we recorded
$2.9 million of facility related and relocation costs for our 2K headquarters move to California. In total, we spent $4.4 million on professional fees and other costs related to the
replacement of prior management and the election of five new directors to our Board of Directors at our annual stockholders' meeting (rather than the six incumbent directors nominated and recommended
by our incumbent Board of Directors), $2.0 million of which was investment banking fees incurred by prior management to consider the possibility of presenting alternative proposals to our
stockholders, including a potential sale of the Company.

Impairment of long-lived assets

In 2006, we recorded an impairment charge of $8.1 million related to goodwill and fixed assets at our Joytech subsidiary, a manufacturer and distributor of video game
accessories, which operates within our publishing segment. The impairment charges reflected a decline in the fair value of Joytech's business resulting from increased competition and a decline in the
price and sales volume of prior generation accessories due to weaker market conditions and the ongoing transition to current generation platforms. Additional impairment charges of approximately
$7.5 million were related to the write-off of certain trademarks, acquired intangibles, investments and fixed assets. These write-offs were based on management's
assessment of the future value of these assets, including future business prospects and estimated cash flows to be derived from these assets.

In
September 2007, we sold substantially all of the assets, primarily inventory and accounts receivable, of our wholly-owned Joytech video game accessories subsidiary, formerly a
component of our publishing segment, for approximately $3.6 million in cash. The disposition of Joytech did not involve a significant amount of assets or materially impact our operating
results. We recognized a $3.1 million loss on the sale of our Joytech business.

In
the fourth quarter of 2007, we recognized a loss of $1.4 million when we deconsolidated the net assets of Blue Castle Games, Inc., which was previously accounted for, in accordance
with FIN 46(R), as a wholly-owned subsidiary and considered to be a variable interest entity. Blue Castle continues to develop certain of our sports titles; however, we are no longer considered
to be the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle's future profits or losses.


Provision for income taxes.

Income tax expense of $10.2 million for 2007 was higher than the
$0.4 million expense for 2006 due to our ability in 2006 to carry back losses to prior years, thereby taking a tax benefit for a portion of the net operating loss generated in 2006. No such
carry back is available for our 2007 loss. We recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $63.5 million in 2006 and increased it by $40.6 million in 2007 based on the uncertainty of
the realization of certain deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate differed from the federal, state and foreign statutory rates primarily due to the recording of valuation allowances.

We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments.

Net loss and loss per share.

For the year ended October 31, 2007, net loss was $138.4 million,
compared to $184.9 million in 2006. Net loss per share for the year ended October 31, 2007 was $1.93, compared to $2.60 in 2006. Weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat
compared to the prior period and did not have a significant impact on our loss per share.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements have been to fund (i) the development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products (ii) working capital
(iii) acquisitions and (iv) capital expenditures. Historically, we have relied on funds provided by operating activities and short and long-term borrowings to satisfy our
working capital needs.

In
July 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo which was amended and restated in November 2007 (the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for borrowings
of up to $140.0 million and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement expires on July 3, 2012. Revolving loans under
the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at our election of (a) 2.00% to 2.50% above a certain base rate (8.00% at October 31, 2008), or (b) 3.25% to 3.75% above the LIBOR Rate
with a minimum 4.00% LIBOR Rate (7.25% at October 31, 2008). We are also required to pay an annual fee on the unused available balance, ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% based on amounts borrowed.

Availability
under the Amended Credit Agreement is restricted by our domestic and United Kingdom based accounts receivable and inventory balance. The Amended Credit Agreement also allows for the
issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $25.0 million.

As
of October 31, 2008 there were $70.0 million of borrowings and $29.0 million was available for additional borrowings. We had $11.6 million of letters of credit
outstanding at October 31, 2008 and were in compliance with all covenants and requirements in the Amended Credit Agreement.

We
are subject to credit risks, particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets. If we are unable to collect our accounts
receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position.

Generally,
we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers. Effective March 1, 2008, we
have purchased trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk.

As
of October 31, 2008 and 2007, amounts due from our five largest customers comprised approximately 39.0% and 54.4% of our gross accounts receivable balance, respectively, with our significant
customers (those that individually comprised more than 10% of our gross accounts receivable balance) accounting for 11.8% and 41.9% of such balance at October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection experience, although we actively monitor each customer's credit
worthiness and economic conditions that may impact our customers' business and access to capital. We are monitoring the current turmoil in the economy, the global contraction of current credit and
other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable.


We have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years. Generally, these include:

•

Agreements
to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights and technology for use in the publishing, marketing and distribution of our software
titles. Our licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players' associations and expire at various times through October 2012;

•

Contractual
advances and royalty payments to third party software developers that expire at various times through November 2010. Guaranteed minimum payments assume
satisfactory performance;

•

Operating
leases, primarily related to occupancy, furniture and equipment, expiring at various times through June 2015; and

•

A
distribution services agreement to outsource non-core elements (shipping, receiving, warehouse management and related functions) of our publishing and
distribution business to Ditan through September 2013.

A

In
addition to the cash commitments above, we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration, typically contingent on the acquired
company achieving certain financial, unit sales, or performance conditions. The amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable. See Note 5 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments.

At
October 31, 2008, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $26.4 million for which we were unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities
will be settled with the respective tax authorities. Thus, these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

We
believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations, along with availability under our Amended Credit Agreement, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to
satisfy our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months.


Our
cash and cash equivalents increased by $202.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2008 as follows:

At
October 31, 2008 we had $280.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $77.8 million at October 31, 2007, an increase of $202.5 million. Cash from
operations increased substantially in 2008, primarily because of sales of

Grand Theft Auto IV

and collection of 2007 accounts receivable from

Carnival Games

and

BioShock

. In addition, accounts payable and accrued expenses increased due to product
releases at the end of the quarter, holiday season advertising and higher Company performance based compensation. We were also refunded $22.3 million of previously paid income taxes in 2008.
Offsetting the increase in cash was an increase in software development costs and licenses which reflects higher development budgets for upcoming products as the installed base of current generation
of hardware platforms continues to grow.

Cash
used for investing activities includes cash paid to purchase fixed assets as well as contingent consideration payments made for our prior year acquisitions, our current year acquisitions of
Rockstar New England, formerly known as Mad Doc Software, and 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion Softworks, partially offset by the sale of assets to Ditan.

In
2008, we issued 1,496,647 shares of unregistered common stock valued at $27.9 million in connection with our acquisition of 2K Czech. In March 2008, we issued 53,033 shares of our
unregistered common stock valued at $1.4 million in connection with our acquisition of Rockstar New England.

Cash
provided by financing activities increased from $25.7 million for the year ended October 31, 2007 to $77.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2008, primarily due
to net borrowings on our line of credit of $52.0 million in 2008 and an increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options in 2008.

Cash
and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by $9.1 million in 2008 as a result of foreign currency exchange movements.

International Operations

Net revenue earned outside of the United States is principally generated by our operations in Europe, Canada, Australia and Asia. For 2008 and 2007, approximately 40.7% and
31.3%, respectively, of our net revenue was earned outside of the United States. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.

Historically,
fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results. Under our Amended Credit Agreement, outstanding balances bear interest at our election of
(a) 2.00% to 2.50% above a certain base rate (8.00% at October 31, 2008), or (b) 3.25% to 3.75% above the LIBOR rate with a minimum 4.00% LIBOR Rate (7.25% at October 31,
2008), with the margin rate subject to the


achievement
of certain average liquidity levels. Changes in market rates may impact our future interest expense. For instance, if the LIBOR rate were to increase one percentage point (1.0%), our
expected annual interest expense would change by approximately $0.7 million based on our outstanding loan balance as of October 31, 2008. A decrease in the LIBOR rate would not have a
material impact on interest expense because of the 4.00% minimum LIBOR rate prescribed under our Amended Credit Agreement.

We
transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into United
States dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant quarter end. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity. For the year ended October 31,
2008, our foreign currency translation adjustment loss was approximately $42.4 million.

For
the year ended October 31, 2008, 40.7% of the Company's revenue was generated outside the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 4.1%, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 4.1%. In the opinion
of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency.

Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The financial statements and supplementary data appear in a separate section of this report following Part IV. We provide details of our valuation and qualifying
accounts in "Note 18—Supplementary Financial Information" to the consolidated financial statements. All schedules have been omitted since the information required to be submitted
has been included on the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto or has been omitted as not applicable or not required.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") were effective as
of the end of the period covered by this report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


(ii)

provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

(iii)

provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements.

Management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods is subject
to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of October 31, 2008. Our independent registered public accounting firm, E&Y, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report on
the audit of internal control over financial reporting appears on page 61 of this Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during 2008, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by
paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

(All

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. at
October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment effective November 1, 2007 and November 1, 2005, respectively.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.'s internal control over
financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated December 16, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

We
have audited Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.'s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2008, based on
the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Take-Two Interactive
Software, Inc. as of October 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2008 of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and our report dated December 16, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)

1.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," or similar pronouns) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1993. We are a leading global publisher, developer
and distributor of interactive entertainment software, hardware and accessories. Our publishing segment, which consists of Rockstar Games, 2K Games, 2K Sports and 2K Play, develops, markets and
publishes software titles for the following leading gaming and entertainment hardware platforms:

Sony

Microsoft

Nintendo

PLAYSTATION® 3

Xbox 360®

Wii™

PlayStation® 2

DS™

PSP® (PlayStation® Portable)

We
also develop and publish software titles for the PC. Our distribution segment, which primarily consists of our Jack of All Games subsidiary, distributes our products as well as third party
software, hardware and accessories to retail outlets primarily in North America.

The
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and of entities for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary as
defined in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) ("FIN 46"), "

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

." All material inter-company balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the financial statements of the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of software development costs, licenses and intangibles, valuation of
inventories, realization of deferred income taxes, the adequacy of allowances for sales returns, price concessions and doubtful accounts, accrued liabilities, the service period for deferred net
revenue, the valuation of stock-based transactions and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require us to make judgments, involve
analysis of historical and prediction of future trends, and are subject to change from period to period. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value
because of their short maturities. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At October 31, 2008 and 2007 we
had $3,199 and $3,538, respectively, of cash


on
deposit reported as a component of prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying balance sheet because its use was restricted.

We
transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant sales and purchase transactions denominated in foreign currencies. From time to time, we use forward exchange contracts to
mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency assets and liabilities, primarily cash balances and certain inter-company receivables and payables. We do not designate foreign currency
forward contracts as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

"SFAS 133". As a
result, we mark to market our foreign currency forward contracts each period and any gains and losses are recognized in net income. At October 31, 2008, we had no outstanding foreign currency
forward contracts.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Accounts Receivable

We maintain cash balances at several major financial institutions. While we attempt to limit credit exposure with any single institution, balances often exceed insurable
amounts.

If
the financial condition and operations of our customers deteriorate, our risk of collection could increase substantially. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major
retailers and distributors. Our five largest customers accounted for 40.2%, 51.1% and 49.4% of net revenue in each of the three years ended October 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. As of
October 31, 2008 and 2007, the five largest customers accounted for 39.0% and 54.4% of our gross accounts receivable, respectively. Customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of
our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 11.8% and 41.9% of such balances at October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Except for the largest customers noted above, all receivable
balances from the remaining individual customers are less than 10% of our net receivable balance. We believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant
credit risk based on past collection experience.

Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventory and make adjustments as necessary. Estimated product
returns are included in the inventory balance at their cost.

Software Development Costs and Licenses

Capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to third party software developers under development
agreements.

We
capitalize internal software development costs (including stock-based compensation, specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and
release of titles), third party production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title. Technological feasibility of a product includes the
completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation.

We
enter into agreements with third party developers that require us to make advance payments for game development and production services. In exchange for our advance payments, we receive the
exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as, in some cases, the underlying intellectual property rights. Such agreements allow us to fully recover the advance
payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software, net of any agreed upon costs. We capitalize all advance payments to developers as
software development costs. On a product-by-product basis, we reduce software development costs and record a corresponding amount of research and development expense for any
costs incurred by third party developers prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product. We typically enter into agreements with third party developers after


completing
the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense. When we contract
with third party developers, we generally select third party developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed, which often allows for the
establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle. In instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract, we monitor
the software development process and require our third party developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products.

Licenses
consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our
products. Agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property. Guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an
asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) upon execution of a licensing agreement, provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor. When significant
performance remains to be completed by the licensor, we record payments when actually paid.

Certain
licenses, especially those related to our sports products, extend over multi-year periods and encompass multiple game titles. In addition to guaranteed minimum payments, these
licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on pre-agreed unit sales thresholds.

Amortization
of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a title-by-title basis in cost of goods sold. For
capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using (1) the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or
(2) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title, whichever is greater. For capitalized licenses, amortization is calculated as a ratio of
(1) current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or (2) the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as
defined in the licensing agreement, whichever is greater.

At
each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs, licenses and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that
have not been paid, using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis. We use various measures to evaluate expected product performance and estimate future revenues for our software titles including
historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.
When management determines that the value of a title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales, capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is
made.

We
have established internal royalty programs that allow that certain of our employees participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing. Royalties earned by employees under
this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred.

Fixed Assets, net

Office equipment, furniture and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of five years. Computer equipment and
software are generally depreciated using the straight-line method over three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or seven years.
The cost of additions and betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations, in the periods incurred. When depreciable assets are retired or sold, the cost and
related allowances for depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. The carrying amounts of these assets are recorded at historical cost.


Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of purchase price paid over identified intangible and tangible net assets of acquired companies. Intangible assets consist of trademarks, intellectual
property, non-compete agreements, customer lists and acquired technology. Certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized as assets apart from goodwill.
Identified intangibles other than goodwill are generally amortized using the straight-line method over the period of expected benefit ranging from three to ten years, except for
intellectual property, which is a usage-based intangible asset that is amortized using the shorter of the useful life or expected revenue stream.

We
perform an annual test for impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or earlier if indicators of impairment exist. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using a
discounted cash flow analysis and compare such values to the respective reporting unit's carrying amount.

Long-lived Assets

We review all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including assets
to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. We compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we record an
impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. The estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at our
incremental borrowing rate or fair value, if available.

In
fiscal 2006, we incurred impairment charges recorded in operating expenses of $15,608 related to write-offs of fixed assets, trademarks and other assets for the closure of
underperforming development studios and goodwill and fixed asset impairment in connection with our 2006 goodwill impairment testing. All of such costs were recorded in our publishing segment.

Income Taxes

We recognize deferred taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect
on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than
not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized. We do not record income tax expense related to foreign withholding taxes or United States income taxes which may become payable upon the
repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States.

We
use estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions, amounts of permanent and temporary differences,
the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks. These estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur, more experience is acquired and
additional information is obtained. The impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known.

Revenue Recognition

We earn our revenue from the sale of internally developed interactive software titles and from the sale of titles developed by and/or licensed from third party developers
("Publishing revenue"). We also earn


revenue
from the sale of interactive software titles published by third parties, hardware and accessories ("Distribution revenue").

We
recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," in conjunction
with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition." Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software titles when there is (1) persuasive evidence
that an arrangement with the customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the product is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and
(4) collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms. Advances received for licensing and
exclusivity arrangements are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue.

Some
of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer. Generally, we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an
inconsequential deliverable. Accordingly, we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features. We determine whether our products contain substantial online functionality by
evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features, the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features; the significance of the online features
to the customers' anticipated overall gameplay experience, and the significance of our post sale obligations to customers. Overall, online play functionality is still an emerging area for us, and we
continue to monitor this developing functionality and its significance to our products.

Certain
of our software products include in-game advertising for third party products. Advance payments received for in-game advertising are reported on the balance sheet as
deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations, at which point we recognize the revenue, which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product.

Revenue
is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns, price concessions and other allowances. In circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price
concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine
that collection of the receivable is probable.

Allowances for Returns, Price Concessions and Other Allowances

We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of our products, we grant price concessions to
permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. Our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive
price concessions, including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.

Our
distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock
balancing and make accommodations to customers, which include credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations.

We
make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based
upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of
sell-through rates, sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers.


Significant
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We believe we can make
reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments
to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Consideration Given to Customers and Received from Vendors

We have various marketing arrangements with retailers and distributors of our products that provide for cooperative advertising and market development funds, among others,
which are generally based on single exchange transactions. Such amounts are accrued as a reduction to revenue at the later of: (1) The date at which the related revenue is recognized by the
vendor, or (2) the date at which the sales incentive is offered, except for cooperative advertising which is included in selling and marketing expense if there is a separate identifiable
benefit and the benefit's fair value can be established.

We
receive various incentives from our manufacturers, including up-front cash payments as well as rebates based on a cumulative level of purchases. Such amounts are generally accounted for
as a reduction in the price of the manufacturer's product and included as a reduction of inventory or cost of goods sold, based on (1) a ratio of current period revenue to the total revenue
expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the product or (2) an agreed upon per unit rebate, based on actual units manufactured during the period.

Advertising

We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 amounted to $101,374, $78,004 and $83,533,
respectively.

Earnings (Loss) per Share

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the same period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding and common stock equivalents, which includes shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding during the same period. The
computation for diluted number of shares excludes those unexercised stock options and warrants, which are antidilutive. For the years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, all common stock
equivalents were excluded from our computation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding because their effect would have been antidilutive due to the net loss for those periods. The number of
antidilutive common stock equivalents excluded was approximately 3,651,000, 5,624,000 and 7,208,000 for the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In
addition, for the year ended October 31, 2008, we have excluded from our diluted earnings per share calculations 900,000 shares of market based restricted stock awarded to ZelnickMedia
Corporation ("ZelnickMedia") because the issuance of such shares is subject to the achievement of certain performance obligations. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information regarding ZelnickMedia restricted stock awards.

Stock-based Compensation

We have issued stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee consultants, such as ZelnickMedia.

The
estimated fair value of service based stock option awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, generally three years. Service based restricted stock awards are valued using the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant and are amortized to expense on a straight-line
basis over their vesting period, also typically three years. Employee stock-based compensation expense is calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment is recognized at that time.

Market
based restricted stock is typically awarded to executive level employees and non-employee consultants. We estimate the value of market based awards using the Monte Carlo Simulation
method which also takes into account the probability that the market conditions of the award will be achieved. We have issued market based awards that vest based on a variety of conditions:
(1) the correlation of the return of our common stock price relative to companies in the NASDAQ Industrial Index; (2) internal profitability metrics; and (3) appreciation in the
price of our common stock. Market based awards are amortized over the estimated derived service period, which typically ranges from three to four years.

Stock-based
compensation issued to non-employees is subject to variable accounting. We remeasure the value of such awards at each balance sheet date and adjust the value of the award based
on the closing price of our common stock. Changes in the value of the award from period to period are recognized as stock-based compensation expense in our statement of operations over the vesting
period of the award, generally three years.

Because
we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on November 1, 2006, outstanding stock option awards that were not vested as of October 31, 2005 are recognized as compensation
expense in the statement of operations over the remaining requisite service period. We measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested stock-based awards based on estimated fair values and
recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest.

See
Note 15 for a full discussion of our stock-based compensation arrangements.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the applicable local currency. Accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and average prevailing exchange rates for the period for revenue and expense accounts. Adjustments resulting from translation are included in
other comprehensive income (loss). Realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur, except on inter-company balances considered to be long
term. Transaction gains and losses on inter-company balances considered to be long term are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign exchange transaction loss included in net income for
the year ended October 31, 2008 amounted to $5,097. Foreign exchange transaction gains included in net loss for the years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $1,644 and $2,176,
respectively.

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Company's items of other comprehensive income
(loss) are foreign currency translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are permanent in nature and therefore do not require tax adjustments.


Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 157,

Fair
Value Measurements

("SFAS 157"), which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior
accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (November 1, 2008 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal
years. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FAS 157-2 which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date
of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (November 1, 2009 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this
FSP. On October 10, 2008 the FASB issued FASB issued FSP FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is
Not Active

, which clarifies the application of SFAS 157, in a market that is not active. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS 157, FSP
FAS 157-2 and FSP FAS 157-3 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

("SFAS 159").
SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards, which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS 159, a company may
elect to use fair value to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities, on an instrument-by-instrument basis. If the fair value option is elected, unrealized
gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes
in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (November 1, 2008 for the Company), with earlier adoption
permitted. We did not adopt SFAS 159 prior to November 1, 2008 and do not expect it to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
June 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force's ("EITF") consensus conclusion on EITF 07-03,

Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments
for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development

. EITF 07-03 addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the
non-refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities. Under this conclusion, an entity is required to defer and
capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
EITF 07-03 is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 (November 1, 2008 for the Company), and requires
prospective application for new contracts entered into after the effective date. We do not expect that the adoption of EITF 07-03 will have a material effect on our consolidated
financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),

Business Combinations

("SFAS 141(R)"). This Statement provides greater consistency in
the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations. It requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction,
establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and requires the acquirer to disclose the nature and financial
effect of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 (November 1, 2009 for the Company) and interim periods within
those years, with earlier adoption prohibited. We are evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS 141(R) will have on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of
operations.


In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

("FSP
FAS 142-3"). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of
recognized intangible assets under SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This guidance for determining the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset applies prospectively to intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets in either an asset acquisition or business combination. FSP
FAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2008 (November 1, 2009 for the Company), and early
adoption is prohibited. We do not expect that the adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities

("FSP EITF 03-6-1"), which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.
FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before they vest will be considered participating securities and
included in the basic earnings per share calculation. The Company is assessing the impact of adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on its results of operations.

2.     RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

During the year ended October 31, 2008, Electronic Arts Inc. ("EA") extended a tender offer to our stockholders (the "Offer") to acquire all outstanding shares of
our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors, upon the advice of its financial and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Offer was inadequate and recommended that stockholders not accept it. The
Offer was extended several times through August 2008, at which time the Offer expired. Our management and Board commenced a formal process to review strategic alternatives beginning in April 2008 that
included discussions with potential interested parties. In October 2008, we announced the conclusion of our strategic review process. We incurred $11,070 of costs in 2008 related to the EA Offer and
our strategic review process which are recorded in general and administrative expenses.

3.     MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

In March 2007, we began operating under a management services agreement with ZelnickMedia (the "Management Agreement"), whereby ZelnickMedia provides us with certain
management, consulting
and executive level services. Strauss Zelnick, the President of ZelnickMedia, serves as our Executive Chairman. In addition, we have entered into employment agreements with Ben Feder and Karl Slatoff
to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, respectively. Both Mr. Feder and Mr. Slatoff are partners of ZelnickMedia. The Management Agreement expires in
October 2012 and provides for an annual management fee of $2,500 ($750 prior to the amendment that was effective as of April 1, 2008) and a maximum bonus of $2,500 per fiscal year ($750 prior
to the amendment that was effective as of April 1, 2008) based on the Company achieving certain performance thresholds. In consideration for ZelnickMedia's services under the Management
Agreement, we recorded consulting expense (a component of general and administrative expenses) of $3,674 and $649 for the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Pursuant
to the Management Agreement, we also issued stock-based compensation to ZelnickMedia. See Note 15 for a discussion of the such awards.

4.     BUSINESS REORGANIZATION AND RELATED CHARGES

We initiated a management and business reorganization plan in the second quarter of 2007, which included costs to replace our former executive management team and certain
members of our Board of Directors, and utilize the services of ZelnickMedia. In addition, we undertook a restructuring plan that centralized and eliminated certain of our business operations. As a
result, we incurred employee termination costs, relocation expenses, facility related costs (including fixed assets and lease termination costs) and professional fees.


Our
2008 reorganization expense was mainly comprised of costs to close two development studios in the third quarter of 2008. The studio closures represent the finalization of our 2007 reorganization
plan and included severance costs, relocation expenses, facility related costs (including fixed assets and lease termination costs) and professional fees.

As
of October 31, 2008, our management and business reorganization was substantially complete. The following table summarizes the activity in accrued business reorganization costs:

5.     BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND CONSOLIDATION

During the three years ended October 31, 2008, we consummated the acquisitions described below, which largely reflect our strategy to diversify our business by adding
experienced development studios, intellectual properties and talented personnel resources to our existing infrastructure. The acquisitions were not considered to be material to our consolidated
statements of operations, individually or in the aggregate. The results of operations and financial positions of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from their
respective acquisition dates forward and therefore affect comparability from period to period. During the year ended October 31, 2008, we paid contingent consideration of $3,375 for our prior
year acquisitions.

In March 2008, we acquired the assets of Rockstar New England, formerly known as Mad Doc Software LLC ("Rockstar New England"), an independent
development studio in North America and


developer
of the

Bully

franchise. Total consideration paid upon acquisition was $6,068, consisting of $3,740 in cash, 53,033 shares of our unregistered
common stock and $975 of development advances paid prior to the acquisition. The terms of the transaction also include additional contingent deferred payments of up to $15,000 payable in cash or
stock, based on meeting certain employment provisions, the release of several titles, and achievements based on sales of specific titles. The goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is
deductible for tax purposes.

In
December 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of 2K Czech, formerly known as Illusion Softworks, a.s. ("2K Czech"), the Czech Republic developer of the

Mafia

video game franchise. The
acquisition reflects our strategy to add high-value intellectual property and development studios to our
portfolio. Total consideration paid upon acquisition was $32,908, consisting primarily of 1,496,647 shares of our unregistered common stock and $4,645 of development advances paid prior to the
acquisition. The terms of the transaction also include additional contingent deferred payments in cash and stock of up to $10,000, which is expected to be allocated between purchase price and employee
compensation expense when the conditions requiring their payment are met. We are currently evaluating the opportunity to claim tax deductions for the goodwill.

In
November 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Firaxis Games, Inc., a developer of PC and strategy titles, including the

Sid Meier's
Civilization

franchise. Total consideration paid upon acquisition was $15,442 including 678,683 shares of our unregistered common stock and $4,085 of development advances paid
prior to the acquisition. We also agreed to make additional contingent deferred cash payments of up to $11,250 based on future product sales, of which approximately $10,000 will be recorded as
additional purchase price and $1,250 will be recorded as employee compensation expense when the conditions requiring their payment are met. The goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is
not deductible for tax purposes.

9.     GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

We assess goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. For the fiscal years
2008 and 2007 we did not recognize an impairment loss on goodwill. In fiscal 2006, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $6,341 related to our former Joytech subsidiary, a manufacturer and
distributor of video game accessories and peripherals, which operated within our publishing segment. The impairment charge was recorded as a component of operating expenses.

10.   CREDIT AGREEMENT

In July 2007, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo which was amended and restated in November 2007 (the "Amended Credit Agreement"). The Amended Credit Agreement
provides for borrowings of up to $140,000 and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement expires on July 3, 2012. Revolving
loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at our election of (a) 2.00% to 2.50% above a certain base rate (8.00% at October 31, 2008), or (b) 3.25% to 3.75% above the
LIBOR Rate with a minimum 4.00% LIBOR Rate (7.25% at October 31, 2008), with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels. We are also required to pay an
annual fee on the unused available balance, ranging from 0.25% to 0.75% based on amounts borrowed.

As
of October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007, we had borrowings outstanding of $70,000 and $18,000 and had $28,964 and $72,000 available for borrowings, respectively. We recorded $2,827
and $964 of interest expense and fees related to the Amended Credit Agreement for the period ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Availability
under the Amended Credit Agreement is restricted by our domestic and United Kingdom based accounts receivable and inventory balance. The Amended Credit Agreement also allows for the
issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $25,000. Outstanding letters of credit reduce availability under the revolving line of credit. We had $11,560 and $10,000 of letters of
credit outstanding at October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The
Amended Credit Agreement substantially limits us and our subsidiaries' ability to: create, incur, assume or be liable for indebtedness; dispose of assets outside the ordinary course; acquire,
merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity; create, incur or allow any lien on any of their respective properties; make investments; or pay dividends or make distributions (each
subject to certain limitations). In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest, breaches of representations and
warranties, noncompliance with covenants, acts of insolvency, default on indebtedness held by third parties and default on certain material contracts (subject to certain limitations and cure periods).
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains a requirement that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than one to one for the trailing twelve month period, if the liquidity of our domestic
operations falls below $30,000 (including available borrowings under the credit facility), based on a 30-day average. As of October 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all
covenants and requirements outlined in the Amended Credit Agreement.

Debt
issuance costs capitalized in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement totaled $2,770 and are being amortized over the five year term of the Credit Facility. Amortization related to these
costs is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

12.   LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS

Various lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations are pending involving us and certain of our subsidiaries as described below in this section. Depending on the amount
and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition to the matters
described herein, we are, or may become, involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Consumer Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

In July 2005, we received four complaints for purported class actions,
which were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, alleged purchasers of our

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

game, assert that we engaged in consumer deception and false advertising, breached an implied warranty of merchantability and were unjustly enriched as a result of our
alleged failure to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained "hidden" content. The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of
various violations of law and litigation costs. Although the Court previously granted preliminary approval of a settlement of the foregoing consumer class action lawsuits, in July 2008 the Court
refused to certify the proposed settlement class on the basis that, under controlling case law issued after the parties negotiated the settlement, the plaintiffs could no longer meet their burden of
showing that the case could proceed on the proposed class basis, regardless of whether the purpose of certification was for litigation or settlement. The plaintiffs have applied for permission to
appeal. We express no opinion as to the likelihood of permission to appeal being granted or the outcome of any such appeal, and will continue to defend this case vigorously.

City of Los Angeles Consumer Litigation.

In January 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a complaint against us in the Superior Court of the
State of California alleging violations of California law on substantially the same basis as the consumer class action regarding

Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas

. The complaint seeks injunctive and other relief. The case was removed and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. We have engaged
in settlement discussions with the City
of Los Angeles and expect that they will lead to a resolution of this matter after the resolution of such consumer class action.

Securities Class Action—Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Option Backdating.

In February and March 2006, four purported class
action complaints were filed against us and certain of our former officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The actions were consolidated, and in April
2007 the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated second amended complaint which contained


allegations
related to purported "hidden content" contained in

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

and the backdating of stock options, including the
investigation thereof conducted by the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors and the restatement of our financial statements relating thereto. This complaint was filed against us, our
former Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, our former Chairman of the Board, our Rockstar Games subsidiary, and one officer and one former officer of our Rockstar Games
subsidiary. He sought unspecified compensatory damages and costs including attorneys' fees and expenses. In April 2008, the Court dismissed, with leave to amend, all claims as to all defendants
relating to

and certain claims as to our former CEO, CFO and certain director defendants relating to the backdating of
stock options. In September 2008, the lead plaintiff filed a third amended consolidated complaint seeking to reinstate these claims. We express no opinion as to the outcome of the complaint and will
continue to defend this case vigorously.

St. Clair Derivative Action.

In January 2006, the St. Clair Shores General Employees Retirement System filed a purported
class and derivative action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and
directors. The factual allegations in this action are similar to those in the securities class action described above. The plaintiff asserts that certain defendants breached their fiduciary duty by
selling their stock while in possession of certain material non-public information and that we violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9
thereunder by failing to disclose material facts in our 2003, 2004 and 2005 proxy statements in which we solicited approval to increase share availability under our 2002 Stock Option Plan. The
plaintiff seeks the return of all profits from the alleged insider trading conducted by the individual defendants who sold our stock, unspecified compensatory damages with interest and its costs in
the action. In March 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the complaint based on, among other things, the Committee's conclusion that "future pursuit of this action is not in the
best interests of Take-Two or its shareholders." In August 2007, the plaintiff filed an Amended Derivative and Class Action Complaint alleging, among other things, that defendants breached
their fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of proxy statements from 2001 through 2005. In September 2007, the Special Litigation Committee moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint or to
consolidate certain of its claims with the securities class action. In July 2008, the Court dismissed all claims against us and all claims against all defendants that arose out of the plaintiff's
derivative claims. The Court expressly did not determine whether the remaining claims, which are related to the proxy statements, would entitle the putative class to monetary damages. We intend to
continue to vigorously defend against the remainder of the plaintiff's claims.

Derivative Action—Option Backdating.

In July and August 2006, shareholders Richard Lasky and Raeda Karadsheh filed purported
derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us, as nominal defendant, and certain of our directors and certain former officers and directors. These
actions were consolidated in November 2006 and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in January 2007, which focused exclusively on our historical stock option granting practices, alleging
violations of federal and state law, including breaches of fiduciary duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaints sought unspecified
damages against all of the individual defendants, reimbursement from certain of the defendants of bonuses or other incentive or equity-based compensation paid to them, equitable and other relief
relating to the proceeds from certain of the defendants' alleged improper trading activity in our stock, adoption of certain corporate governance proposals and recovery of litigation costs. These
matters were referred to the Special Litigation Committee, which moved to dismiss certain parties from the litigation and to have any claims against the remaining parties be assigned to us for
disposition by our management and Board of Directors. The parties are awaiting a decision by the Court.

Strickland et al. Personal Injury Action.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of the Estates of Arnold Strickland, James Crump
and Ace Mealer brought an action in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against us, Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc., Sony Corporation of America,


Wal-Mart,
GameStop and Devin Moore, alleging under Alabama's manufacturers' liability and wrongful death statutes, that our video games resulted in "copycat violence" that caused the
deaths of Messrs. Strickland, Crump and Mealer by Mr. Moore. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants in excess of $600,000. In April 2006, the
plaintiffs amended the complaint to add a claim for civil conspiracy. Our motion to dismiss that claim is pending. At our request, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on October 30, 2008 to
consider the exclusion of certain expert testimony and a second hearing was held on December 18, 2008. There currently is no scheduling order in effect. We believe that the claims are without
merit and that this action is similar to lawsuits brought and uniformly dismissed by courts in other jurisdictions.

Stockholder Actions.

In March 2008, Patrick Solomon, a stockholder, filed a purported class action complaint in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware against us and certain of our officers and directors. The plaintiff contends that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allegedly refusing to
explore premium offers by Electronic Arts Inc. to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, enacting a bylaw amendment allegedly designed to entrench the current board by
preventing stockholders from nominating and electing alternative directors, agreeing to an amendment to a management agreement with ZelnickMedia and issuing a proxy statement for the 2008 annual
meeting of stockholders that allegedly contained misleading and incomplete information. The complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, rescissory and other equitable relief and
damages. After certain voluntary actions were taken by the Company, the plaintiff agreed to withdraw his motion for preliminary injunctive relief, and the annual meeting went forward without
difficulty (and without any stockholders nominating directors or proposing business). Discovery on the remaining claims is ongoing. We believe the remaining claims lack merit, and intend to defend
vigorously against them.

In
April 2008, St. Clair Shores General Employees Retirement System, a stockholder, filed a purported derivative action on behalf of the Company in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware against our directors and ZelnickMedia. The allegations are essentially the same as those in the Solomon stockholder action, above, with an additional complaint about the "poison pill"
adopted by our board in March 2008, and an additional claim against ZelnickMedia for aiding and abetting the directors' alleged breach of fiduciary duty. Because the action was duplicative, the
plaintiff agreed to stay all proceedings in the case in favor of the Solomon case. We believe the claims lack merit, and intend to defend vigorously against them. Also in April 2008, Michael Maulano,
an alleged stockholder, filed a purported class action in New York state court, New York County, against us and our directors.

We
intend to vigorously defend all of the above matters and, with respect to the derivative actions, we have been advised that the individual defendants will vigorously defend such actions. However,
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters and, if determined adversely to us, such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in the imposition of significant judgments,
fines, penalties and/or injunctive relief, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Grand Jury Subpoenas.

In 2006, we received grand jury subpoenas issued by the District Attorney of the County of New York requesting
production of documents covering various periods beginning on January 1, 1997, including those relating to, among other things: the so-called "Hot Coffee" scenes in

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

;
the work of our Board of Directors, all board committees and the Special Litigation Committee; certain acquisitions
entered into by us; billing and payment records relating to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the termination of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our auditors; communications to financial
analysts and stockholders about acquisitions and financial results; compensation and human resources documents of certain of our directors and employees and former directors and employees; stock-based
compensation; the SEC's July 2006 inquiry; legal services performed for employees; corporate credit card and expense records of certain individuals; the SEC bar of our former Chief Executive Officer,
Ryan Brant; the resolution to amend our Incentive Stock Plan; and ethics, securities, and conflict of interest policies and questionnaires. Over time, the District Attorney's


investigation
focused on options backdating. We have fully cooperated and provided the documents and information called for by the subpoenas.

SEC Investigation.

In July 2006, we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting an informal non-public investigation of
certain stock option grants made from January 1997 to 2006 and in April 2007 we received notice from the SEC that it was conducting a formal investigation of such stock option grants. As a result of
the Special Litigation Committee's internal review of our option grants, in February 2007 we restated our financial statements for prior periods in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. In August 2007, we received a "Wells" notice from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement of the SEC informing us of its intention to request
authority to file charges, and to seek a civil monetary penalty in connection with its
investigation. We submitted a response to the Staff's notice in September 2007, urging that no charges should be brought against us. We have continued to cooperate with the Staff and we continue to
expect to resolve this investigation by means of a settlement rather than a contested litigation of charges.

Tax Inquiries.

We have been in contact with and have received requests for information from several taxing authorities for records relating
to the grant and exercise of options and tax deductions taken by us from October 2000 to October 2006.

Licensing and Marketing Agreements:

Our licensing commitments primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights
for use of their trademarks, copyrights, technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products. As of October 31, 2008, $216 of our guaranteed minimum licensing
and marketing commitments were recorded in our consolidated balance sheet because the licensor did not have any significant performance obligation to us. Licensing and marketing commitments expire at
various times through October 2012 and primarily reflect our agreements with major sports leagues and players' associations. Certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions
that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon software release dates.

Software Development Agreements:

We make payments to third party software developers that include contractual advances and royalties under
several software development agreements that expire at various times through November 2010. Our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by third party
software developers.

Lease Commitments:

Our office and warehouse facilities are occupied under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various
times through June 2015. We also lease certain furniture, equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable leases expiring through March 2013. Some of the leases have fixed rent increases
and also include inducements to enter into the lease. The effect of such amounts are deferred


and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term. Rent expense amounted to $15,924, $16,459 and $16,658 for the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Distribution Services:

We entered into an Inventory Management Services Agreement to outsource non-core elements (shipping,
receiving, warehouse management and related functions) of our distribution business which expires in September 2013.

Contingent Consideration:

Part of our business acquisition strategy has been to make a portion of the purchase price of certain
acquisitions dependent on product delivery or future product sales. The amounts and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable. See Note 5 for a discussion of our
contingent commitments related to our business acquisitions.

Employee savings plan:

We maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan and trust. Our 401(k) plan is offered to all eligible employees and
participants may make voluntary contributions. We began matching a portion of the contributions in July 2002. The matching contribution expense incurred by us during the years ended October 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 was $2,251, $1,869 and $1,989, respectively.

Income Taxes:

At October 31, 2008, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $26,399 for which we are unable to make a reasonable
reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities. Thus, these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table. See
Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The valuation allowance for deferred taxes is primarily attributable to net operating losses for which no benefit is provided due to uncertainty with respect to
their realization. In addition, during the year ended October 31, 2008, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $143 and a corresponding reduction to additional
paid-in-capital for the cancellation of certain stock options.


At
October 31, 2008, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward totaling $173,501, which $79,959 is subject to limitation by the Internal Revenue Service, and that will begin to
expire in fiscal 2026 and foreign net operating losses of $17,777 that may be carried forward indefinitely.

The
total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was approximately $229,800 and $152,000 for the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. It is our intention to
reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance. Accordingly, no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States
income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends.

We
are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax
return positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable assessments of additional taxes. Additionally, we believe that any assessments in excess
of the amounts provided for will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements.

On
November 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(FIN 48). The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was $1,075 and was recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in our consolidated
balance sheet.

A
year-over-year reconciliation of our liability for gross uncertain tax positions is as follows:

$

18,412

We
recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations. The gross amount of interest and penalties accrued
as of October 31, 2008 was approximately $7,987.

Approximately
$26,399 of the consolidated worldwide liability for unrecognized tax benefits recorded in our balance sheet would affect our effective tax rate if recognized.

U.S.
federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for years from fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2006. In addition, tax authorities in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions are examining our returns affecting unrecognized tax benefits. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to October 31, 2009. If any of these tax audit
settlements do occur within that period, the company would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. Until formal resolutions are reached between the company and the
tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. We are no longer subject to audit for U.S. federal
and state income tax returns for periods prior to fiscal 2000. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to
fiscal 2001.

We
believe that we have provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to our tax audits and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, cash flows or results of operations. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes.


15.   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Our stock-based compensation plans are broad-based, long-term retention programs intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and
employee interests. For similar reasons, we also granted non-employee equity awards, which are subject to variable accounting, to ZelnickMedia in connection with their contract to provide
executive management services to us. We began replacing stock option awards with restricted stock awards in 2007. We issue shares to employees on the date the restricted stock is granted and therefore
shares granted have voting rights and are considered issued and outstanding.

In
April 2008, our stockholders approved an increase to the number of shares available for grant under the Incentive Stock Plan from 4,500,000 to 6,500,000. The Incentive Stock Plan is administered by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and allows for awards of restricted stock, deferred stock and other stock-based awards of our common stock to employees and
non-employees. As of October 31, 2008, there were approximately 1,090,000 shares available for issuance under the Incentive Stock Plan.

In
June 2002, our stockholders approved our 2002 Stock Option Plan, as previously adopted by our Board of Directors (the "2002 Plan"), pursuant to which officers, directors, employees and consultants
may receive stock options to purchase shares of our common stock. In June 2005, our stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate amount of shares issuable under the 2002 Plan from 9,000,000
shares to 11,000,000 shares. As of October 31, 2008, there were approximately 1,150,000 shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan.

In
January 1997, our stockholders approved our 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, as previously adopted by our Board of Directors (the "1997 Plan"), pursuant to which officers, directors, employees
and consultants may receive options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares (9,750,000 shares after stock split in April 2005) of our common stock. As of October 31, 2008, there were
no shares of common stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan.

Subject
to the provisions of the plans, the Board of Directors or any Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, has the authority to determine the individuals to whom the stock options or other
awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each option or other award, the option price, the type of option, the option period, restrictions, if any, on the exercise of the option
or
other award, the terms for the payment of the option price and other terms and conditions of the option or other award.

During
the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, we recorded $13,481 and $1,283 of stock-based compensation expense for non-employee awards, respectively. We did not record any
stock-based compensation expense for non-employee awards for the year ended 2006.


We
capitalize and amortize stock-based compensation awards in accordance with our software development cost accounting policy.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards granted to employees under our equity incentive plans generally vest over 3 years from the date of grant. Certain restricted stock awards granted
to key officers, senior-level employees, and key employees in 2008 vest based on market conditions, primarily related to the performance of the price of our common stock and internal profitability
metrics.

On
June 13, 2008, pursuant to an amendment to our Management Agreement, we granted 600,000 shares of restricted stock to ZelnickMedia that vest annually over a three year period and 900,000
shares of market based restricted stock that vest over a four year period through 2012, provided that the price of our common stock outperforms 75% of the companies in the NASDAQ Industrial Index. For
the year ended October 31, 2008, we recorded $2,227 of stock-based compensation (a component of general and administrative expenses) related to these grants of restricted stock.

We
measure the fair value of our market based awards to employees and non-employees using the Monte Carlo Simulation method, which takes into account assumptions such as the expected
volatility on our common stock, the risk-free interest rate based on the contractual term of the award, expected dividend yield, vesting schedule and the probability that the market
conditions of the award will be achieved.

The
estimated value of market based restricted stock awards granted to employees and ZelnickMedia during the year ended October 31, 2008 was $16.37 per share and $9.38 per share, respectively.
The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation method:

As

recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period, or capitalized as software development costs.


Stock Options

As of October 31, 2008 and 2007, there were outstanding stock options granted under our stock option plans to purchase in the aggregate 4,347,000 and 5,818,000 shares of
our common stock, respectively, vesting at various times from 2008 to 2010 and expiring at various times from 2008 to 2017. Options granted generally vest over a period of three to four years and
expire within a period of five to ten years.

As
of October 31, 2007, there were non-plan stock options outstanding for an aggregate of 96,000 shares of our common stock. There were no non-plan stock options
outstanding at October 31, 2008.

Pursuant
to the Management Agreement, in August 2007, we issued stock options to ZelnickMedia to acquire 2,009,075 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $14.74 per share, which vest over
36 months and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Each month, we remeasure the fair value of the unvested portion of such options and record compensation expense for the difference
between total earned compensation at the end of the period, and total earned compensation at the beginning of the period. As a result, changes in the price of our common stock impacts compensation
expense or benefit recognized from period to period. For the years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007, we recorded $11,254
and $1,283, respectively, of stock-based compensation (a component of general and administrative expenses) related to this option grant.

As
of October 31, 2008, there was no aggregate intrinsic value related to options outstanding or exercisable and the total future unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures,
related to outstanding unvested options was approximately $17,253, which will be recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting periods, or
capitalized as software development costs. At October 31, 2008, the weighted average exercise price of stock options expected to vest was $16.10.

The
fair value of our stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires the input of assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that
will usually have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price, the current market price, the risk free rate and
expected exercise term. The following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model to value stock option grants for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and
remeasure variable awards in 2008:

For
the years ended October 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we estimated stock price volatility of all stock-based compensation awards using a combination of historical volatility and implied
volatility for publicly traded options on our common stock. In addition, stock-based compensation expense is calculated based on the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest, and
therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Our estimate of expected forfeitures is based on our historical annual forfeiture rate of 5%. The estimated forfeiture rate, which is evaluated
each balance sheet date throughout the life of the award, provides a time-based adjustment of forfeited shares. The estimated forfeiture rate is reassessed at each balance sheet date and
may change based on new facts and circumstances.

16.   SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We are a publisher and distributor of interactive software games designed for personal computers, video game consoles and handheld platforms. Revenue earned by our publishing
segment is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles, software titles developed on our behalf by third parties and the sale of certain video game accessories and
peripherals. Revenue earned by our distribution segment is derived from the sale of third party software titles, accessories and hardware.

Our
Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). We are centrally managed and the CODM primarily uses consolidated financial information supplemented by sales information by
product category, major product title and platform for making operational decisions and assessing financial performance.

Our
CODM is presented with financial information that contains information that separately identifies our publishing and distribution operations, including gross margin information. Accordingly, we
consider our publishing and distribution businesses to be distinct reportable segments.


Our operating segments do not record inter-segment revenue and therefore none has been reported. We do not allocate operating expenses, interest and other income, interest expense or income taxes to
operating segments. Our accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

For
the years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, we reclassified foreign exchange gain (loss) from general and administrative expense to interest and other (expense) income, net to conform to the
current year presentation for comparative purposes.

In
2007, we sold substantially all of the assets, primarily inventory and accounts receivable, of our wholly-owned Joytech video game accessories subsidiary, formerly a component of our publishing
segment, to Mad Catz Interactive, Inc. for approximately $3,575 in cash and notes receivable resulting in a loss on sale


of
$3,080. The disposition of Joytech did not involve a significant amount of assets or materially impact our operating results.

Also,
in 2007, we recognized a loss of $1,389 when we deconsolidated the net assets of Blue Castle Games, Inc. ("Blue Castle"), which was previously accounted for, in accordance with
FIN 46(R), as a wholly-owned subsidiary and considered to be a variable interest entity. Blue Castle continues to develop certain of our sports titles; however, we are no longer considered to
be the primary beneficiary of Blue Castle's future profits or losses.
