Overview

We are a leading global publisher of interactive software games designed for personal computers, and video game consoles and handheld platforms manufactured by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. We have pursued a growth strategy by capitalizing on the widespread market acceptance of video game consoles, as well as the growing popularity of innovative action games that appeal to mature audiences. We have also recently diversified our product offerings by focusing on significant growth opportunities in the market for sports and strategy titles.

Our Rockstar Games publishing label continues to successfully create new, proprietary brands and sequels to existing brands with broad consumer appeal.

Grand Theft

Auto: San Andreas

, a sequel in the blockbuster

Grand Theft Auto

® franchise, was a top selling video game across multiple platforms with sales through December 2005 in excess of 7.0 million units in North America according to NPD Funworld® and NPD Canada®. In fiscal 2005, Rockstar released

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

for Sony’s PlayStation® 2, Microsoft’s Xbox® and Sony’s PlayStation Portable (PSP™);

The Warriors

, a title based on Paramount Pictures’ classic 1979 gang drama, for the PlayStation 2 and
Xbox; and

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for the PSP.

We recently established our 2K Games and 2K Sports publishing labels. During fiscal 2005, 2K Sports made strategic acquisitions of leading sports game development studios and entered into license agreements with major sports leagues to develop sports titles. 2K Games made strategic acquisitions of game development studios and entered into license agreements for several popular entertainment properties, acquired well-known intellectual property rights and entered into distribution and publishing arrangements for major action and strategy PC titles. 2K Games and 2K Sports released more than 20 titles across multiple platforms in fiscal 2005, including

,

NHL 2K6, Top Spin, World Poker Tour

,

The information on our website is not part of this report. Our Internet address is www.take2games.com.

Diversification

We made several acquisitions in fiscal 2005 to diversify our business. In January 2005, we acquired SEGA Corporation’s California-based development studio Visual Concepts Entertainment (“Visual Concepts”) and its wholly-owned studio, Kush Games (“Kush”). Visual Concepts is the marketer and developer of the critically acclaimed 2K series of sports video games.

In June 2005, we acquired Gaia Capital Group (“Gaia”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, developers of sports and action titles for console and handheld platforms. In August 2005, we acquired Irrational Studios, developers of strategy games for the PC and console platforms with development teams based in the United States and Australia.

In fiscal 2005, we also acquired licenses and rights to popular entertainment properties, including rights to the multi-million unit selling

Civilization

franchise, as well as sports licenses, including long-term, third-party exclusive licensing relationships with Major League Baseball Properties, the Major League Baseball Players Association and Major League Baseball Advanced Media.

In fiscal 2005, we entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with Sony Pictures to publish and distribute a video game based on “The Da Vinci Code” feature film, which is expected to be available in May 2006 to coincide with the film’s release.

Also, in November 2005, we acquired Firaxis Games™ (“Firaxis”), one of the world's premier game development studios. Firaxis is known for developing award-winning, top-rated games with mass consumer appeal, including

Sid Meier's Pirates!

and the blockbuster

Civilization

franchise.

Industry Overview

Expanding gamer demographics has
    driven demand for interactive entertainment software in recent years, with
    video games becoming a mainstream entertainment choice for a maturing, technologically
    sophisticated audience. According to the Entertainment Software Association,
    an estimated 50% of all Americans play PC and video games, and the average
    age of game players is 30 years old. According to the International Development
    Group, worldwide sales of PC, console and handheld games (excluding wireless
applications) in 2004 reached $14.0 billion.

The video game industry is currently undergoing a transition due to the introduction of next-generation hardware platforms and new software for these platforms. In 2005, Sony introduced the PSP, a new handheld gaming system, followed by Microsoft’s release of the Xbox 360, a next-generation console platform. Sony is expected to introduce the PlayStation 3, and Nintendo is planning the launch of the Revolution console system in 2006. During this transition to next-generation hardware platforms, our operating results may become more volatile and more difficult to predict.  See “Risk Factors.”

We develop and publish products for all major platforms and plan to release games on each new platform at or near the launch of these platforms. We anticipate an expanding market for interactive entertainment software, as more powerful computing capabilities, increasingly realistic graphics, backwards compatibility of software, broadband connectivity, greater online functionality and expanded artificial intelligence capabilities of the new platforms create new consumer awareness and demand for this compelling entertainment medium.

The Entertainment Software Rating Board (“ESRB”), through its ratings system, requires game publishers to provide consumers with information relating to graphic violence, profanity or sexually


Back to Index

explicit material contained in software titles. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns, and various governmental bodies have proposed regulation aimed at our industry to prohibit the sale of software containing such material to minors. Additionally, retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material that they deem inappropriate for their businesses.  Many of our Rockstar titles have received an “M” rating (age 17 and over).  If retailers decline to sell our
“M” rated products or if our “M” rated products are re-rated “AO” (age 18 and over), we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles, which in the case of our best selling

Grand Theft Auto

titles could seriously hurt our business. See “Risk Factors.”

Fiscal 2005 Product Launches

We publish products in the action, racing, strategy, sports and simulation genres. During fiscal 2005, we published 14 new internally developed titles and 28 new titles developed by third parties. Of these titles, 3 internally developed titles each sold more than one million units across all platforms, and 3 internally developed and 2 externally developed titles each sold more than 500,000 units across all platforms.

In fiscal 2005,

Grand Theft Auto

products accounted for approximately 38.1% of our revenues, with

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC accounting for 25.6%, 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, of our revenues, and

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for the PSP accounting for 3.0% of our revenues.

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PSP accounted for 4.4%, 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, of our revenues for fiscal 2005, and

The Warriors

for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox accounted for 2.1% and 1.0%, respectively, of our revenues for the year. No other product accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year.

Our frontline products generally sell at retail prices ranging from $39.99 to $59.99 in North America. Products that are designated Sony’s Greatest Hits and Microsoft’s Platinum Hits sell for $19.99. We currently offer our sports titles at retail prices ranging from $14.99 to $59.99, and we position our value-priced product offerings at a retail price of $9.99. We include online capability features in certain of our PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 titles, which permits users to play against one another on the Internet. Internet game play is hosted by third-party companies.

We have established a portfolio of successful proprietary software content. We own all of the intellectual property rights associated with the following brands:

Grand Theft Auto; Midnight Club; Civilization; Manhunt; Red Dead Revolver; Max Payne; Smuggler’s Run; Oni; Myth; Spec Ops; Top Spin; Amped; Links; Railroad Tycoon; Tropico; Army Men; School

Tycoon and Xcom

    exclusive licensing relationships with Major League Baseball Properties (MLBP),
    the
    Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and Major League Baseball

Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”

We expect to continue to actively pursue selective acquisitions of property rights that we believe will enhance our growth prospects.

2K Sports.

In
    fiscal 2005, 2K Sports significantly expanded its internal development capabilities
    through the acquisition of Visual Concepts and Kush Games, the developers
    of the

Major League Baseball 2K

series

, NBA 2K

series,

NHL
    2K

series

and

College Hoops 2K

series; and

Gaia,
    the current developer of the

Top Spin

series. These new studios, together
    with Indie, the developer of the

Amped

series and

Links

, and
    Venom Games, the developer of  boxing games,

Rocky

and

Rocky:
    Legends

, develop most of our sports titles

.

Global Star.

While the majority of our Global Star titles are developed by third-party developers, we also develop software titles for our Global Star label through our internal development studio Cat Daddy Games, the developer of

Splat Magazine Renegade Paintball

and

Mall Tycoon 3

.

We believe the combination of our newly acquired development studios with our existing teams will continue to result in the development of innovative and creative games with mass market appeal.

Research & Development.

As
    of October 31, 2005, we had a research and development staff of 1,140 employees
    with the technical capabilities to develop and localize software titles for
    all major hardware platforms and the PC in all major territories. Localization
    entails translating game text into foreign languages and making other changes
    appropriate to the territory.

For fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, research and development expenses relating to our software titles were $73.2 million, $43.3 million and $25.1 million, respectively. Additionally, for these years, we capitalized software development costs of $60.3 million, $26.0 million and $15.9 million, respectively.

External Product Development.

Certain of our titles are developed by third parties. Agreements with developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make advance royalty payments, pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions. Royalty advances for software titles are recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers.

Our agreements with developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making advance payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied. We monitor the level of advances in light of expected sales for the related titles and write off unrecoverable advances to cost of sales in the period in which we determine the advance will not be fully recovered. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”

The development cycle for new console, handheld and PC titles ranges from twelve to thirty-six months. After initial development of a product, it may take between nine to twelve months to develop the product for other hardware platforms. The cost to develop a frontline product generally ranges from $5 million to $20 million. We expect that development costs will continue to increase for next-generation platforms.

Arrangements with Platform Manufacturers

We have entered into license agreements with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo to develop and publish software in North America and Europe for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PSP, Xbox, Xbox 360, Game Boy Advance and GameCube. We are not required to obtain any licenses to develop titles for the PC.

Sony.

In May 2000, we entered into a Licensed Publisher Agreement with Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. Under the terms of the agreement, Sony granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the PlayStation 2 in North America. The agreement requires us to submit products to Sony for its approval. The agreement provides for Sony to be the exclusive manufacturer of our products for the PlayStation 2 and for us to pay royalties to Sony based on the number of units manufactured.

The agreement with Sony is automatically renewable for successive one-year terms, unless terminated by Sony in the event of a breach by us or our bankruptcy or insolvency. Sony may also terminate the agreement on a title-by-title basis. Upon expiration or termination of this agreement, we have certain


Back to Index

rights to sell off existing inventories. We also entered into a similar agreement with Sony for the PlayStation 2 covering European territories and Australia.

In September 2004, we entered into a three-year agreement with Sony pursuant to which Sony granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the PSP in North America. We also signed a similar agreement with Sony for the PSP covering European territories and Australia. We entered into a four-year Licensed Publisher Agreement with Sony in April 2004 under which Sony granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for the PlayStation in North America. We also entered into a similar agreement with Sony for PlayStation covering European territories and Australia.

Microsoft

.

Under a Publisher License Agreement dated December 2000, as amended, Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for Microsoft’s Xbox in territories to be determined on a title-by-title basis. The agreement requires us to submit products to Microsoft for its approval and for us to make royalty payments to Microsoft based on the number of units manufactured. Products for the Xbox must be manufactured by pre-approved manufacturers. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach and expires in November 2007. The agreement is automatically renewable for a single renewal term of one year, unless either party gives the
other party prior notice of non-renewal. Microsoft also has the right to terminate on a title-by-title basis. Upon expiration or termination of the agreement, we have certain rights to sell off existing inventories.

In November 2005, we entered into a Publisher License Agreement with Microsoft whereby Microsoft granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software titles for Microsoft’s Xbox 360 in territories to be determined on a title-by-title basis. The Agreement is similar in terms to the December 2000 agreement and expires three years from November 22, 2005, the date the Xbox 360 was commercially released by Microsoft in the United States. The agreement is automatically renewable for successive one-year terms, unless either party gives the other party prior notice of non-renewal.

Nintendo

.

We entered into a Confidential License Agreement with Nintendo that expires in December 2007. Under the agreement, Nintendo granted us the right and license to develop, market, publish and distribute software for Nintendo’s GameCube in the western hemisphere. The agreement requires us to submit products to Nintendo for its approval. The agreement also provides for Nintendo to be the exclusive manufacturer of our products and for us to make royalty payments to Nintendo based on the number of units manufactured. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a breach and may be terminated by Nintendo in the event of our bankruptcy. Upon termination of all of our agreements with Nintendo, we have
certain rights to sell off existing inventories. We also entered into a similar three-year agreement with Nintendo for GameCube covering European territories.

We also entered into an agreement with Nintendo that expires in July 2007, granting us the right and license to develop software for Nintendo’s Game Boy Advance in the western hemisphere. We entered into a similar agreement with Nintendo for European territories.

Sales and Marketing

We sell software titles to retail
    outlets in North America and Europe through direct relationships with large
    retail customers and third-party distributors. Our customers in North America
include Best Buy, Blockbuster, Circuit City, GameStop, Target, Toys “R” Us,
Wal-Mart and other leading mass merchandisers; video, electronic and toy stores;
national and regional drug stores; supermarket and discount store chains; and
specialty retailers. Our European customers include Carrefour, Dixons, Karstadt,
and Media Saturn. We have sales and marketing operations in Australia, Austria,
Canada, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Japan and
the United Kingdom.

Sales to our five largest customers in fiscal 2005 accounted for approximately 40.7% of our revenues, with Wal-Mart accounting for 14.9% of our revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for this year.


Back to Index

Our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and broaden distribution of our titles, promote brand name recognition, assist retailers and properly position, package and merchandise our titles. We market titles by implementing public relations campaigns, using print and online advertising, television, radio spots and outdoor advertising. We incurred selling and marketing costs of $157.7 million in fiscal 2005. We label and market our products in strict accordance with ESRB principles and guidelines.

We continue to actively pursue relationships with participants in the music and entertainment industries. We believe that the shared demographics between various media and some of the software titles marketed by our publishing labels provide excellent cross-promotional opportunities.

Max

Payne, Midnight Club 2,

Red Dead Revolver

and

Conflict: Desert Storm

have been designated Microsoft’s Platinum Hits Program titles. To qualify for these programs under our agreements with hardware manufacturers, our products had to satisfy certain shelf life and sales requirements. In connection with these programs, we receive manufacturing discounts from
Sony and Microsoft. Nintendo has also established a Player’s Choice Program for the Nintendo GameCube.

We seek to stimulate continued sales
    and maximize profit potential by reducing the wholesale prices of our products
    to retailers at various times during the life of a product. Price concessions
    may occur at any time in a product’s life cycle, but typically occur
    six to nine months after a product’s initial launch. In fiscal 2005
    and 2004, price concessions to retailers amounted to $30.4 million and $52.8
    million, respectively, and are often related to products designated as a
    Greatest or Platinum Hits Program title offered by Sony and Microsoft. In
    certain
    international markets, we provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product
    sales.

We also employ various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness, including in-store promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail, co-operative advertising, as well as attendance at trade shows. We employ separate sales forces for our publishing and distribution operations. As of October 31, 2005, we had a sales and marketing staff of 238 persons.

Distribution

We distribute our own titles as well as third-party software, hardware and accessories in North America through our Jack of All Games subsidiary. We distribute three major categories of third-party console and handheld products, consisting principally of newly released and popular software titles, budget and catalog software titles, and hardware.

We procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand, as well as pre-orders from retailers. We periodically enter into agreements with our suppliers that provide exclusive distribution rights to certain products. We carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders. We utilize electronic data interchange with many of our retailers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments.

Our Jack of All Games subsidiary maintains warehouse facilities and sales offices in Ohio and Toronto, Canada. Products arrive at our warehouses to be picked, packed and shipped to customers. We generally ship products by common carrier. Backlog is not material to our business as we generally ship products within seven days of receipt of orders.

Jack of All Games seeks to capitalize on the growing installed base of hardware and the proliferation of software titles and outlets to purchase software. It has established a strong presence in the budget segment of the business due to its expanding portfolio of value-priced products and its expertise in

selling these titles. Jack of All Games continues to leverage this strategy by serving as the distributor of our value-priced publishing products.

Manufacturing

Sony and Nintendo are the sole manufacturers of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms. We begin the manufacturing process for our published titles by placing a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with Sony or Nintendo and utilizing our line of credit with the manufacturer. We then send software code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer, together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs for approval, defect testing and manufacture. Games manufactured by Sony and Nintendo are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order. The same procedure applies to games for the Xbox and Xbox 360, although Xbox and Xbox
360 games must be manufactured by manufacturers pre-approved by Microsoft.

Production of PC software includes CD-ROM pressing, assembly of components, printing of packaging and user manuals and shipping of finished goods, which is performed by third-party vendors in accordance with our specifications, and, to a limited extent, by us. We believe that there are alternative sources for these services that could be obtained without delay. We send software code and a prototype of a title, together with related artwork, user instructions, warranty information, brochures and packaging designs to the manufacturers. Games are generally shipped within two weeks of receipt of our manufacturing order.

To date, we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our titles or material delays due to manufacturing defects. Our software titles carry a 90-day limited warranty.

Competition

In our publishing business, we compete both for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms. Each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns, particularly for prime-time television spots. These companies may also increase their own software development efforts or focus on developing software products for third-party platforms.

We also compete with domestic companies such as Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ, Midway Games and Atari and international companies such as SEGA, Vivendi, Ubi Soft, SCi Entertainment, Capcom, Konami and Namco. As our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing budgets for development and marketing, the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties. Competition in the entertainment software
industry is based on product quality and features, brand name recognition, access to distribution channels, effectiveness of marketing and price.

Retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources, and competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain current sales levels of our titles. Competitors with more extensive lines and popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve the levels of support and shelf space that such competitors receive. Similarly, as competition for popular properties increases, our cost of acquiring licenses for such properties is likely to
increase, possibly resulting in reduced margins. Prolonged price competition, increased licensing costs or reduced operating margins would cause our profits to decrease significantly.

Competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sell-through of our


Back to Index

titles at retail stores. Our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures, television and audio and video products featuring similar themes, online computer programs and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

In our distribution business, we compete with large national companies as well as smaller regional distributors. We also compete with the efforts of the major entertainment software companies that distribute directly to retailers or over the Internet. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, and are able to carry larger inventories, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and provide more comprehensive product selection than we can.

Intellectual Property

We develop proprietary software titles and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software titles developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Although we generally do not hold any patents, we obtain trademark and copyright registrations for our products.

Interactive entertainment software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our titles to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy operations have proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of software over the Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software, piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability.

As the amount of interactive entertainment software in the market increases and the functionality of this software further overlaps, we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the copyrights or patents of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our titles and the titles and technologies of third-party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relationships do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur. Any claims
of infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend.

International Operations

Sales in international markets, principally in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues. For fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, sales in international markets accounted for approximately 32.0%, 27.5% and 27.9%, respectively, of our net revenues. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results. See Note 20 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Employees

As of October 31, 2005, we had 2,002 full-time employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with employees to be good.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

We anticipate that we will incur a net loss for the quarter ending January 31, 2006, and we may incur future net losses.

Although we have achieved increasing levels of revenue and have generated profits in each of our last three fiscal years, we anticipate that we will incur a net loss for the quarter ending January 31, 2006 primarily as a result of a weak retail environment during the holiday season. We expect to incur increased levels of expenses associated with significant product development and licensing commitments over the next year in connection with the diversification of our product offerings. We may not generate sufficient levels of revenues to offset these increased costs, and we may incur losses in future periods. Continued losses could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

The market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles. Delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

The market for our titles is characterized by short product life cycles and frequent introductions of new products. New products may not achieve significant market acceptance or generate sufficient sales to permit us to recover development, manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products. The life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations. We have experienced delays in product releases and in fiscal 2005 our revenues were negatively impacted by product returns due to the re-rating by the ESRB of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

from “M” (age 17 and older) to “AO” (age 18 and older). Such delays and disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, if we release a limited number of new products during any period, the failure of one or more of such products to achieve market acceptance could result in lower than anticipated revenues and significant operating losses.

Rapidly changing technology and hardware cycles could adversely affect our operations and our ability to forecast our operating results.

The interactive entertainment industry is cyclical and is associated with rapidly changing technology. Microsoft introduced its next generation hardware platform into the marketplace in November 2005, and we expect that Sony and Nintendo will introduce their respective next generation hardware platforms in 2006. As a result, we anticipate that as these newer and more advanced hardware platforms achieve market acceptance, consumer demand for software for older platforms will decline. During the transition to next generation platforms, we expect to continue to devote significant development resources on products designed for current generation platforms, including Sony’s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft’s Xbox. Consumers may elect to defer
purchases of game software for these platforms until newer platforms become available. If consumer demand for these platforms declines generally or as a result of a next generation platform transition or if we are required to reduce prices for our current generation titles sooner than anticipated, we may experience lower than expected sales or losses from products designed for older platforms.

During the transition to next generation platforms, we also expect to devote significant development resources on products designed for next generation hardware platforms, initially for the Xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from Microsoft. Our ultimate success will depend on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will achieve widespread consumer acceptance. The time, resources and costs associated with the development of next generation software have increased substantially, which increases our risk of loss in the event that new platforms do not achieve commercial success. It is difficult to anticipate hardware development cycles, and we have made and will continue to make both internal and external software development
commitments and product investment decisions well in advance of the introduction of new hardware platforms, resulting in cash outflows without corresponding revenues. If new hardware platforms are delayed or do not achieve


Back to Index

consumer acceptance, we may be unable to recover our investments and our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, during such transition, our operating results may become more volatile and more difficult to predict, which could cause wide fluctuations in our stock price.

A number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the Internet. Future increased consumer acceptance and increases in the availability of online games or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in platform-based software and negatively impact sales of our products. Direct sales of software over the Internet by competitors could materially adversely affect our distribution business.

A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of titles, and we must continue to publish “hit” titles in order to succeed.

Grand Theft Auto

and certain
    of our other titles are “hit” products and have historically
    accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. For the year ended October
    31, 2005, our ten best selling titles accounted for approximately 48.2% of
    our revenues, with

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation
    2 accounting for 25.6% of our revenues;

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

for
    the PlayStation 2 accounting for 4.4% of our revenues;

Grand Theft Auto:
    San Andreas

for Xbox accounting for 4.1% of our revenues; and

Grand
    Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for the PSP accounting for 3.0% of our
    revenues. For the year ended October 31, 2004, our ten best selling titles
    accounted for approximately 46.3%
of our revenues, with

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation
2 accounting for 20.9% of our revenues;

Grand Theft Auto Double Pack

for
the Xbox accounting for 5.7% of our revenues;

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

for
the PlayStation 2 accounting for 3.6% of our revenues; and

Max Payne 2: The
Fall of Max Payne

for the PlayStation 2 accounting for 3.2% of our revenues.
For the year ended October 31, 2003, our ten best selling titles accounted for
approximately 50.6% of our revenues, with

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City

for
the PlayStation 2 and PC

accounting for 36.2% of our revenues. If we fail
to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful “hit” titles
or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial
release of our “hit” titles, our revenues and profits may decrease
substantially and we may incur losses.

We are dependent on our management and other key personnel for our success. If we fail to retain creative and product development personnel, our business could be seriously harmed.

We rely on our management and other
    key personnel for the successful operation of our business. In particular,
    we are highly dependent on the expertise, skills and knowledge of certain
    of our Rockstar employees responsible for content creation and development
    of

Grand Theft Auto

and
    other titles. We have reached an agreement
    in principle with respect to mutually satisfactory incentive compensation
    arrangements to retain these individuals for a three-year period, subject
    to the execution of a definitive agreement. The compensation arrangements
    could result in increased expenses and have a negative impact on our operating
    results. If we are unable to enter into a definitive agreement to continue
    to retain these individuals, or if one or more of these individuals otherwise
    leave the company, we may
    lose additional
    personnel, experience
    material
    interruptions in product development and delays in bringing products to market
    (including delays to our previously announced product release schedule),
    which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Additionally,
    failure to continue to attract and retain qualified management personnel
    could adversely affect our business and prospects.

Our efforts to diversify our product offerings and expand into the market for sports and other licensed titles may not be successful. Our significant investments in licenses for sports titles may not result in profitable operations.

We have recently diversified our product offerings by capitalizing on significant growth opportunities in the market for sports and other licensed action and strategy titles. Our success in this market will depend in part on our ability to attract licensors with popular properties and to enter into favorable arrangements with these licensors, including licensors representing the major sports leagues and players’ associations. Competition for sports and other licensed properties is intense. If we are unable to continue to obtain and maintain licenses to popular properties, our revenue and profitability with respect to these products could decline dramatically. Competition for licenses has also increased advances and royalties payable to
licensors, which currently represent substantial financial commitments on our behalf. We may be unable to continue to enter into favorable license agreements, for financial or other reasons, and despite our efforts to diversify our product offerings, we may be unable to achieve increased levels of revenues or profitability.


Back to Index

Our business is dependent on our ability to enter into favorable publishing and intellectual property licensing arrangements with third parties.

Our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis. We have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles. These agreements typically require us to make advance payments, pay royalties and satisfy other conditions. Our advance payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully, which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market. Software development costs, promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and third-party
licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software. Future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover advances to software developers and licensors, and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments, which are approximately $60.0 million for licensing and marketing and approximately $50.0 million for software development for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2006. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with third-party developers and licensors, the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that may be burdensome to us, and materially adversely affect our operating results. Failure to commercialize products that require significant investments
could result in corresponding charges to earnings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”

We are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs, and we must adapt to changes in software technologies.

We rely on third-party software developers for the development of certain of our titles. Quality third-party developers are continually in high demand. Software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future. Due to the limited number of third-party software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them, these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards, if at all. We depend on third-party software developers and our internal development studios to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections. The development cycle for new titles ranges
from twelve to thirty-six months and is expected to increase in connection with the development of next generation software. After development of a product, it may take between nine to twelve additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms. If developers experience financial difficulties, additional costs or unanticipated development delays, we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs.

Additionally, in order to stay competitive, our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development. Any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable.

The interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive both for our publishing and distribution operations.

We compete for both licenses to properties
    and the sale of interactive entertainment software with Sony, Microsoft and
    Nintendo, each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for
    its own platforms. Each of these competitors has the financial resources
    to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising
    campaigns, particularly for television spots. These companies may also increase
    their own software development efforts or focus on developing software products
    for third-party platforms. We also compete with domestic game publishers
    such as Electronic Arts, Activision, THQ, Midway Games and Atari and international
    publishers, such as SEGA, Vivendi, Ubi Soft, SCi Entertainment, Capcom, Konami
    and Namco. As our business is driven by hit titles, which require increasing
    budgets for development and marketing, the availability of significant financial
    resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing
    software games. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical,
    personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets
    for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers
    for commercially desirable properties. Our titles also compete with other
    forms of entertainment such as motion pictures, television and audio and
    video products featuring


Back to Index

similar themes, online computer programs and forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

Our distribution business also operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is based primarily on breadth, availability and quality of product lines; price; terms and conditions of sale; credit terms and availability; speed and accuracy of delivery; and effectiveness of sales and marketing programs. Our competitors include regional, national and international distributors, as well as hardware manufacturers and software publishers. We may lose market share or be forced in the future to reduce our prices in response to our competitors. Our distribution business has been adversely affected by lower sales volume of software titles, a decrease in average selling prices of interactive entertainment products as our industry transitions to
next generation technology and increased competition in the value software market.

Increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles.

Retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources, and competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support. Competition for retail shelf space is expected to increase, which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable levels of sales of our titles. Competitors with more extensive lines and popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers. Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve the levels of promotional support and shelf space that such competitors receive.

A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales. The loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business.

A substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers, two of which have recently merged. Sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 40.7% and 38.9% of our net revenues, respectively, for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, sales of our products to Wal-Mart accounted for 14.9% of our net revenues. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without long-term agreements or other commitments, and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time. Certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content. The loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to
principal customers, including as a result of a product being re-rated to “AO” (age 18 and over), could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business.

Returns of our published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results.

We are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers. Our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers which include credits and returns, when demand for specific products falls below expectations. We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions. While we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions, if return rates
and price concessions for our published titles exceed our reserves, our revenues could decline.

Failure to collect our accounts receivables on a timely basis will negatively impact our cash flow.

Our sales are typically made on credit. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment by our customers. As a result, we are subject to credit risks, particularly in the event that any of our receivables represent sales to a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets. Although we continually assess the creditworthiness of our customers, which are principally large, national retailers, if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow. From time to time we purchase insurance from financial institutions on our receivables, with certain limits, to help protect us from loss in the event of a customer’s bankruptcy or
insolvency.

We are subject to the rating
        of our content by the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Failure to
        obtain “M” ratings for certain of our products could negatively
        impact our sales. We are also subject to a Federal
        Trade Commission inquiry, class action complaints and a certain civil complaint.

The Entertainment Software Rating
    Board, sometimes referred to as the ESRB, requires game publishers to provide
    consumers with information relating to graphic violence, profanity or sexually
    explicit material contained in software titles, and imposes significant penalties
    for noncompliance. Certain countries have also established similar rating
    systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In some instances,
    we may be required to modify our products to comply with the requirements
    of rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of our products.
    Sales of certain of our titles have been prohibited in certain countries.
    Our software titles receive a rating of “E” (age 6 and older), “E10+”
(age 10 and older), “T” (age 13 and over) or “M” (age 17 and over). Many of our Rockstar titles have received an “M” rating. We believe that we comply with rating systems and properly display the ratings and content descriptions received for our titles. Although game publishers have been able to modify content to satisfy ESRB ratings standards for “M” ratings, if we are unable to obtain “M” ratings as a result of changes in the ESRB’s ratings standards or for other reasons, including the adoption of legislation in this area, our business and prospects could be negatively affected.

The ESRB requires publishers to conduct
    pertinent content audit certifications with respect to certain top selling
    titles, the objective of which is to assess what portion, if any, of the
    games on the market include undisclosed pertinent content on the disc that
    undermines the accuracy of the ESRB rating. This self audit procedure applies
    to certain current titles and may be applied to additional titles in the
    future. We are currently conducting a self audit in accordance with the ESRB’s
    requirements. It is possible that there may be content in our games that
    could be determined to be pertinent content that causes a change to our current
    ESRB rating. In such event, we may be required to record a reserve for anticipated
    product returns and inventory obsolescence which could expose us to additional
    litigation, administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities,
    and could adversely affect our operating results.

In July 2005, we were notified that
    the staff of the Federal Trade Commission’s Division of Advertising
    Practices is conducting an inquiry into advertising claims made for

Grand
    Theft Auto: San Andreas

following the re-rating of the title by the ESRB
    from an “M” rating to an “AO” rating (18 and over).
    This title was re-rated after an unauthorized third-party made certain content
    accessible that was not intended by us to be accessible in the playable version
    of the title. We have also received requests for documents and information
    relating to such title from certain states, and we are subject to class action
    complaints alleging consumer deception, false advertising and common law
    fraud and an action brought by the City Attorney of Los Angeles. We cannot
     predict the outcome of these pending matters, which could
    result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and judgments.
    Additionally, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant legal
    and other professional
    fees and
    expenses
    in connection
    with pending
    regulatory
    matters and litigation, and these matters have also diverted management’s
    attention from our business. See “Legal Proceedings.”

Our business and products are subject to increasing potential legislation. The adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products.

Several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry, including a bill, referred to as The Family Entertainment Protection Act, which was recently introduced into the Senate. Such bill proposes to prohibit the sale of “M” rated, “AO” rated and “Rating Pending” products to under-17 audiences. If the bill is adopted into law, it may limit the potential market for our “M” rated products, and adversely affect our operating results. Several proposals have also been made by state legislators (including in California, Michigan and Illinois) to regulate the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing violent or sexually explicit material by prohibiting the
sale of such products to under 17 or 18 audiences and proposing penalties for noncompliance. While such legislation has been successfully enjoined by industry and retail groups, the adoption into law of such legislation in federal and/or in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for our “M” rated titles.

Content policies adopted by retailers, consumer opposition and litigation could negatively impact sales of our products.

Retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material that they deem inappropriate for their businesses. If retailers decline to sell our “M” rated products or products containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material generally, or if our “M” rated products are re-rated “AO,” we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles, which in the case of our best selling

Grand Theft Auto

titles could seriously hurt our business. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas
and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns. Additionally, although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have been unsuccessful in the courts, claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time. See “Legal Proceedings.”

We cannot publish our console titles without the approval of hardware licensors who are also our competitors.

We are required to obtain a license from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo, who are also our competitors, to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms. Our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a title-by-title basis. As a result, the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms, and our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and, accordingly, our net revenues from titles for these hardware platforms, may be limited. If any licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term, or if the licensor were to terminate our license for any reason, we would be unable to publish additional
titles for that licensor’s platform. Termination of any such agreements could seriously hurt our business and prospects.

Microsoft released its next generation hardware platform into the marketplace in November 2005, and we expect that each of Sony and Nintendo will introduce their respective next generation platforms into the marketplace in 2006. In order to publish products for a new platform, we will be required to enter into a license agreement in advance of a platform’s commercial introduction, which gives the platform licensor the opportunity to set our fee structure. Certain platform licensors have retained the right to change fee structures for online game play, and each licensor’s ability to set royalty rates makes it difficult for us to forecast our costs. Increased costs could negatively impact our operating margins. We may be unable to enter
into license agreements for certain next generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all. Failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business.

Sony and Nintendo are the sole manufacturers of the titles we publish under license from them. Games for the Xbox and Xbox 360 must be manufactured by manufacturers pre-approved by Microsoft. Each of these manufacturers also publishes software for its own platforms and manufactures titles for all of its other licensees and may choose to give priority to its own titles or those of other publishers if it has insufficient manufacturing capacity or if there is increased demand for its or other publishers’ products. In addition, these manufacturers may not have sufficient production capacity to satisfy our scheduling requirements during any period of sustained demand. If manufacturers do not supply us with finished titles on favorable terms
without delays, our operations would be materially interrupted, and we would be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of our product to sell to our customers. If we cannot obtain sufficient product supplies, our net revenues will decline and we could incur losses.

Our quarterly operating results are highly seasonal and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our stock price to decline.

We have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results. The interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters), due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday buying season. Our failure or inability to introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results. The uncertainties associated with software development, manufacturing lead times, production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will
ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations. In future quarters, our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and the price of our stock could decline significantly.

Our expansion and acquisitions may strain our operations, and we may not have sufficient financial resources to continue to expand our operations at previous levels.

We have expanded through internal growth and acquisitions, which has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We have expanded our publishing operations, significantly increased our advances to licensors and developers and manufacturing expenditures and enlarged our work force. To successfully manage this growth, we must continue to implement and improve our operating systems as well as hire, train and manage a substantial and increasing number of management, technical, marketing, administrative and other personnel. We may be unable to effectively manage our expanding and geographically dispersed operations.


Back to Index

We have acquired rights to various properties and businesses, and we intend to continue to pursue opportunities by making selective acquisitions consistent with our business strategy. We may be unable to successfully integrate new personnel, properties or businesses into our operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate personnel, properties or businesses into our operations, we may incur significant charges.

Our publishing and distribution activities require significant cash resources. We may be required to seek debt or equity financing to fund the cost of continued expansion. The issuance of equity securities would result in dilution to the interests of our stockholders.

Our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry, and we may fail to properly assess consumer tastes and preferences.

Our business is subject to all of the risks generally associated with the entertainment industry and, accordingly, our future operating results will depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the popularity, price and timing of new hardware platforms being released; economic, political and military conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending; changes in consumer demographics; the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment; and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot be predicted. In order to plan for acquisition and promotional activities, we must anticipate and respond to rapid changes in consumer tastes and preferences. A decline in the
popularity of certain game genres or particular platforms could cause sales of our titles to decline dramatically. The period of time necessary to develop new game titles, obtain approvals of platform licensors and produce finished products is unpredictable. During this period, consumer appeal for a particular title may decrease, causing product sales to fall short of expectations.

We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights or avoid claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of others.

We develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties. We attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and distribution. Our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying. Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary. Well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the Internet. Although we attempt to incorporate protective
measures into our software, piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability.

With advances in technology, game content and software graphics are expected to become more realistic. As a result, we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights. Although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of third-party developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others, it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others has or may
occur. Any claims of infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming, costly and difficult to defend. Moreover, intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products, obtain a license or redesign our products, which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays.

Our software is susceptible to errors, which can harm our financial results and reputation.

The technological advancements of new hardware platforms results in the development of more complex software products. As software products become more complex, the risk of undetected errors in products when first introduced increases. If, despite testing, errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made, we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance, product returns, loss of revenues and damage to our reputation.

Gross margins relating to our distribution business have been historically narrow which increases the impact of variations in costs on our operating results

.

As a result of intense price competition, our gross margins in our distribution business have historically been narrow and may continue to be narrow in the future. Accordingly, slight variations in operating costs and expenses could result in losses in our distribution business from period to period.

We may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.

A significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is comprised of personnel and facilities. In the event of a significant decline in revenues, we may not be able to exit facilities, reduce personnel, or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs. Management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and profit.

Our distribution business is dependent on suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfil customer orders on a timely basis.

Our ability to obtain particular
    products in required quantities and to fulfill customer orders on a timely
    basis is important to our success. In most cases, we have no guaranteed price
    or delivery agreements with suppliers. In certain product categories, limited
    price concessions or return rights offered by publishers may have a bearing
    on the amount of product we may be willing to purchase. Our industry may
    experience significant hardware supply shortages from time to time due to
    the inability of certain manufacturers to supply certain products on a timely
    basis. As a result, we have experienced, and may in the future continue to
    experience, short-term hardware inventory shortages. Further, manufacturers
    or publishers who currently distribute their products through us may decide
    to distribute, or to substantially increase their existing distribution,
    through other distributors, or directly to retailers.

We are subject to the risk that our inventory values may decline and protective terms under supplier arrangements may not adequately cover the decline in values.

The interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards. These changes may cause inventory to decline substantially in value over time or to become obsolete. We are exposed to inventory risk in our distribution business to the extent that supplier price concessions are not available to us on all products or quantities. In addition, suppliers may become insolvent and unable to fulfil price concession obligations.

We are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade, including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar.

Sales in international markets, primarily in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues. Sales in international markets accounted for approximately 32.0% and 27.5%, respectively, of our net revenues for fiscal 2005 and 2004. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks; tariffs and duties; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; shipping delays; and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results. All of our international sales are made in local currencies, which could fluctuate against the dollar. While we may use forward exchange contracts to a
limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk, our results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.

The market price for our common stock may be highly volatile as a result of, among other things, factors affecting the industry.

The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. Factors such as our operating results, announcements by us or our competitors and various factors affecting the interactive entertainment software industry may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock.


Back to Index

We are subject to rapidly evolving regulation affecting financial reporting, accounting and corporate governance matters.

In response to recent corporate events, legislators and government agencies have focused on the integrity of financial reporting, and regulatory accounting bodies have recently announced their intention to issue several new accounting standards, including a recently adopted standard that accounts for stock options as compensation expense. Additionally, recently enacted legislation focused on corporate governance, auditing and internal accounting controls imposes compliance burdens on us, and will require us to continue to devote substantial financial, technical and personnel resources to address various compliance issues and audit requirements.

Properties

Our principal executive offices are located at 622 Broadway, New York, New York in approximately 48,000 square feet of space under a ten-year lease, which provides for annual rent of approximately $1,533,000. We also sublease an additional 16,000 square feet at this location for an annual rent of approximately $368,000.

Take-Two Interactive Software Europe leases 12,500 square feet of office space in Windsor, United Kingdom. The lease provides for a current annual rent of approximately $635,000 plus taxes and utilities, and expires in 2011. Rockstar North currently leases 40,000 square feet of office space in Edinburgh, Scotland, at an annual rent of approximately $1,816,000. The lease expires in 2014.

2K Games leases approximately 14,000
    square feet of office space in New York, New York under five and eight-year
    leases, which provide for annual rent of approximately $553,000. In January
    2006, a fire in a lower floor of this building caused significant damage
    to these offices and we have temporarily relocated all of the employees based
    in these
    offices,
    consisting
    primarily
    of marketing and administrative personnel, and to a limited extent, product
    testing personnel. While we are still determining the overall financial and
    operational impact of the fire, we do not expect any significant effect on
    our business.

Effective September 2004, Jack of All Games entered into a lease for 400,000 square feet of new office and warehouse space in Cincinnati, Ohio. The lease provides for annual rent of approximately $1,015,000, plus taxes and insurance, and expires in September 2014. Jack of All Games is currently transitioning operations from its former warehouse to this new facility and expects the transition to be completed by January 2006. As of October 31, 2005, there are aggregate lease obligations of $660,000 through June 2006 related to the former warehouse.

In addition, our other subsidiaries lease office space in Sydney and Braddon, Australia; Vienna, Austria; Ontario, Toronto and Vancouver, Canada; Paris, France; Munich, Germany; Breda, Netherlands; Madrid, Spain; Geneva, Switzerland; Milan, Italy; Auckland, New Zealand; London, Lincoln, Leighton Buzzard, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Leeds, UK; Hong Kong, China; San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Camarillo, San Rafael and West Village, California; Baltimore and Hunt Valley, Maryland; Quincy, Massachusetts; Fenton, Missouri; Austin, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Bellevue, Washington; for an aggregate annual rent of approximately $8,294,000.

Legal Proceedings

Following the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

by the ESRB from a Mature 17+ “M” rating to an Adults Only 18+ “AO” rating in July 2005, we were notified by the staff of the Federal Trade Commission’s (“FTC”)
    Division of Advertising Practices that it is conducting an inquiry into advertising
    claims made for the title and whether we engaged in unfair or deceptive acts
    or practices in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
    15 U.S.C., Section 45. We are cooperating with the FTC inquiry and believe
that we acted in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

In January 2006, the City Attorney
    for the City of Los Angeles filed a complaint against the company and its
    subsidiary, Rockstar Games, in the Superior Court of the State of California.
    The complaint alleges that the company and Rockstar violated sections of
    the California Business and Professions Code prohibiting untrue and misleading
    statements and unfair competition and that the company and Rockstar were
    unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure to disclose that

Grand
    Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content which should
    have resulted in the game receiving an Adults Only (“AO”) rating
    from the ESRB rather than a Mature (“M”) rating. The complaint
    also alleges that we made misleading statements as to the origin of the “hidden”
    content. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, restitution for purchasers
    of the game and civil
    fines. We believe that the allegations in the City Attorney’s
    complaint are without merit, and intend to vigorously defend against these
    claims. We have also received requests for documents and information from
    the Attorneys General of the States of North Carolina and Connecticut relating
    to

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

.

In July 2005, we received three purported
    class action complaints against the company and Rockstar, two of which were
    filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York
    (the “New York
    Actions”) and one of which was filed in the United States
    District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania
    Action”). On September 8, 2005, another similar complaint was filed
    in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial District, St. Clair County,
    Illinois (the “Illinois Action”). The plaintiffs, alleged purchasers
    of the

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

game, allege that the company
    and Rockstar engaged in consumer deception, false advertising and common
    law fraud and were unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure of
    the company and Rockstar to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content,
    which resulted in the game receiving an “M” rating from the ESRB
    rather than an “AO” rating. The complaints seek unspecified damages,
    declarations of various violations of law and


Back to Index

litigation costs. The New York Actions and the Pennsylvania Action have been consolidated in the Southern District of New York under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer

Litigation (05-CV-6734 (BSJ)). The Illinois Action has been removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and the company has moved the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for an order transferring the Illinois Action to the Southern District of New York for coordinated or consolidated proceedings with the actions pending in New York. We believe that these complaints are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend and seek dismissals of these actions.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of the Estates of Arnold Strickland and Ace Mealer brought an action in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against the company, Sony Computer of America, Wal-Mart, GameStop and Devin Moore alleging under Alabama’s manufacturers’ liability and wrongful death statutes that the company’s video games designed, manufactured, marketed and/or supplied to Mr. Moore resulted in “copycat violence” that caused the death of Messrs. Strickland and Mealer. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants in excess of $600 million. Wal-Mart and Sony Computer of America have tendered their defense and requested indemnification from the company,
and the company has accepted such tender. The company’s motion to dismiss the action was denied and the company  moved to have certain issues certified for an immediate interlocutory appeal before the Alabama Supreme Court. We believe that the complaint is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend and seek dismissal of this action.

We have been advised that a purported
    class action has been filed in the Southern District of New York on behalf
    of St. Clair Shore General Employees Retirement System and other similarly
    situated plaintiffs against the company and certain individuals alleging
    violations of the Securities Exchange Act regarding purported breaches of
    fiduciary duty and illegal insider trading. We have not been served in the
    action and not yet obtained or reviewed a copy of the complaint.

In January 2006, a proceeding was commenced in Delaware Chancery Court (

Veek v.
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.)

seeking to compel the company to produce certain books and records pursuant to Section
220 of Delaware Corporation Law in connection with

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

.

We are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business, which in management’s opinion will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

in
North America during fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by product returns
 and related costs as a result of the re-rating of
this title from “M” to “AO.” In July 2005, we initially
recorded a provision of $32,637 for product returns and related costs as a result
of the re-rating. The provision was subsequently reduced by approximately $8,154
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to better than expected sell-through
of the product and lower processing costs related to product returns. The resulting
impact on our consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2005 was a reduction
of $24.5 million, $5.9 million, 18.6 million and $18.6 million for net revenues,
cost of goods sold, gross profit and income from operations, respectively. At
October 31, 2005, our accounts receivable balance is net of reserves of approximately
$7,714 for remaining product returns primarily related to our North American
retail inventory of

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion
      and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in
    thousands, except per share amounts)

Overview

We are a leading global publisher of interactive software games designed for personal computers, and video game consoles and handheld platforms manufactured by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. We also distribute our products as well as third-party software, hardware and accessories to retail outlets in North America through our Jack of All Games subsidiary, and we have sales, marketing and publishing operations in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom.

Our principal sources of revenue are derived from publishing and distribution operations. Publishing revenues are derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by third parties. Operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new, commercially successful products and to manage costs associated with business acquisitions and software product development. We develop most of our frontline products internally, and we own major intellectual properties, which we believe permits us to maximize profitability. Operating margins for titles developed by third parties, or for which we do not own the intellectual property, are affected by costs to acquire
licenses and amounts due to developers.

Our distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third-party software titles, accessories and hardware. Operating margins in our distribution business are dependent in part on the mix of software and hardware sales, with software generating higher margins than hardware. Publishing activities generate significantly higher margins than distribution activities, with sales of PC software titles resulting in higher margins than sales of products designed for video game consoles and handheld platforms.

We have pursued a growth strategy by capitalizing on the widespread market acceptance of video game consoles, as well as the growing popularity of innovative action games that appeal to mature audiences. We have established a portfolio of successful proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms. We expect to continue to be a leader in the mature, action product category by leveraging our existing franchises and developing new brands.

The ESRB, through its ratings system, requires game publishers to provide consumers with information relating to graphic violence, profanity or sexually explicit material contained in software titles. Consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns, and various governmental bodies have proposed regulation aimed at our industry to prohibit the sale of software containing such material to minors. Additionally, retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing graphic violence or sexually explicit material that they deem
inappropriate for their businesses. Many of our Rockstar titles have received an “M” rating. If retailers decline to sell our “M” rated products or if our “M” rated products are re-rated “AO,” we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles, which in the case of our best selling

Grand Theft Auto

titles could seriously hurt our business.

The ESRB requires publishers to conduct
    pertinent content audit certifications with respect to certain top selling
    titles, the objective of which is to assess what portion, if any, of the
    games on the market include undisclosed pertinent content on the disc that
    undermines the accuracy of the ESRB rating. This self audit procedure applies
    to certain current titles and may be applied to additional titles in the
    future. We are currently conducting a self audit in accordance with the ESRB’s
    requirements. It is possible that there may be content in our games that
    could be determined to be pertinent content that causes a change to our current
    ESRB rating. In such event, we may be required to record a reserve for anticipated
    product returns and inventory obsolescence which could expose us to additional
    litigation, administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities,
    and could adversely affect our operating results.

We have diversified our product offerings by capitalizing on significant growth opportunities in the market for sports and other licensed action and strategy titles. During fiscal 2005, we made several strategic acquisitions of leading sports development studios and entered into license agreements with major sports leagues to develop sports titles. We also entered into license agreements for several popular entertainment properties, acquired well-known intellectual property rights, and entered into distribution and publishing arrangements for major action and strategy PC titles.

The video game industry is currently undergoing a transition due to the introduction of next-generation hardware platforms and new software for these platforms. In 2005, Sony introduced the PlayStation Portable (PSP), a new handheld gaming system, followed by Microsoft’s release of the Xbox 360, a next-generation console platform. Sony is expected to introduce the PlayStation 3, and Nintendo is

planning the launch of the Revolution console system in 2006. During this transition to next-generation hardware platforms, our operating results may become more volatile and more difficult to predict.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of capitalized software development costs, licenses and other intangibles, inventories, realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for returns, price concessions and doubtful accounts. Actual amounts could differ significantly
from these estimates.

Stock Split

In April 2005, we effected a three-for-two stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Accordingly, all share and per-share data in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto give retroactive effect to the stock split.

Critical Accounting Policies

We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers. We apply the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition” in conjunction with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.” Accordingly, we recognize revenue for software when there is (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the software is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. Our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60-day terms.

Revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions. In specific circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of receivables is probable, we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivables is probable.

Allowances for Returns and Price Concessions

We accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of our products, we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them. Our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions, including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.


Back to Index

Our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However, we sometimes accept returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers, which includes credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations.

We make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue. We estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of the hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of sell-through rates, sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers.

Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. We believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of reserves recorded in connection with the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in July 2005.

Software Development Costs

We utilize both internal development teams and third-party software developers to develop our products.

We capitalize internal software development costs, as well as film production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a title. Amortization of such costs as a component of cost of sales is recorded on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to the total of current and estimated future sales for the title or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs based on undiscounted future cash flows and charge to cost of sales any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable.

Our agreements with third-party developers generally provide us with exclusive publishing and distribution rights and require us to make advance payments that are recouped against royalties due to the developer based on the contractual amounts of product sales, adjusted for certain costs. Advance payments are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and amortized as royalties in cost of sales on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to the total of current and estimated future sales for that title or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the respective agreements. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate the recoverability of advanced
development payments and unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine the amounts unlikely to be realized through product sales. Advance payments are charged to cost of sales in the amount that management determines is unrecoverable in the period in which such determination is made or if management determines that it will cancel a development project. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales for a title include: historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Licenses

Licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to licensors of intellectual property rights. Our agreements with certain licensors provide for minimum guaranteed payments for intellectual property licenses and other licensing rights which may be recouped against amounts due to the licensor or developer based on product sales. Minimum guaranteed payments are initially recorded as an asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract when no significant performance remains with the licensor. When significant performance remains with the licensor, we record payments when actually paid.


Back to Index

Licenses are amortized as royalties in cost of sales on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to the total of current and estimated future sales for that title or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the respective agreements. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate licenses as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine the amounts unlikely to be realized through product sales. License-based assets are charged to cost of sales in the amount that management determines is not probable of being recouped at the contractual royalty rate based on current and future sales in the period in which such determination is made. Criteria used to
evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales for a title include: historical performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Income Taxes

Income tax assets and liabilities are determined by taxable jurisdiction. We do not provide taxes on undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. The total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was approximately $166,000 as of October 31, 2005. It is currently our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance. Accordingly, no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends to us. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on whether we generate future taxable income of the appropriate type. In addition,
we may adopt tax planning strategies to realize these assets. If future taxable income does not materialize or tax planning strategies are not effective, we may be required to record a valuation allowance.

New tax legislation currently in place is intended to replace the extraterritorial income (“ETI”) exclusion. We currently derive benefits from the ETI exclusion, which was limited to 80% of the otherwise allowable exclusion for 10 months in calendar year 2005 and will be further limited to 60% of the otherwise allowable exclusion for 10 months in calendar year 2006. There will be no ETI deduction available after calendar year 2006. The new legislation permits a deduction from taxable income based on certain qualified income from domestic production activities and may be available to us in 2006.

This legislation also provides for a one-time 85% dividends received deduction on repatriation of foreign earnings, which was applicable to us if utilized in fiscal 2005. Historically, we have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no incremental taxes have been provided thereon. We did not repatriate foreign earnings under this provision in fiscal 2005.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements – An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.” SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payment” which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” This statement supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The revised statement addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The revised statement is
effective as of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.


Back to Index

We will adopt SFAS 123(R), effective November 1, 2005, as required, and have chosen the Modified Prospective Application (“MPA”) method for implementing SFAS 123(R). Under the MPA method, new awards will be valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption. Outstanding prior awards that are unvested as of October 31, 2005 will be recognized as compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. Prior periods will not be restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share.

We currently estimate that income from operations in fiscal 2006 will be reduced by additional expense of approximately $22.0 million to $25.0 million due to the adoption of this Standard. However, the actual impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) in fiscal 2006 could differ from this estimate depending upon the number and timing of options granted during fiscal 2006, as well as their vesting period and vesting criteria. Our assessment, which includes an estimate for future grants, is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price
and employee stock option exercise behaviors. As such, our actual stock option expense may differ materially from this estimate.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 (“SFAS 153”), “Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for non-monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153, effective August 1, 2005, did not have an impact on our financial statements.

Business Acquisitions

During the two years ended October
    31, 2005, we consummated the acquisitions described below, which largely
    reflects our efforts to continue to add seasoned development studios, intellectual
    properties and talented personnel resources to our existing infrastructure.
    To the extent that the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions is
    preliminary, we do not expect that the final purchase price allocation will
    be materially different. With the exception of the acquisition of TDK, the
proforma impact of these acquisitions on fiscal 2005 and 2004 was not material.

Irrational Studios LLC.

In August 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Irrational Studios (“Irrational”), the developer of certain of our titles. The purchase price consisted of $4,212 in cash and $2,000 of restricted stock, which was payable at closing, $1,550 of development advances previously paid to Irrational and $2,000 of deferred consideration which is payable in equal amounts on the first and second anniversary dates of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded $2,250 of identifiable intangible assets, $7,665 of goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, $187 of non-current assets and $340 of net current liabilities, on a preliminary basis. We also agreed to make
additional payments of $2,000 based on the delivery of products which will be recorded as additional purchase price when the conditions requiring their payment are met.

Gaia Capital Group.

In June 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Gaia Capital Group (“Gaia”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the developers of certain of our titles. The purchase price consisted of $5,748 in cash, $4,055 of development advances previously paid to Gaia and deferred consideration of $1,597. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded $3,940 of identifiable intangible assets, $7,918 of goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, $528 of non-current assets and $986 of net current liabilities, on a preliminary basis.

Visual Concepts Entertainment and Kush Games.

In January 2005, we acquired from SEGA all of the outstanding capital stock of Visual Concepts Entertainment and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kush


Back to Index

Games, the developers of certain of our sports titles, and certain intellectual property rights associated with these products. The purchase price consisted of $27,794 in cash, $1,866 of development advances previously paid to SEGA and contingent consideration of $2,593 based on the release of certain titles. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded $7,980 of identifiable intangible assets, $29,433 of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, $1,196 of non-current assets, $3,164 of net current liabilities and $3,192 of deferred tax liabilities related to identifiable intangible assets, on a preliminary basis.

Indie.

In October 2004, we acquired certain assets from Microsoft, including Indie, the developer of the successful

Top Spin

(tennis),

Amped

series (snowboarding) and

Links

(golf) sports games, and the intellectual property rights associated with these products. The purchase price for these assets was $18,500 paid in cash at closing. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded identifiable intangible assets of $5,828, goodwill of $9,890, which is deductible for tax purposes, fixed assets of $280, accounts receivable of $1,317 and net other current assets of $1,185.

Venom

. In September 2004, we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of Venom, a UK-based developer of the boxing games

Rocky

and

Rocky Legends

. The purchase price was $1,181 paid in cash at closing. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded identifiable intangibles of $750, goodwill of $626, which is deductible for tax purposes, and net current liabilities of $195.

Mobius (Rockstar Leeds)

. In March 2004, we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of Mobius, a UK-based developer of titles for handheld platforms, including Sony’s PSP platform. The purchase price was approximately $4,515, of which $3,593 was paid in cash at closing and approximately $922 was paid in March 2005. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded identifiable intangibles of $96, goodwill of $4,681, which is not deductible for tax purposes, and net liabilities of $262. We also agreed to make additional contingent payments of approximately $1,950 based on delivery of products which will be recorded as additional purchase price when the conditions requiring their payment are met.

TDK

. In December 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock and assumed certain liabilities of TDK Mediactive, Inc. (“TDK”). The purchase price of approximately $21,222 consisted of $16,062 in cash (which includes $8,051 previously due to TDK under a distribution agreement) and the issuance of 163,641 shares of restricted stock valued at $5,160. In connection with the acquisition, we recorded identifiable intangibles of $7,690, goodwill of $16,101, which is not deductible for tax purposes, net deferred tax assets of $978 and net liabilities of $3,547. The proforma impact of this acquisition on the financial statements in fiscal 2004 was not material as the acquisition was made near the beginning of the year. The
proforma impact on fiscal 2003 reduced net income by $17,715 to $80,403.

The acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase transactions and, accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of the acquired businesses are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the respective dates of acquisition.

Pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” the results of operations of Destineer Publishing Corp. (“Destineer”), a publisher of PC games, were consolidated in our financial statements effective November 1, 2003 through January 31, 2005. Effective February 1, 2005, we are no longer considered the primary beneficiary of Destineer nor do we hold a significant variable interest in Destineer. Accordingly, pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46 (R), the results of Destineer’s operations are not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements subsequent to February 1, 2005. The consolidation of Destineer did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net Revenues

.

The increase in net revenues was attributable to growth in our publishing business. Publishing net revenues were led by strong sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

and

The Warriors

on multiple platforms and

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for the PSP. Sales of

Sid Meier’s Civilization IV

and

Stronghold


for PC and our sports titles for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, including

Major League Baseball 2K5

, also contributed to the increase in publishing revenues. Publishing net revenues in fiscal 2004 primarily reflect sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2, which was released in October 2004, and

Grand Theft Auto Double Pack

and

Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne

for Xbox and the PlayStation 2. Publishing revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2004 include licensing revenues of $17,774 and $20,104, respectively.

Sales of our

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

title in North America during fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by product returns due to the re-rating of this title. In July 2005, a provision of $32,637 was recorded for product returns and related costs as a result of the re-rating. The provision was subsequently reduced by approximately $8,154 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to better than expected sell-through of the product and lower processing costs related to product returns. At October 31, 2005, our accounts receivable balance is net of reserves of approximately $7,714 for remaining product returns primarily related to our North American retail inventory of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

Products designed for video game console platforms accounted for 78.5% of fiscal 2005 publishing revenues as compared to 93.1% for fiscal 2004. Products designed for PC platforms accounted for 11.5% of fiscal 2005 publishing revenues as compared to 2.7% for fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenues of products for PC platforms as a percentage of publishing revenues was primarily attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Sid Meier’s Civilization IV

and

Stronghold 2

for PC. We anticipate that our platform mix will continue to be heavily weighted toward console platforms and the PSP handheld system, but may fluctuate from period to period.

Distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third-party software titles, accessories and hardware. The decrease in distribution revenues was primarily attributable to lower sales volume of software titles, a decrease in average selling prices of interactive entertainment products as our industry transitions to next generation hardware platforms and increased competition in the value software market. The decline in sales of software titles was partially offset by an increase in hardware sales,

primarily attributable to demand for the Sony PSP system and related accessories.

International operations accounted
    for approximately $385,000, or 32.0% of net revenues for fiscal 2005 compared
    to $310,379 or 27.5% of net revenues for fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily
    attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation
    2, Xbox and PC, sales of

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

for the PlayStation
    2, Xbox and PSP, sales of

The Warriors

for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox,
    and sales of

Sid Meier’s Civilization IV

and

Stronghold 2

for

PC.
    International revenues for fiscal 2004 were primarily attributable to sales
    of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2, which was
    released in October 2004, various

Grand Theft Auto

titles,

Max
    Payne
2: The Fall of Max Payne

and

Red Dead Revolver.

In fiscal 2005 and 2004, net revenues included approximately $23,594 and $35,826, respectively, of benefit from changes in foreign exchange rates. We expect international net revenues to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues.

Product costs.

The decrease in product costs was due to the higher proportion of publishing revenues, which have lower product costs than distribution revenues. The decrease in product costs was also due to the increase in net revenues of publishing PC products which have lower costs than console products. The decrease in overall product costs was slightly offset by a shift in the product mix within our distribution operations toward hardware products which have higher costs than software titles.

Royalties.

The increase
    in royalties was primarily attributable to expense associated with

Grand
    Theft Auto: San Andreas

under our internal Rockstar royalty program,
    which provides for increasing royalty levels as product net revenues increase.
    Royalties
    also increased as a result of internal royalty expense associated with sales
    of

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories,
    The Warriors

and external royalty expense associated with our sports
    titles, including

Major League Baseball 2K5.

Aggregate internal royalty
    expense, excluding employer payroll taxes, for fiscal 2005 and 2004 amounted
    to $83,774 and $45,910, respectively.

Software development costs.

The increase in software development costs was due to the increased sales of our internally developed titles, including

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition,

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

and

The Warriors

resulting in higher amortization of capitalized costs as compared to fiscal 2004.

In future periods, cost of goods sold may be adversely affected by higher manufacturing and other costs, price competition and by changes in product, sales mix, distribution channels and royalty arrangements.

Selling and marketing

. The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to higher advertising and promotional spending, which increased by $28,912 to $101,077 in fiscal 2005. The additional spending was for new and existing products, including

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, The Warriors

and

Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition

across multiple platforms,

Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories

for the PSP and to promote our various titles under our new 2K publishing labels. In addition, the increase was due to higher personnel expense of approximately $5,500, which is consistent with the growth of our business, and to additional expenditures related to our increased presence at E3, an industry trade
exhibition, held in May each year.

General and administrative.

The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase of approximately $15,400 in professional fees related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, legal matters and process improvement and an increase of approximately $5,600 in compensation and related costs for additional personnel to support the growth of our business. In addition, rental and office expenses increased approximately $5,000 due to recently acquired development studios and the


Back to Index

opening of a new office for our 2K publishing labels in fiscal 2005. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense from the prior comparable period. During fiscal 2004, personnel expenses included $3,365 of severance charges, signing bonuses and restricted stock expenses, primarily attributable to senior management changes and additional rent expense associated with relocating a European office.

Research and development.

The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to increased personnel and related expenses of approximately $25,800 associated with development studios that were acquired during fiscal 2005. Increased personnel expenses are attributable to higher staffing levels, reflecting our strategy of bringing more of our development in-house. A substantial portion of our research and development costs are capitalized once software development projects reach technological feasibility, which is relatively early in the development process, and subsequently amortized as cost of goods sold.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation related to the upgrading of software systems, our new office and warehouse facility for our Jack of All Games subsidiary, additional leasehold improvements related to development studios acquired in fiscal 2005 and the addition of new offices for our 2K publishing labels.

Income from operations.

Income
    from operations decreased by $62,153, or 60.9%, to $39,981 for fiscal 2005
    from $102,134 for fiscal 2004. As discussed above, the decrease was primarily
    due to higher operating expenses resulting from an increase in advertising
    and promotional support for our products, an increase in professional fees
    for regulatory and compliance matters and additional personnel and office
    expenses to support the growth of our business. The decrease in income from
    operations was also due to approximately $18,609 of product returns
    and related costs as a result of the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San
    Andreas

.
    Changes in foreign exchange rates benefited income from operations in fiscal
    and
    2004 by
    approximately
$1,268 and $1,074, respectively.

Interest income, net.

Interest income increased by $1,739, or 88.0% to $3,715 for fiscal 2005 from $1,976 for fiscal 2004 due to interest earned on a higher average cash balance.

Provision for income taxes.

Income
    tax expense was $6,221 for fiscal 2005 as compared to $31,232 for fiscal
    2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in taxable income
    and a reduction in the annual effective tax rate. The annual effective tax
    rate was 14.2% for fiscal 2005, as compared to 32.3% for fiscal 2004. The
    lower annual effective tax rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of
    earnings with a greater proportion of income being generated in lower tax
    jurisdictions (13.0% decrease to the effective tax rate) and a loss being
    generated in a higher tax jurisdiction. The lower annual effective tax rate
    in fiscal 2005 was also due to a higher extraterritorial income tax benefit
    (“ETI”) (6.2%
decrease to the effective tax rate). The fiscal 2004 tax provision included benefits
    from a change in the mix of earnings with a greater proportion of income
    from lower tax jurisdictions (3.9% decrease to the effective tax rate) and
    from ETI (4.0% decrease to the effective tax rate) partially offset by the
    nondeductibility of the payment of a $7.5 million civil penalty in connection
    with an SEC settlement (2.7% increase to the effective rate).

At October 31, 2005, we had capital loss carryforwards totalling approximately $26,800. The capital loss carryforwards will expire in the periods fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008. Management does not expect to generate sufficient taxable income from capital transactions prior to the expiration of these benefits, and accordingly a valuation allowance was recorded in fiscal 2003 for this asset as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards will not be realized. At October 31, 2005, we had foreign net operating losses of approximately $10,000 expiring between 2006 and 2010, and state net operating losses of approximately $93,000 expiring between 2011 and 2026. Management does not expect to generate sufficient
taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in future years to fully utilize the net operating losses before expiration. Accordingly, valuation allowances have been recorded for these assets in the amount of $3,200 and $6,000, respectively.


Back to Index

We are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. We believe that any assessments in excess of the amounts provided for will not have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net income

.

Net income was $37,475 for fiscal 2005 as compared to net income of $65,378 for fiscal 2004, a decrease of $27,903, or 42.7% and resulted from the changes referred to above.

Diluted net income per share.

Diluted net income per share decreased $0.42 or 44.6% to $0.53 for fiscal 2005 from $0.95 for fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower net income and a slight increase in the weighted average common shares outstanding.

Net Revenues.

The increase in net revenues was attributable to growth in our publishing business.

The increase in publishing revenues was primarily attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2, which was released in October 2004. Sales of sports titles for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox also contributed to the increase in publishing revenues. Publishing net revenues in fiscal 2004 and 2003 include licensing revenues of $20,104 and $25,002, respectively.

Products designed for video game console platforms accounted for 93.1% of fiscal 2004 publishing revenues as compared to 81.2% for fiscal 2003. Products designed for PC platforms accounted for 2.7% of fiscal 2004 publishing revenues as compared to 17.2% for fiscal 2003.

Distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third-party software titles, accessories and hardware. The decrease in distribution revenues was attributable to lower PlayStation 2 console hardware sales due to reduced availability in the market. The lack of PlayStation 2 hardware also resulted in fewer customer orders for the PlayStation 2 software. In addition, we experienced lower sales of value-priced product for the PlayStation, which is nearing the end of its hardware lifecycle. These decreases were partially offset by growth in value and frontline software. International operations accounted for approximately $310,379 or 27.5% of net revenues for fiscal 2004 compared to $288,753, or 27.9% of net revenues for fiscal 2003. The increase in
absolute dollars was primarily attributable to sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2. Higher foreign exchange rates benefited net revenues by approximately $35,826.

Product Costs.

The increase in product costs was primarily attributable to higher costs associated with products designed for console platforms. Product costs increased as a percentage of net revenues due to a change in the mix of our publishing business, which reflected a smaller percentage of higher margin PC business compared to the prior year. In addition, we also introduced sports titles at a value price point which resulted in a relatively low margin. Product costs for fiscal 2003 included a charge of $7,892 relating to the impairment of intangibles related to certain products in development.

Royalties

. The increase in royalties was primarily due to third-party royalties associated with sports titles and increased expenses related to a royalty program based on product sales for certain of our internal development personnel.

Software Development Costs

. Software development costs increased due to the release of a greater number of internally developed titles during fiscal 2004 resulting in higher amortization of capitalized costs. Fiscal 2004 also includes a write off of $3,020 for a project that was abandoned during the year.

In future periods, cost of goods sold may be adversely affected by manufacturing and other costs, price competition and by changes in product, sales mix and distribution channels.

Selling and marketing.

The increase in selling and marketing expense was attributable to increased levels of advertising and promotional support for existing and new titles, specifically the ESPN sports titles, as well as higher personnel expenses, and is consistent with the growth of our business.

General and administrative.

The increase in general and administrative expense was principally attributable to higher professional fees and rent, partly offset by the absence of a fiscal 2003 charge of $7,028 associated with the consolidation of our distribution operations. Higher professional fees were incurred in connection with legal and regulatory matters and were partly offset by the reimbursement of $922 of legal fees from insurance proceeds. The increase in rent expense included costs associated with relocating a European office and additional space in our corporate offices.

Research and development

. Research and development costs increased primarily due to the acquisitions of development studios, as well as increased personnel costs. Once software development projects reach technological feasibility, which is relatively early in the development process, a substantial portion of our research and development costs are capitalized and subsequently amortized as cost of goods sold.

Depreciation and amortization.

In fiscal 2003, we incurred a $4,407 charge related to the impairment of a customer list from a previous acquisition as a result of the consolidation of our distribution operations. Excluding this fiscal 2003 charge, there was an increase in depreciation and amortization in fiscal 2004 principally due to higher depreciation related to the build out of our corporate offices and the implementation of software systems.

Income from Operations

.

Income from operations decreased by $60,877 or 37.3%, to $102,134 for fiscal 2004 from $163,011 for fiscal 2003, due to the changes referred to above. Higher foreign exchange rates benefited income from operations by approximately $1,074.


Back to Index

Interest Income, net

.

Interest income decreased by $289, or 12.8% for fiscal 2004, and was attributable to interest earned on invested cash.

Provision for Settlement

.

In June 2005, in connection with a settlement of an SEC investigation related to our accounting, which was the subject of our previously reported restatements of our financial statements in February 2002 and February 2004, we agreed to pay a $7.5 million civil penalty, which was accrued for and expensed as of October 31, 2004.

Provision for Income Taxes

.

Income tax expense was $31,232 for fiscal 2004 as compared to $67,197 for fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower effective tax rate and decreased taxable income in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate was 32.3% for fiscal 2004, as compared to 40.6% for fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2004 tax provision included benefits from a change in the mix of earnings with a greater proportion of income from lower tax jurisdictions (3.9% decrease to the effective tax rate) and from the extraterritorial income benefit (ETI) (4.0% decrease to the effective tax rate) partially offset by the nondeductibility of the $7.5 million proposed SEC settlement (2.7% increase to the effective rate). The
fiscal 2003 tax provision included the effect of a valuation allowance against capital loss and other carryforwards (6.3% increase to the effective tax rate) partially offset by ETI (5.5% decrease to the effective tax rate).

At October 31, 2004, we had capital loss carryforwards totalling approximately $20,000. The capital loss carryforwards will expire in the periods fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008. Management does not expect to generate sufficient taxable income from capital transactions prior to the expiration of these benefits, and accordingly a valuation allowance was recorded in fiscal 2003 for this asset as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards will not be realized. At October 31, 2004, we had foreign net operating losses of approximately $11,000 expiring between 2005 and 2010, and state net operating losses of approximately $62,000 expiring between 2021 and 2023. If these losses are determined to not be
utilizable prior to expiration, additional valuation allowances may need to be recorded in future periods.

Recently enacted legislation generally provides that the ETI benefit described above will be reduced by 20% in 2005 and 40% in 2006, and will be eliminated in its entirety in 2007, which may result in higher future effective tax rates. Although this legislation also provides for future phased-in deductions for qualifying domestic production activities, we are presently unable to determine whether we will be able to realize any benefit from this provision. In addition, the legislation makes available a one-time 85% tax reduction with respect to repatriated foreign earnings through 2005. We do not believe that this provision will provide a material benefit to us.

We are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. We believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments.

Net Income

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are to fund the development, manufacturing and marketing of our published products and, to a lesser extent, the purchase of inventory for our distribution business. We satisfy our working capital requirements primarily through cash flow from operations. At October 31, 2005, we had working capital of $378,967 as compared to working capital of $407,914 at October 31, 2004. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $47,900 during fiscal 2005 as follows:

Operating Activities.

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005 was $39,980 compared to $20,458 for fiscal 2004. The increase is primarily due to the timing and collection of accounts receivable in fiscal 2005 and is reflected in the decrease in net accounts receivable of approximately $87,641 from October 31, 2004. The increase was primarily offset by lower net income, an increase in product development costs and the payment of a $7,500 fine in connection with an SEC settlement.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2005 was $91,034 compared to $64,422 for fiscal 2004. Net cash used in fiscal 2005 primarily reflects the acquisition of Visual Concepts and Kush, Gaia Capital Group, Irrational Studios LLC and certain intellectual property rights associated with

Civilization

and the prior year reflects the acquisitions of TDK, Indie, Mobius and Venom. During fiscal 2005, we also incurred capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements at our new warehouse facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio, new offices for our 2K publishing labels and expenditures related to the continued improvement of our software systems.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2005 was $6,223 as compared to $16,315 for fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to the repurchase of 925,341 shares of our common stock in 2005 at a cost of $24,929.

Significant Balance Sheet Changes:

The
    decrease of $89,952 in gross accounts receivable, before allowances, from
    October 31, 2004 to October 31, 2005, is primarily due to the timing of the
    release of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

in October 2004 and subsequent
    receivable collections.

Our allowances, which include doubtful accounts, returns, price concessions, rebates and other sales allowances, decreased slightly to $69,904 at October 31, 2005 from $72,215 at October 31, 2004 and increased as a percentage of receivables to 26.1% at October 31, 2005 from 20.2% at October 31, 2004. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of receivables is partly due to additional reserves at October 31, 2005 of approximately $7,714 recorded in anticipation of remaining product returns as a result of the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

by the ESRB in July 2005. At October 31, 2005, our allowances, excluding the additional reserves related to the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

, were approximately 23.3%
of gross accounts receivables. In addition, allowances as a percentage of receivables were lower at October 31, 2004 as a result of net revenues from a major product release,

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004 on which lower allowances were required.

As of October 31, 2005 and 2004, the receivable balances from our five largest customers were approximately 56.6% and 45.1% of our net receivable balance, respectively, with two customers accounting for 21.7% and 10.8% of such balance at October 31, 2005 as compared to two customers accounting for 12.8% and 11.2% of such balance at October 31, 2004.

Generally, we have been able to collect our receivables in the ordinary course of business. We do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers and our receivables are generally not covered by


Back to Index

insurance. However, from time to time we purchase insurance from financial institutions on our receivables, with certain limits, to help protect us from loss in the event of a customer’s bankruptcy or insolvency.

We are subject to credit risks, particularly in the event that any of the receivables represent a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets. If we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due, it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position and we would be required to increase our provision for doubtful accounts.

Inventories of $136,227 at October 31, 2005 decreased $18,118 from $154,345 at October 31, 2004, reflecting lower levels of publishing products. Accounts payable of $133,353 at October 31, 2005 decreased $30,608 from $163,961 at October 31, 2004 primarily due to the decrease in inventory levels.

Accrued expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in royalties payable under a royalty program based on product sales for certain of our internal development personnel due to the timing of a significant product release,

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

, in October 2004. The decrease was also due to the payment of a civil penalty in connection with an SEC settlement in fiscal 2005 of $7,500, which was accrued at October 31, 2004, offset by an increase in compensation and benefits which is primarily due to timing.

Loan Facilities:

On
    August 24, 2005, we entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase
    Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”), and terminated our credit agreement
    with Bank of America, N.A, which would have expired on August 28, 2005. The
    JPMorgan credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to $50,000 through
    the expiration of the agreement on August 23, 2006. Advances under the credit
    agreement bear interest at a rate of 0.25% to 0.75% over the bank’s
    prime rate, or at the Eurodollar rate plus 1.25% to 1.75% depending on our
    consolidated leverage ratio. We are required to pay a commitment fee to the
    bank equal to 0.25% of the unused loan balance and borrowings under the agreement
    are collateralized by certain of our assets. The credit agreement also contains
    financial and other covenants (including a consolidated asset coverage ratio)
    and prohibits us from paying cash dividends, merging or consolidating with
    another corporation, selling or acquiring assets (other than in the ordinary
    course of business), creating liens and incurring additional indebtedness.
    Available borrowings under the agreement are reduced by the amount of any
    outstanding stand-by letters of credit. At October 31, 2005, we had no borrowings
    or outstanding stand-by letters of credit under the credit agreement, and
    we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants.

In May 2005, our United Kingdom subsidiary renewed its credit facility agreement with Lloyds TSB Bank plc (“Lloyds”) under which Lloyds agreed to make available borrowings of up to approximately $23,000. Advances under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of 1.25% per annum over the bank’s base rate, and are guaranteed by us. Available borrowings under the agreement are reduced by the amount of outstanding guarantees. The facility expires on March 31, 2006. We had no outstanding guarantees and no borrowings under this facility as of October 31, 2005.

Capital Expenditures

:

We expect to spend an additional $5,000 in connection with the continued improvement of our network infrastructure and software systems for our domestic and international operations. We also expect to make additional capital expenditures of approximately $1,000 for leasehold improvements and equipment in our new warehouse facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio, $1,000 for leasehold improvements and equipment in our warehouse facilities in Toronto, Canada and a further $2,500 for leasehold improvements and equipment for several of our studios. As of the date of this report, we have no other material commitments for capital expenditures.

Common Stock:

In
    June and August 2005, we repurchased a total of 925,341 shares of common
    stock at an aggregate cost of $24,929. These shares were retired in August
    2005.

In July 2005, we modified a stock compensation arrangement and accepted for return 412,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, held by three employees with a fair market value at the original issuance date of approximately $9,350, for cash bonuses payable in the future. At the date of modification, 366,667 shares were fully vested and $8,311 of compensation expense had been previously recognized. The remaining unvested shares were forfeited and the additional compensation


Back to Index

expense of future cash bonuses of $1,039 is being recognized ratably as expense through February 2006. In October 2005, these shares were retired.

Legal and Accounting Expenses

:

We have incurred and may continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses in connection with pending regulatory and litigation matters.

Based on our currently proposed operating plans and assumptions, we believe that projected cash flow from operations and available cash resources, including amounts available under our line of credit, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. If our projected cash flow and available cash is insufficient to fund our operations or if our plans and assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to seek additional financing or curtail our diversification activities.

Licensing and Marketing Agreements:

Our license expense consists primarily of payments to licensors of intellectual properties under agreements which expire at various times through December 2012. As of October 31, 2005, we have minimum guaranteed licensing and marketing commitments of $345,760 outstanding under various licensing agreements of which $5,747 are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as the licensor does not have any significant performance obligation. Minimum guaranteed licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect our agreements with major sports leagues and players’ associations.

Software Development Agreements:

Our
    payments made to third-party developers include contractual advances and
    royalty payments under agreements which expire at various times through November
    2008. Assuming performance by third-party developers, we have aggregate outstanding
    commitments of $67,981 under various software development agreements at October
    31, 2005. We have also established an internal royalty program pursuant to
    which we pay royalties to certain of our development personnel based on product
    sales.

Lease Commitments:

Our
    offices and warehouse facilities are occupied under non-cancelable operating
    leases expiring at various times from April 2006 to September 2014. We also
    lease certain furniture, equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable leases
    expiring through November 2009. Aggregate minimum rental payments through
    applicable lease expirations are $101,248 at October 31, 2005. Rent expense
    amounted to $13,484, $9,713 and $7,445 for the years ended October 31, 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively.

Distribution Agreements:

We
    periodically enter into distribution agreements to purchase various software
    games that require minimum guaranteed payments. These agreements, which expire
    between December 2005 and January 2007, require remaining aggregate minimum
    guaranteed payments of $5,007 at October 31, 2005.

Contingent Consideration:

In
    fiscal 2005, in connection with the acquisition of Irrational, we agreed
    to make additional payments of $2,000 to the former owners of Irrational
    based on the delivery of products. We do not anticipate making these contingent
    payments within the next twelve months due to the expected timing of product
    releases. Additionally, in fiscal 2005, in connection with the acquisition


Back to Index

of Visual Concepts and Kush Games, the Company agreed to make additional payments of approximately $2,600 to SEGA based on the commercial release of products. The additional payments to SEGA are expected to be made in fiscal 2006.

In March 2005, we renegotiated a $6,000 contingent obligation due upon the delivery of the final PC version of

Duke Nukem Forever

through the payment of $4,250 and issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $500. The payment of the promissory note is contingent upon the commercial release of such product prior to December 31, 2006.

In fiscal 2004, in connection with the acquisition of Mobius, we agreed to make additional contingent payments of approximately $1,950 based on the delivery of products. In fiscal 2003, we also agreed to make additional payments of up to $2,500 to the former owners of Cat Daddy based on a percentage of Cat Daddy’s future profits for the first three years after acquisition. We do not anticipate making these contingent payments within the next twelve months.

Fluctuations in Operating Results and Seasonality

We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles; variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms; market acceptance of our titles; development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles; sequels or enhancements of existing titles; projected and actual changes in platforms; the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors; product returns; changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors; the size and timing of acquisitions; the timing of orders from major customers; order cancellations; and delays in product shipment. Sales of our titles are also seasonal, with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth
calendar quarter (our fourth and first fiscal quarters) as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season. Quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

International Operations

Net revenues in international markets, principally in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, net revenues in international markets accounted for approximately 32.0% and 27.5%, respectively, of our net revenues. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased credit risks, tariffs and duties, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, shipping delays and international political, regulatory and economic developments, all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

(Dollars in thousands)

We are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, primarily risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. Historically, fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results. At October 31, 2005, we had no outstanding variable rate indebtedness.

We transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into United States dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant fiscal quarter or year end. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. For fiscal 2005, our foreign currency translation adjustment loss was $5,668 and our foreign exchange transaction gain was $1,560. A hypothetical 10% change in applicable currency exchange rates at October 31, 2005 would result in a material translation adjustment.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2005. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As described below under Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we identified material weaknesses
in the
company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) as of October 31, 2005. As a result of the existence of these material weaknesses, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of October 31, 2005.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Back to Index

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO”).

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting described above, management has identified the following material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005:

•

The Company did not maintain effective controls over the existence and valuation of its accounts payable related to inventory purchases. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to identify, analyze and reconcile amounts related to inventory purchases included in accounts payable to underlying supporting documentation. This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005 annual consolidated financial statements. In addition, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the accounts payable, inventory or cost of goods accounts or related disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined
that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.

•

The Company did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy of the amortization of its capitalized software development costs. Specifically, the Company did not have effective controls to accurately prepare and review inputs to a spreadsheet application used to calculate amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs. This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005 annual consolidated financial statements. In addition, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the capitalized software development costs or amortization expense or related disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.

Management has concluded that, as a result of these material weaknesses, the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005, based on the criteria in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included on pages 50 and 51 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management’s Remediation
Initiatives

We have developed remediation plans and initiated action steps designed to address each of the material weaknesses in the internal control over financial reporting identified above and to implement appropriate corrective actions that are required to improve the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the enhancement of the Company’s policies, systems and procedures. Specifically, we are in the process of implementing the following measures to remediate the control deficiencies identified above:


Back to Index

•

Enhancing the design of the monthly account review process related to these account reconciliations to provide for supplementary detailed monthly review and documentation of account analyses by corporate management and Internal Audit.

•

Providing additional levels of review of accounting personnel work product through the use of consultants and will ensure additional personnel are hired.

•

Initiating a feasibility study regarding the development of a system to automate the calculation of our software development costs (asset) and the related expense.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and

Stockholders of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.’s 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated Financial Statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Also, we have audited management's
    assessment, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that
    the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of October 31, 2005, because the Company (i) did not maintain effective
    controls over the existence and valuation of its accounts payable related
    to inventory purchases and (ii) did not maintain effective controls over
    the accuracy of the amortization of its capitalized software development
    costs, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
    opinions on management's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide


Back to Index

reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.  The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment as of October 31, 2005:

•

The Company did not maintain effective controls over the existence and valuation of its accounts payable related to inventory purchases. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to identify, analyze and reconcile amounts related to inventory purchases included in accounts payable to underlying supporting documentation. This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005 annual consolidated financial statements. In addition, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the accounts payable, inventory or cost of goods accounts or related disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, management has determined
that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.

•

The Company did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy of the amortization of its capitalized software development costs. Specifically, the Company did not have effective controls to accurately prepare and review inputs to a spreadsheet application used to calculate amortization expense related to capitalized software development costs.  This control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the 2005 annual consolidated financial statements. In addition, this control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the capitalized software development costs or amortization expense or related disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.

These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, management's assessment that Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal control-Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.  Also, in our opinion, because of the effects of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO.

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

1.

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS

Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 1993. The Company develops, publishes and distributes interactive software games designed for personal computers, video game consoles and handheld platforms.

2.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and of entities for which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary as defined in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Certain amounts in the financial statements of the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of software development costs, licenses and intangibles, valuation of inventories, realization of deferred income taxes and the adequacy of allowances for returns, price concessions and doubtful accounts. Actual amounts could differ significantly from
these estimates.

Sales of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

in North America during fiscal 2005 were negatively impacted by the re-rating of this title from “M” to “AO” in July 2005. In July 2005, the Company initially recorded a provision of $32,637 for product returns as a result of the re-rating. The provision was subsequently reduced by approximately $8,154 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 due to better than expected sell-through of the product and lower processing costs related to product returns. The resulting impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations in fiscal 2005 was a reduction of $24.5 million, $5.9 million, $18.6 million and $18.6 million for net revenues, cost of goods sold, gross profit and
income from operations, respectively.

At October 31, 2005, the Company’s accounts receivable balance is net of reserves of approximately $7,714 for remaining product returns primarily related to the Company’s North American retail inventory of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

as a result of the re-rating.

Stock Split

In April 2005, the Company effected a three-for-two stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Accordingly, all share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto give retroactive effect to the stock split.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximates fair value because of their short maturities. The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


Back to Index

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies and has significant sales and purchase transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company uses forward exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency assets and liabilities, primarily certain intercompany receivables and payables. The Company does not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” As a result the Company marks to market its foreign currency forward contracts each period and any gains and losses are recognized in net income. At October 31, 2005, the Company has no outstanding foreign currency forward
contracts.

Concentration of Credit Risk

A significant portion of the Company’s cash balance is maintained with several major financial institutions. While the Company attempts to limit credit exposure with any single institution, there are times that balances will exceed insurable amounts.

If the financial condition and operations of the Company’s customers deteriorate, the risk of collection could increase substantially. As of October 31, 2005 and 2004, receivables from the Company’s five largest customers amounted to approximately 56.6% and 45.1% of the Company’s net receivable balance, respectively, with two customers accounting for 21.7% and 10.8% of such balance at October 31, 2005 and with two customers accounting for 12.8% and 11.2% of such balance at October 31, 2004. Except for the largest customers noted above, all receivable balances from the remaining individual customers are less than 10% of the Company’s net receivable balance.

Inventories, net

Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories and makes adjustments as necessary. Estimated product returns are included in the inventory balance at their cost.

Software Development Costs

The Company utilizes both internal development teams and third-party software developers to develop its products.

The Company capitalizes internal software development costs, as well as film production and other content costs, subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a title. Amortization of such costs as a component of cost of goods sold is recorded on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year net revenues to the total of current and estimated future net revenues for the title or the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software costs based on undiscounted future cash flows and charges to cost of goods sold any amounts that are deemed unrecoverable.

Agreements with third-party developers generally provide the Company with exclusive publishing and distribution rights and require the Company to make advance payments that are recouped against royalties due to the developer based on the contractual amounts of product sales, adjusted for certain costs. Advance payments are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and amortized as royalties in cost of goods sold on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the proportion of current year net revenues to the total of current and estimated future net revenues for that title or the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product net revenues as defined in the respective agreements. At each balance sheet date, the
Company evaluates the recoverability of advanced development payments and unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine the amounts unlikely to be realized through product sales. Advance payments are charged to cost of goods sold in the amount that management determines is unrecoverable in the period in which such determination is made or if management determines that it will cancel a development project. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales for a title include: historical


Back to Index

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

performance of comparable titles; orders for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Licenses

Licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to licensors of intellectual property rights. Agreements with certain licensors provide for minimum guaranteed payments for intellectual property licenses and other licensing rights which may be recouped against amounts due to the licensor or developer based on product net revenues. Minimum guaranteed payments are initially recorded as an asset (licenses) and as a liability (accrued licenses) at the contractual amount upon execution of the contract when no significant performance remains with the licensor. When significant performance remains with the licensor, the Company records payments when actually paid.

Licenses are amortized as royalties
    in cost of goods sold on a title-by-title basis based on the greater of the
    proportion of current year net revenues to the total of current and estimated
    future net revenues for that title or the contractual royalty rate based
    on actual net product sales as defined in the respective agreements. At each
    balance sheet date, the Company evaluates licenses as well as any unrecognized
    minimum commitments not yet paid to determine the amounts unlikely to be
    realized through product sales. License-based assets are charged to cost
    of goods sold in the amount that management determines is not probable of
    being recouped at the contractual royalty rate based on current and future
    net revenues in the period in which such determination is made. Criteria
    used to evaluate expected product performance and to estimate future sales
    for a title include: historical performance of comparable titles; orders
    for titles prior to release; and the estimated performance of a sequel title
based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based.

Property and Equipment

Office equipment, furniture and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated lives ranging from five to seven years. Computer equipment and software are depreciated using the straight-line method over three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or estimated useful lives. The cost of additions and betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations in the periods incurred. When depreciable assets are retired or sold, the cost and related allowances for depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. The carrying amounts of these assets are recorded at historical cost.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess purchase price paid over identified intangible and tangible net assets of acquired companies. Intangible assets consist of trademarks, intellectual property, non-compete agreements, customer lists and acquired technology. Certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized as assets apart from goodwill. Identifiable intangibles are amortized using the straight-line method over the period of expected benefit ranging from three to ten years, except for intellectual property, which is amortized based on the shorter of the useful life or expected revenue stream. Intangible assets with indefinite lives, if any, and goodwill are not amortized.

The Company performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill, in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analysis and compares such values to the respective reporting unit’s carrying amount. At October 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded the carrying amounts and no impairment was indicated.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews all long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. The Company compares the carrying amount of


Back to Index

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. The estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate or fair value, if available.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized after considering tax planning strategies, if applicable. No income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in those companies.

Revenue Recognition

The Company earns its revenue from the sale of internally developed interactive software titles and from the sale of titles developed by and/or licensed from third-party developers (“Publishing revenue”). The Company also earns revenue from the sale of interactive software titles published by third parties, hardware and accessories (“Distribution revenue”).

The Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to its customers. The Company applies the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition” in conjunction with the applicable provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.” Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for software titles when there is (1) persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists, which is generally a customer purchase order, (2) the software is delivered, (3) the selling price is fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable. The Company’s payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60-day
terms.

Revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns, price concessions and other allowances. In circumstances when the Company does not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or is unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable, it defers the revenue until such time as it can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable.

Allowances for Returns, Price Concessions and Other Allowances

The Company accepts returns and grants price concessions in connection with its publishing arrangements. Following reductions in the price of the Company’s products, it grants price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe the Company with respect to merchandise unsold by them. The Company’s customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions, including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels.

The Company’s distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders. However, the Company sometimes accepts returns from its distribution customers for stock balancing and makes accommodations to customers, which includes credits and returns, when demand for specific titles falls below expectations.

The Company makes estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue. The Company estimates the amount of future returns and price concessions for


Back to Index

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

published titles based upon, among other factors, historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres, historical performance of a hardware platform, customer inventory levels, analysis of sell-through rates, sales force and retail customer feedback, industry pricing, market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of its products by consumers.

Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period. The Company believes it can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions. However, actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, market conditions and assumptions. Adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.

Consideration Given to Customers and Received from Vendors

The Company has various marketing arrangements with retailers and distributors of its products that provide for cooperative advertising and market development funds, among others. Such amounts are accrued as a reduction to revenue when revenue is recognized, except for cooperative advertising which is included in selling and marketing expenses if there is a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit’s fair value can be established.

The Company also receives various incentives from its manufacturers. Such amounts are generally accounted for as a reduction in the price of the manufacturer’s product and included as a reduction of inventory or cost of goods sold, except where the incentive is in exchange for services rendered by the Company. Incentives in exchange for services are included in revenue providing there is an identifiable benefit to the vendor and the benefit’s value can be established.

Advertising

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 amounted to $101,077, $72,165 and $55,795, respectively.

Research and Development Expense

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. A substantial portion of research and development costs are capitalized once software development projects reach technological feasibility, which is relatively early in the development process, and subsequently amortized as cost of goods sold. See Note 7 “Software Development Costs.”

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB 25”). Under APB 25, generally no compensation expense is recorded when the terms of the award are fixed and the exercise price of the employee stock option equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payment” which revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” This statement supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” The revised statement addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations. The revised statement is effective as of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005.

The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) on November 1, 2005, as required, and has chosen the Modified Prospective Application (“MPA”) method for implementing SFAS 123(R). Under the MPA method, new awards will be valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption. Outstanding prior awards that are unvested as of October 31, 2005 will be recognized as compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. Prior periods will not be restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will reduce reported net income and earnings per share.

The Company currently estimates that income from operations in fiscal 2006 will be reduced by additional compensation expense of approximately $22.0 million to $25.0 million due to the adoption

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

of this Standard. The actual impact
    of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) in fiscal 2006 could differ from this estimate
    depending upon the number and timing of options granted during fiscal 2006,
    as well as their vesting period and vesting criteria. The Company’s
    assessment, which includes an estimate for future grants, is based on the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model and is affected by the Company’s
    stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective
    variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility
    of the Company’s stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors.
    As such, actual stock option expense may differ materially from this estimate.

Net
    Income per Share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the year by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net income applicable to common stockholders for the year by the weighted-average number of common and common stock equivalents, which include common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding during the year. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency for the Company’s foreign operations is primarily the applicable local currency. Accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and average prevailing exchange rates for the period for revenue and expense accounts. Adjustments resulting from translation are included in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized and unrealized transaction gains and losses are included in income in the period in which they occur, except on intercompany balances considered to be long term. Transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances considered to be long term are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of taxes. Foreign exchange
transaction gains included in net income for the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 amounted to $1,560, $1,199 and $2,015, respectively.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income adjusted for the change in foreign currency translation adjustments net of tax, if applicable, and the change in net unrealized gain (loss) from investments.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”), which replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements – An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28.” SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2005. Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS 154 will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 (“SFAS 153”), “Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets – an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,” to eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 is effective for non-monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153, effective August 1, 2005, had no impact on the Company’s financial statements.

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND CONSOLIDATION

The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as purchase transactions, accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of the acquired businesses are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. To the extent that the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions is preliminary, the Company does not expect that the final purchase price allocation will be materially different. With the exception of the acquisition of TDK in December 2003, the proforma impact of these acquisitions was not material.

2005 Transactions

In August 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Irrational Studios (“Irrational”), the developer of certain of the Company’s titles. The purchase price consisted of $4,212 in cash and $2,000 of restricted stock, which was payable at closing, $1,550 of development advances previously paid to Irrational and $2,000 of deferred consideration which is payable in equal amounts on the first and second anniversary dates of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $2,250 of identifiable intangible assets, $7,665 of goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, $187 of non-current assets and $340 of net current liabilities, on a preliminary basis.  The Company also
agreed to make additional payments of $2,000 based on the delivery of products which will be recorded as additional purchase price when the conditions requiring their payment are met.

In June 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Gaia Capital Group and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (“Gaia”), the developers of certain of the Company’s titles. The purchase price consisted of $5,748 in cash, $4,055 of development advances previously paid to Gaia and deferred consideration of $1,597.

to identifiable intangible assets, on a preliminary basis.

Pursuant to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”), the results of operations of Destineer Publishing Corp. (“Destineer”), a publisher of PC games, were consolidated in the Company’s financial statements effective November 1, 2003 through January 31, 2005. Effective February 1, 2005, the Company is no longer considered the primary beneficiary of Destineer nor does the Company hold a significant variable interest in Destineer. Accordingly, pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46(R), the results of Destineer’s operations are not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements subsequent to February 1, 2005. The consolidation of
Destineer did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2004 Transactions

In October 2004, the Company acquired
    certain assets from Microsoft, including Indie Built (“Indie”),
    the developer of

Top Spin

(tennis),

Amped

    at closing. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $5,828
    in identifiable intangible assets, $9,890 of goodwill, which is deductible
    for tax purposes, $280 of fixed assets, $1,317 of accounts receivable and

The amount of software development costs resulting from advance payments and guarantees to third-party developers was $48,104 and $36,537 at October 31, 2005 and October 31, 2004, respectively. Amounts due to third-party developers were previously classified as prepaid royalties in the Company’s 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements.

Software development costs at October 31, 2005 and 2004 included amounts of $77,544 and $49,304, respectively, related to titles that have not been released yet.

Previously, all internal software development costs in fiscal 2001 through 2004 were classified as long-term which was not consistent with the accounting for external software development costs which are classified as either current or non-current based on the expected current year net revenues to the total of current and estimated future net revenues related to the release of a video game title. In 2004 and 2003, internal software development costs of $16,380 and $9,652, respectively, were reclassified to short-term software development costs to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes.

LINES OF CREDIT

On August 24, 2005, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”), and terminated its credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. The JPMorgan credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to $50,000 through the expiration of the agreement on August 23, 2006. Advances under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate of 0.25% to 0.75% over the bank’s prime rate, or at the Eurodollar rate plus 1.25% to 1.75% depending on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the bank equal to

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

0.25% of the unused loan balance and borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by certain of the Company’s assets. The credit agreement also contains financial and other covenants (including a consolidated asset coverage ratio) and limits or prohibits the Company from paying cash dividends, merging or consolidating with another corporation, selling or acquiring assets (other than in the ordinary course of business), creating liens and incurring additional indebtedness. Available borrowings under the agreement are reduced by the amount of any outstanding stand-by letters of credit. The Company had no borrowings or stand-by letters of credit under the credit agreement and was in compliance with all financial and other covenants at
October 31, 2005.

In May 2005, the Company’s United Kingdom subsidiary renewed its credit facility agreement with Lloyds TSB Bank plc (“Lloyds”) under which Lloyds agreed to make available borrowings of up to approximately $23,000. Advances under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of 1.25% per annum over the bank’s base rate, and are guaranteed by the Company. Available borrowings under the agreement are reduced by the amount of outstanding guarantees. The facility expires on March 31, 2006. The Company had no outstanding guarantees and no borrowings under this facility as of October 31, 2005.

LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS

Following the re-rating of

Grand
      Theft Auto: San Andreas

by
    the Entertainment Software Rating Board (“ESRB”) from “M” (age
    17 and over) rating to an “AO” (age 18 and over) rating in July
    2005, the Company was notified by the staff of the Federal Trade Commission’s
    (“FTC”) Division of Advertising Practices that it is conducting
    an inquiry into advertising claims made for the title and whether the Company
    engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of section
    5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C., Section 45. The Company
    is cooperating with the FTC inquiry and believes that it acted in accordance
    with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company
    cannot predict the outcome of this pending matter, which could result in
    the imposition of significant fines and penalties.

In January 2006, the City Attorney
    for the City of Los Angeles filed a complaint against the Company and its
    subsidiary, Rockstar Games, Inc. (“Rockstar”), in the Superior
    Court of the State of California. The complaint alleges that the Company
    and Rockstar violated sections of
    the California Business and Professions Code prohibiting untrue and misleading
    statements and unfair competition and that the Company and Rockstar were
    unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure to disclose that

Grand
    Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content which should
    have resulted in the game receiving an Adults Only (“AO”) rating
    from the ESRB rather than a Mature (“M”) rating. The complaint
    also alleges that the Company made misleading statements as to the origin
    of the “hidden” content. The complaint seeks injunctive relief,
    restitution for
    purchasers
    of the game and civil
    fines. The Company believes that the allegations in the City Attorney’s
    complaint are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against these
    claims. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of this action and,
    if determined adversely to the Company, such action could have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. The Company has
    also received requests for documents and information from the Attorneys General
    of the
    States of
    North
    Carolina
    and
    Connecticut
    relating
    to

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

.

In July 2005 the Company received
    three purported class action complaints against the Company and its subsidiary,
    Rockstar, which were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (the “New York Actions”) and one such complaint which was filed in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the “Pennsylvania Action”). On September 8, 2005, another similar complaint was filed in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial District, St. Clair County, Illinois (the “Illinois Action”). The plaintiffs; alleged purchasers of

the Company’s

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

game, allege that the Company and Rockstar engaged in consumer deception, false advertising and common law fraud and were unjustly enriched as a result of the alleged failure of the Company and Rockstar to disclose that

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

contained “hidden” content, which resulted in the game receiving an “M” rating from the ESRB rather than an “AO” rating. The complaints seek unspecified damages, declarations of various violations of law and litigation costs. The New York Actions and the Pennsylvania Action have been consolidated in the Southern District of New York under the caption

In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer

Litigation, (05-CV-6734 (BSJ)). The Illinois Action has been removed to the United
    States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, and the Company
    has moved the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for an order transferring
    the Illinois Action to the Southern District of New York for coordinated
    or consolidated proceedings with the actions pending in New York. The Company
    believes these complaints are without merit and intends to vigorously defend
    and seek dismissals of these actions. However, the Company cannot predict
    the outcome of these actions and, if determined adversely to the Company,
    such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results
of operations.

In February 2005, the personal representatives of the Estates of Arnold Strickland and Ace Mealer brought an action in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Alabama against the Company, Sony Computer of America, Wal-Mart, GameStop and Devin Moore alleging under Alabama’s manufacturers’ liability and wrongful death statutes that the Company’s video games designed, manufactured, marketed and/or supplied to Mr. Moore resulted in “copycat violence” that caused the death of Messrs. Strickland and Mealer. The suit seeks damages (including punitive damages) against all of the defendants in excess of $600 million. Wal-Mart and Sony Computer of America have tendered their defense and requested indemnification from the Company,
and the Company has accepted such tender. The Company’s motion to dismiss the action was denied and the Company moved to have certain issues certified for an immediate interlocutory appeal before the Alabama Supreme Court.  The Company believes the complaint is without merit and intends to vigorously defend and seek dismissal of this action. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of this action and, if determined adversely to the Company, such action could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

The Company has been advised that
    a purported class action has been filed in the Southern District of New York
    on behalf of St. Clair Shore General Employees Retirement System and other
    similarly situated plaintiffs against the Company and certain individuals
    alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act regarding purported breaches
    of fiduciary duty and illegal insider trading. The Company has not been served
    in the action and not yet obtained or reviewed a copy of the complaint. The
    Company cannot predict the outcome of this action.

In January 2006, a proceeding was commenced in Delaware Chancery Court (

Veek v. Take-Two
Interactive Software, Inc.)

seeking to compel the Company to produce certain books and records pursuant to Section 220 of
Delaware Corporation Law in connection with

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

. The Company cannot predict the outcome
of this action.

The Company is involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of its business, which in management’s opinion will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Licensing and Marketing Agreements:

The Company’s license expense consists primarily of payments made to licensors for intellectual property rights under agreements which expire at various times through December 2012. As of October 31, 2005, the Company has minimum guaranteed licensing and marketing commitments of $345,760 outstanding, of which $5,747 is recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as the licensor does not have any significant performance obligation to the

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Company. Minimum guaranteed licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect the Company’s agreements with major sports leagues and players’ associations.

Software Development Agreements:

The
    Company’s payments made to third-party software developers include
    contractual advances and royalties under agreements which expire at various
    times through November 2008. Assuming performance by third-party developers,
    the Company has aggregate outstanding commitments of $67,981 under various
    software development agreements at October 31, 2005. The Company has also
    established an internal royalty program pursuant to which it pays royalties
    to its Rockstar development personnel based on product sales.

Lease Commitments

: The Company’s office and warehouse facilities are occupied under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various times from April 2006 to September 2014. The Company also leases certain furniture, equipment and automobiles under non-cancelable leases expiring through November 2009. Some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease. The effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term. Aggregate minimum rental payments through applicable lease expirations are $101,248 at October 31, 2005. Rent expense amounted to $13,484, $9,713 and $7,445 for the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Distribution Agreements:

The Company periodically enters into distribution agreements to purchase various software games. These agreements, which expire between December 2005 and January 2007, require remaining aggregate minimum guaranteed payments of $5,007 at October 31, 2005.

Contingent Consideration:

In fiscal 2005, in connection with the acquisition of Irrational, the Company agreed to make additional payments of $2,000 to the former owners of Irrational based on the delivery of products. The Company does not anticipate making these contingent payments within the next twelve months. Additionally, in fiscal 2005, in connection with the acquisition of Visual Concepts and Kush Games, the Company agreed to make additional payments of approximately $2,600 to SEGA based on the commercial release of products. The additional payments to SEGA are expected to be made in fiscal 2006.

In March 2005, the Company renegotiated a $6,000 contingent obligation due upon delivery of the final PC version of

Duke Nukem Forever

through the payment of $4,250 and issuance of a promissory note in the principal amount of $500. The payment of the promissory note is contingent upon the commercial release of such product prior to December 31, 2006.

In connection with the acquisition of Mobius in March 2004, the Company agreed to make additional contingent payments of approximately $1,950 based on the delivery of products. In fiscal 2003, the Company agreed to make additional payments of up to $2,500 to the former owners of Cat Daddy based on a percentage of Cat Daddy’s future profits for the first three years after acquisition. The Company does not anticipate making these contingent payments within the next twelve months.

Other:

The ESRB requires publishers to conduct
    pertinent content audit certifications with respect to certain top selling
    titles, the objective of which is to assess what portion, if any, of the
    games on the market include undisclosed pertinent content on the disc that
    undermines the accuracy of the ESRB rating. This self audit procedure applies
    to certain current titles and may be applied to additional titles in the
    future. The Company is currently conducting a self audit in accordance with
    the ESRB’s requirements. It is possible that there may be content in the
    Company’s games that could be determined to be pertinent content that
    causes a change to the current ESRB rating. In such event, the Company may
    be required to record a reserve for anticipated product returns and inventory
    obsolescence which could expose the Company to additional litigation, administrative
    fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and could adversely affect
    the Company’s operating results.

The lower annual effective tax rate for 2005 is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, with a greater proportion of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions, and a loss being generated in higher tax jurisdictions.

In accordance with FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes”, the allocation of the valuation allowance between gross current and non-current deferred tax assets was made by jurisdiction, on a pro rata basis and is not classified based solely on the item to which it relates.

At October 31, 2005, the Company had capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $26,800. The capital loss carryforwards will expire in the periods fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008. Management does not expect to generate sufficient taxable income from capital transactions prior to the expiration of these benefits, and accordingly a valuation allowance of $10,200 has been recorded for this asset as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards will not be realized.

At October 31, 2005, the Company had foreign net operating losses of approximately $10,000 expiring between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2010, and state net operating losses of approximately $93,000 expiring between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2026. Management does not expect to generate sufficient taxable income in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in future years to fully utilize the net operating loss carryforwards before expiration, and accordingly valuation allowances have been recorded for these assets in the amounts of $3,200 and $6,000, respectively.

The total amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries was approximately $166,000 and $111,000 for the years ended October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. It is the Company’s intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and thereby indefinitely postpone their remittance. Accordingly, no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or United States income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are paid as dividends to the Company.

The Company is regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities. Audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments. Additionally, the Company believes that any assessments in excess of the amounts provided for will not have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

16.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

In January 2003, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $25,000 of the Company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In June and August 2005, the Company repurchased 925,341 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $24,929. All shares repurchased were retired in August 2005.

TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

In July 2005, the Company modified a stock compensation arrangement and accepted for return 412,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, held by three employees with a fair market value at the original issuance date of approximately $9,350, for cash bonuses payable in the future. At the date of modification, 366,667 shares were fully vested and $8,311 of compensation expense had been previously recognized. The remaining unvested shares were forfeited and the additional compensation expense of future cash bonuses of $1,039 is being recognized ratably as expense through February 2006. In October 2005, 412,500 common shares under this arrangement were retired.

In November 2003, at a special meeting, the Company’s stockholders voted to amend the certificate of incorporation to increase the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares.

17.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN

The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement savings plan and trust (the “401(k) Plan”). The 401(k) Plan is offered to all eligible employees and participants may make voluntary contributions. The Company began matching contributions in July 2002. The matching contribution expense incurred by the Company during the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $864, $583 and $384, respectively.

18.

STOCK-BASED PLANS

Incentive Stock Plan

The Incentive Stock Plan (“Incentive Plan”) was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 12, 2003 and approved by stockholders in June 2004. The Incentive Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock, deferred stock and other stock-based awards of the Company’s common stock to directors, officers and other employees of the Company. The cost of restricted shares granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which ranges from one to four years. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. In June 2005, the stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate amount of shares to 2,500,000 shares from 1,500,000 shares.

Restricted shares granted under the plan and the weighted average fair value of the shares for the years ended October 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was as follows:

Stock Option Plans

In June 2002, the stockholders of the Company approved the Company’s 2002 Stock Option Plan, as previously adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “2002 Plan”), pursuant to which officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company may receive stock options to purchase shares of Common Stock. In June 2005, the stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate amount of shares to 11,000,000 shares from 9,000,000 shares.

In January 1997, the stockholders of the Company approved the Company’s 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended, as previously adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “1997 Plan”), pursuant to which officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Company may receive options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,500,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. As of April 30, 2002, there are no options available for grant under the 1997 Plan.

Subject to the provisions of the plans, the Board of Directors or any Committee appointed by the Board of Directors, has the authority to determine the individuals to whom the stock options are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each option, the option price, the type of option, the option period, restrictions, if any, on the exercise of the option, the terms for the payment of the option price and other terms and conditions.

As of October 31, 2005 and 2004, the plans had outstanding stock options in the aggregate of 6,691,000 and 5,441,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, respectively, vesting at various times from 2006 to 2009 and expiring at various times from 2006 to 2010. Options granted generally vest over a period of three to five years.

Non-Plan Stock Options

As of October 31, 2005 and 2004, there are non-plan stock options outstanding for an aggregate of 804,000 and 2,026,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, respectively. The non-plan stock options outstanding at October 31, 2005 vest from 2006 to 2007 and expire at various times from 2006 to 2009.

For those options with exercise prices less than fair value of the underlying shares at the measurement date, the difference is recorded as deferred compensation and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

CONSOLIDATION OF DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES

In January 2003, based on management’s strategy to consolidate the Company’s distribution business and after taking into account the relative cost savings involved, the Company closed its warehouse operations in Ottawa, Illinois and College Point, New York. Operations at these warehouses ceased by January 31, 2003 and the business conducted there was consolidated with the operations of the Company’s Jack of All Games distribution facility in Ohio.

As a result of the closures, the Company recorded a charge in fiscal 2003 of $7,028 which was included in general and administrative expenses. The charge related to lease termination costs, disposition of fixed assets, other exit costs and an impairment charge with respect to an intangible asset. Cash payments and asset write-offs of $7,028 were incurred by the Company in fiscal 2003 and there was no remaining obligation at October 31, 2003.

Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, quarterly computations of earnings per share must stand on their own and, therefore, the sum of basic and diluted EPS numbers for each of the four quarters of 2005 and 2004 may not equal full year basic and diluted EPS. Basic and diluted EPS for each quarter of 2005 and 2004 is

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the quarter, while basic and diluted EPS for the full year is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the more extended period of time.

In
        2005, in connection with an SEC settlement, the Company paid a $7.5 million
        civil penalty, which the Company accrued for and expensed in the fourth
    quarter of 2004.

(3)

In
        the 3

rd

quarter 2005, net revenues and gross profit were reduced
        by estimated provisions of approximately $32.6 million and $29.6 million,
        respectively, primarily due to additional product returns and processing
        costs as a result of the re-rating of

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas

by
        the Entertainment Software Rating Board (“ESRB”) in July
        2005. In the 4

th

quarter 2005, the provisions were reduced
        due to better than expected sell-through of the product and lower processing
        costs which increased 4

th

quarter net revenues and gross profit
    by $8.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively.
