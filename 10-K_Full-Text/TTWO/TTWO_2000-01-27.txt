Item 1. Business.

General

     We  are  a  leading  worldwide  developer,  publisher  and  distributor  of
interactive  software  games.  Our  software  operates  on  multimedia  personal
computers and video game console  platforms  manufactured by Sony,  Nintendo and
Sega. We are one of the largest  distributors  of interactive  software games in
the United  States and one of the top ten  publishers  of  interactive  software
games in Europe.

     Software is developed by our internal development studios, by developers in
which we have an ownership interest and by third-party developers on our behalf.
Our  relationships  with developers  include  Gathering of Developers and Bungie
Software.   We  have  several  titles  under  development  for  next  generation
platforms, such as the PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast.

     We publish our software under the Rockstar Games,  Talonsoft,  Gathering of
Developers, Mission Studios and Take-Two labels. We have released popular titles
in a variety of genres,  including Grand Theft Auto,  GTA2,  Railroad Tycoon II,
Monster Truck Madness and Thrasher:  Skate & Destroy,  and intend to release new
titles,  including Oni and Halo and titles based on the highly  successful  Duke
Nukem franchise and Austin Powers movies.

     Jack of All Games,  our  subsidiary,  distributes  our  software as well as
third-party  software to more than 20,000 retail  outlets in the United  States.
Our customers include WalMart, Toys R Us, Electronics Boutique,  Babbage's, Best
Buy and Ames Department  Stores,  as well as leading  national and regional drug
store, supermarket and discount store chains and specialty retailers.

     We also have publishing and distribution  operations in the United Kingdom,
France,  Germany,  Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Australia and Canada. We have
employed the Jack of All Games trade name in Europe,  and have greatly  expanded
our  international   presence  by  making  several  acquisitions.   Our  Joytech
subsidiary  is a leading  manufacturer  of video game  hardware  accessories  in
Europe.

     Our  objective  is  to  become  the  global   leader  in  the   interactive
entertainment software industry by:

     o    capitalizing  on  management's  expertise in  identifying  potentially
          significant  opportunities  arising out of the  convergence  of motion
          picture,  television and music  entertainment  media with  interactive
          software;

     o    developing a portfolio of strong game content for both PC and evolving
          console markets,  particularly for emerging next generation  platforms
          with potential for significant market penetration;

     o    establishing  brand  recognition  and  consumer  awareness,  including
          through our Rockstar Games label,  which has special appeal to today's
          youth culture and provides cross promotional opportunities;

     o    expanding  and   diversifying  our  integrated   global   development,
          publishing and  distribution  operations  through  internal growth and
          acquisition; and



                                      -2-


     o    developing     multi-player     online     gaming     and     pursuing
          business-to-business distribution opportunities via the Internet.


Industry Overview

     The market  for  interactive  software  games has grown  rapidly.  Steadily
declining  hardware  prices and more  powerful and realistic  computer  graphics
combined with broadening  consumer  demographics have resulted in greater demand
for software and increasing game play by audiences of all ages. According to the
NPD Group  (NPD),  sales of  interactive  software  games in the  United  States
reached $5.6 billion in 1999, an increase of 15.2% from $4.9 billion in 1998. We
believe  that the  industry  will  continue  to grow  largely  as a result of an
increasing  installed  base of PCs,  video game console  platforms and hand-held
systems, such as the Nintendo GameBoy Color.

     Increasing Sales of PC Systems.  The  International  Data Corporation (IDC)
estimates that approximately 56 million households in the United States will own
a PC by 2002,  representing a penetration rate of 53% of total  households.  The
increase in  penetration  and sales of PCs has resulted in greater demand for PC
entertainment software.  According to NPD, sales of PC entertainment software in
the United States were $1.4 billion in 1999 as compared to $1.2 billion in 1998.

     Increasing Sales of Video Console Platforms.  Three  manufacturers of video
console  platforms,  Sony,  Nintendo  and Sega,  dominate  the  console  market.
According  to IDC,  console  shipments  in the United  States grew 14% from 15.3
million  units in 1997 to 17.5  million  units in 1998.  Increased  shipments of
video  console  systems  have  resulted  in rapid  growth  of  console  software
revenues.  According  to NPD data,  sales of  entertainment  software  for video
console  platforms and portable systems  increased by 13.5% from $3.7 billion in
1998 to $4.2 billion in 1999.

     Expanding  Distribution  Channels.  Interactive  software  games  are  sold
primarily  through  specialty  retailers  such as  Electronics  Boutique,  major
retailers such as Best Buy and mass merchants such as Wal-Mart. The introduction
of budget  software  priced at less than $20 has  attracted a broader user base,
and non-traditional retail outlets such as drugstore and supermarket chains have
emerged as important new distribution channels for our products.

     Technology and Platform Shifts. Historically, the interactive entertainment
software  industry  has  experienced  periods of  instability  when new  console
platforms fail to gain  widespread  market  acceptance or when  development  and
publishing  companies  fail to  quickly  adapt  to  changing  consumer  hardware
preferences.  Sony has announced the next  generation  of the  PlayStation  game
console,  the  PlayStation  2,  which it plans to  introduce  in 2000.  Sega has
recently  introduced  its  Dreamcast  system and  Nintendo has stated that it is
developing a new platform.  As a result, game publishers may be required to make
investments  in  research,  game  development  and  inventory in order to supply
products for new platforms.  We believe that the  substantial  installed base of
multimedia  PCs, the mass market appeal and expanding  user base of  interactive
software games and the increasing use of cost-effective CD-ROMs may diminish the
effects of future console platform shifts. In addition,  Sony has announced that
PlayStation   2  will  be  the  first  console   system  to  feature   backwards
compatibility  with  existing  software,  allowing  consumers  to play their old
PlayStation  games on the new  system.  This  feature  may  lessen the impact of
console shifts by extending the useful life of older software titles.

Releases

     We actively seek to release titles with potential for mass appeal.  For the
year ended October 31, 1998,  Grand Theft Auto sold more than 630,000 copies and
accounted for approximately 7.6% of our revenues. For the year ended October 31,
1999,  GTA2  shipped  more than one  million  copies and with  Grand  Theft Auto
accounted for approximately 10.3% and 6.1%,  respectively,  of our revenues. The
following are certain titles we have released:





                                      -4-


Publishing and Distribution Arrangements

     Agreements with Gathering of Developers

     We have entered into  distribution  agreements with Gathering of Developers
("Gathering"),  a group of six premier entertainment software developers, Ritual
Entertainment,  Inc., Epic  MegaGames,  Inc.,  Terminal  Reality,  Inc.,  Apogee
Software,  Inc. d/b/a 3D Realms, Poptop Software, Inc. and Edge of Reality, Inc.

also obtained certain rights for console versions of these products,  as well as
new products developed by Bungie.

     Agreements with Video Game Console Manufacturers

     In February and March 1999, we entered into four-year  agreements with Sony
Computer  Entertainment America and Sony Computer  Entertainment Europe granting
us  non-exclusive  licenses to develop and publish  software for the PlayStation
platform.  Under  the  agreements,  Sony is the  exclusive  manufacturer  of all
CD-ROMs for PlayStation  titles. In June 1999, we entered into an agreement with
Sony in connection  with our use of development  tools for titles  developed for
the PlayStation 2 platform.

     In February  1998, we entered into a three-year  agreement with Nintendo of
America Inc.  granting us a  non-exclusive  license in North,  Central and South
America to develop and publish  software for the  Nintendo 64  platform.  In May
1998,  Nintendo Co., Ltd. entered into a similar  three-year  agreement with our
subsidiary,   Take-Two   Interactive  Software  Europe  Limited  granting  us  a
non-exclusive  license  in Europe,  Australia  and New  Zealand  to develop  and
publish software for the Nintendo 64 platform. In April 1998, we entered into an
agreement with Nintendo granting us a non-exclusive  license to develop software
for the Nintendo GameBoy and GameBoy Color portable game systems.

     In March 1999,  we entered into an agreement  with Sega  Enterprises,  Ltd.
granting us a non-exclusive license to develop and publish software for the Sega
Dreamcast platform.

     We are not  required  to obtain any license to develop  titles  designed to
operate on PCs.

     Other Publishing and Distribution Arrangements

     In March 1998, we acquired certain publishing and distribution  rights from
BMG Entertainment  North America, a division of BMG Music,  including (1) all of
BMG's  right,  title  and  interest  to  Grand  Theft  Auto,  (2) the  worldwide
publishing and  distribution  rights and  intellectual  property rights to Space
Station:  Silicon  Valley for the  Nintendo 64 gaming  system,  (3) the European

Hasbro Interactive.

Internal Software Development

     We engage in  software  development  activities  through  our  wholly-owned
United States  development  subsidiaries,  Talonsoft,  a developer of historical
military  strategy  games,  Mission  Studios,  a developer of flight  simulation
games, Alternative Reality Technologies and GearHead Entertainment. In addition,
we engage in development  activities through our United Kingdom subsidiary,  DMA
Design Limited, the developer of the Grand Theft Auto series. We also maintain a
development  studio focusing on games for the Nintendo GameBoy Color platform in
the United  Kingdom  under the name  Tarantula.  As of  October  31,  1999,  our
internal  development  studios and product  development  department employed 230
development personnel with the technical capabilities to develop software titles
for all major game platforms.

     Our  production  process is  designed  to enable us to manage  and  control
development,  production  budgets and timetables,  identify and address possible
production  and  technical   issues  and  coordinate  and  implement   marketing
strategies in a creative  environment.  We utilize an integrated  scheduling and
production process and software development tools, which include capabilities to
produce  cinematic  quality  movie  sequences,  full  motion  digital  video and
enhanced "real-time" 3-D graphics.  We believe that our production  capabilities
permit us to produce high quality software on a timely and cost-effective basis.

     For the years ended October 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997, we incurred  costs of
$5,262,708,  $1,702,339 and $1,847,970 on research and  development  relating to
our software titles.

Marketing, Sales and Distribution

     Our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and
broaden  distribution  of our titles,  promote  brand name  recognition,  assist
retailers and properly  position,  package and merchandise our titles. We market
titles by implementing  aggressive public relations  campaigns,  primarily using
print and on-line advertising and to a lesser extent television and radio spots.
Print advertisements are placed in industry magazines using memorable tag lines,
visually  appealing  full color  artwork and  creative  concepts to position and
distinguish  our  titles  in the  marketplace.  We  also  employ  various  other
marketing  methods designed to promote consumer  awareness,  including  in-store
promotions and point-of-purchase displays, direct mail, cooperative advertising,
attendance at trade shows,  as well as the use of distinctive  packaging.  As of
October 31, 1999, we had a sales and marketing staff of 115 persons.



                                      -6-


     We  distribute   our  own  titles  and   third-party   titles  through  our
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Take-Two Interactive Software Europe Limited, Jack of
All Games,  DirectSoft,  L.D.A.  Distribution  Limited,  Funsoft Nordic A.S., CD
Verte Italia Spa and Take-Two  Interactive  Software  Canada,  Ltd. For the year
ended  October  31,  1999,  the  sale  of  third-party  products  accounted  for
approximately  47.6% of our revenues,  with sales to Ames Department  Stores and
Electronic Boutique accounting for approximately 9.9% and 4.1%, respectively, of
our revenues. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues.

     United States Sales. We distribute  interactive  entertainment  software to
over 20,000 retail outlets in the United States through third-party distributors
and through  direct  relationships  with large retail  customers.  Our customers
include WalMart, Toys R Us, Electronics Boutique,  Babbage's,  Best Buy and Ames
Department  Stores  as  well  as  leading  national  and  regional  drug  store,
supermarket and discount store chains and specialty retailers.

     International  Sales.  We have  significantly  expanded  our  international
presence  through the acquisition of publishing and  distribution  operations in
the United Kingdom,  France, Germany,  Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Australia
and Canada.  We  distribute  interactive  entertainment  software to over 20,000
retail  outlets in Europe  through third party  distributors  and through direct
relationships with retail customers.

     Rockstar   Games.   We  actively  pursue   marketing   relationships   with
participants in media  industries  such as music,  magazines and sports aimed at
the youth  market  through our console  publishing  label,  Rockstar  Games.  We
believe  that the shared  demographics  among  various  media and certain of our
software titles marketed by Rockstar Games provide  excellent cross  promotional
opportunities.  We have been working with popular and emerging recording artists
to create  sophisticated  game  soundtracks,  have  entered into  agreements  to
license  high-profile  names and likenesses,  and have entered into  co-branding
arrangements.  Our goal is to  accelerate  consumer  acceptance of our titles by
creating brand awareness.

Manufacturing

     Our  production  of PC  software  includes  CD-ROM  pressing,  assembly  of
components,  printing of  packaging  and user  manuals and  shipping of finished
goods,  which  is  performed  by  third-party  vendors  in  accordance  with our
specifications and forecasts.  We believe that there are alternative sources for
these  services  that  could  be  implemented  without  delay.  However,  we are
dependent on Nintendo to provide  supplies of video game  cartridges and on Sony
to provide  supplies of CD-ROMs for use on their video game platforms.  Nintendo
cartridges  are more  expensive  to  manufacture  than  CD-ROMs,  resulting in a
greater  inventory  risk for those games.  We purchase  titles  manufactured  by
Nintendo and Sony by placing  purchase orders in the ordinary course of business
and by obtaining  letters of credit in favor of Nintendo.  We send software code
and a prototype of a title,  together with related artwork,  user  instructions,
warranty  information,  brochures and  packaging  designs to  manufacturers  for
approval, defect testing and manufacturing.  Titles are generally shipped within
two weeks of receipt of order.  Titles  manufactured  by Nintendo are  generally
shipped  within  four to six weeks of  receipt  of order.  To date,  we have not
experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our titles
or material  delays due to title  defects.  Our  software  titles carry a 90-day
limited   warranty.   In  addition,   our  subsidiary   Joytech  Europe  Limited
manufactures video game accessories and peripherals in Hong Kong and China.

Competition

     We compete  both for  licenses to  properties  and the sale of  interactive
entertainment  software  with  Sony,  Nintendo  and  Sega,  each of which is the
largest developer and marketer of software for its platforms.  Sony and Nintendo
currently  dominate the industry and have the  financial  resources to withstand
significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising  campaigns,
particularly for prime-time  television spots. These companies may also increase
their own software development efforts.



                                      -7-


     We  also  compete  with  domestic   companies  such  as  Electronic   Arts,
Activision,  GT Interactive,  Acclaim Entertainment,  THQ, Midway Games, Hasbro,
Microsoft and Mattel and  international  companies  such as  Infogrames,  Eidos,
Capcom,  Konami and Namco. In addition, we believe that large software companies
and media companies are increasing their focus on the interactive  entertainment
software  market.  Many of our  competitors are developing  on-line  interactive
games and interactive networks that will compete with our software.  Many of our
competitors have far greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources
than we do, and many are able to carry larger inventories, adopt more aggressive
pricing  policies  and make  higher  offers  to  licensors  and  developers  for
commercially desirable properties than we can.

     Interactive  entertainment  software  distribution  channels have undergone
rapid  change in recent  years,  including  financial  difficulties  of  certain
retailers and the emergence of new channels for distribution of software such as
mass merchandisers,  other retail outlets and the Internet. An increasing number
of companies and new market entrants are competing for access to these channels.

     Retailers typically have limited shelf space and promotional resources, and
competition  is  intense  among  an  increasing   number  of  newly   introduced
entertainment  software  titles and hardware for adequate  levels of shelf space
and  promotional  support.  Competition  for retail  shelf  space is expected to
increase,  which may require us to increase our marketing  expenditures  just to
maintain current levels of sales of our titles.  Competitors with more extensive
lines  and  popular  titles  frequently  have  greater   bargaining  power  with
retailers.  Accordingly, we may not be able to achieve the levels of support and
shelf space that such competitors receive. Similarly, as competition for popular
properties  increases,  our cost of acquiring  licenses for such  properties  is
likely to increase,  possibly  resulting  in reduced  margins.  Prolonged  price
competition,  increased licensing costs or reduced operating margins would cause
our profits to decrease significantly.

     Competition  for our  titles is  influenced  by the  timing of  competitive
product  releases  and the  similarity  of such  products  to our titles and may
result in loss of shelf space or a reduction  in  sell-through  of our titles at
retail stores. Our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as
motion  pictures,  television and audio and video  cassettes  featuring  similar
themes,  on-line computer programs and forms of entertainment  which may be less
expensive or provide other advantages to consumers.

Intellectual Property

     We develop  proprietary  software and  technologies  and have  obtained the
rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties. We attempt
to protect our software and production techniques under copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws as well as through  contractual  restrictions  on  disclosure,
copying and  distribution.  We generally  do not hold any patents or  registered
copyrights.

     Interactive  entertainment software is susceptible to unauthorized copying.
Unauthorized third parties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our titles
to  obtain  and use  programming  or  production  techniques  that we  regard as
proprietary.   In  addition,   our  competitors  could   independently   develop
technologies substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies.

     As the amount of interactive entertainment software in the market increases
and the  functionality  of this  software  further  overlaps,  we  believe  that
interactive  entertainment  software  will  increasingly  become the  subject of
claims that such software  infringes the  copyrights or patents of others.  From
time to time, we receive  notices from third parties  alleging  infringement  of
their proprietary  rights.  Although we believe that our titles and technologies
and the titles and  technologies  of third-party  developers and publishers with
whom we have  contractual  relationships do not and will not infringe or violate
proprietary  rights of others,  it is possible that  infringement of proprietary
rights of others may occur. Any claims of  infringement,  with or without merit,
could be time-consuming, costly and difficult to defend.



                                      -8-


Employees

     As of  December  31,  1999,  we had 535  full-time  employees.  None of our
employees  are subject to a  collective  bargaining  agreement.  We consider our
relations with employees to be good.

Item 2. Properties.

Executive Offices

     Our  principal  executive  and  administrative  office  is  located  at 575
Broadway, New York, New York in approximately 13,300 square feet of office space
under a five-year lease with 575 Broadway  Corporation,  a company controlled by
Peter Brant, a principal stockholder.  We pay $410,000 per year rent. We believe
that the terms of the lease are no less  favorable  than  those  that could have
been obtained from an unaffiliated third-party.

International Operations

     Take-Two  Interactive  Software Europe Limited leases 12,500 square feet of
office space in Windsor, United Kingdom. The lease provides for a current annual
rent of (pound)275,000  (approximately  $452,000) plus taxes and utilities,  and

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

     Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995:  The  statements  contained  herein  which  are not  historical  facts are
forward-looking  statements that involve risks and uncertainties,  including but
not limited to, risks  associated with our future growth and operating  results,
our ability to  successfully  integrate the businesses and personnel of acquired
entities into our operations,  changes in consumer preferences and demographics,
technological  and platform  change,  product  returns,  failure of retailers to
sell-through our products,  competitive  factors,  unfavorable  general economic
conditions and other factors  described herein and contained in our Registration
Statement on Form S-3 filed with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission.  Our
actual  operating  results  may vary  significantly  from  such  forward-looking
statements.



                                      -12-


Overview

     Our  principal   sources  of  revenues  are  derived  from  publishing  and
distribution  operations.  Publishing  revenues  are  derived  from  the sale of
internally   developed   software  or  software  licensed  from  third  parties.
Distribution  revenues  are derived  from the sale of  third-party  software and
hardware.  Our  publishing  operations  typically  generate  higher margins than
distribution  operations,  with sales of PC software resulting in higher margins
than sales of cartridges designed for video game consoles.  We recognize revenue
from software sales when titles are shipped. See Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     Our  published  titles are subject to return if not sold to  consumers.  We
establish a reserve for future returns of published  titles at the time of sales
based  primarily on our return  policies and  historical  return  rates,  and we
recognize  revenues net of returns.  We have  historically  experienced a return
rate of  approximately  10% of gross publishing  revenues,  with less than 1% of
distribution  revenues  representing  write-offs for returns.  If future returns
significantly  exceed our  reserves,  our  operating  results would be adversely
affected. See Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Research and development costs consisting primarily of salaries and related
costs incurred prior to establishing  technological  feasibility are expensed in
accordance with Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  Statement No. 86
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer  Software to be Sold,  Leased or Otherwise
Marketed".  In accordance with FASB 86, we capitalize software development costs
subsequent to establishing  technological  feasibility (completion of a detailed
program  design)  which is  amortized  (included  in cost of sales) based on the
greater  of the  proportion  of  current  year  sales to total  estimated  sales
commencing with the title's release or the straight line method.  At October 31,
1999, we had $2,226,670 of capitalized  software  development costs. We evaluate
the recoverability of capitalized software costs which may be reduced materially
in future periods. See Note 2 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Acquisitions

     In February  1999,  we acquired  all of the  outstanding  capital  stock of

paid and $1 million is payable  in May 2000.  Bungie is a leading  developer  of
software games for the PC platform.

     In December 1999, we agreed to purchase 400,000 shares of common stock from
eUniverse,  Inc., a leading online gaming network,  at a purchase price of $5.00
per share. As part of a proposed cooperative  advertising plan, we also have the
option to purchase up to an additional 200,000 shares. Our investment is subject
to eUniverse  qualifying its common stock under the  Securities  Exchange Act of
1934 and  customary  closing  conditions.  In connection  with the  transaction,

Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 1999 and 1998

     Net Sales. Net sales increased by  $111,880,292,  or 57.7%, to $305,931,858
for fiscal 1999 from  $194,051,566  for fiscal 1998.  The increase  reflects the
success of our global publishing and distribution businesses, with approximately
84% of  the  increase  attributable  to  internal  growth.  Publishing  revenues
increased  by  $69,149,500,  or 75.8%,  to  $160,334,972  for  fiscal  1999 from
$91,185,472 for fiscal 1998. Distribution revenues increased by $42,730,792,  or
41.5%, to $145,596,886 for fiscal 1999 from $102,866,094 for fiscal 1998.

     For fiscal 1999,  publishing  and  distribution  activities  accounted  for
approximately  52.4% and 47.6%,  respectively,  of our net sales. For this year,
software products designed for PC and video game console platforms accounted for
approximately 24.8% and 55.8%,  respectively,  of our net sales, with video game

operations  accounted for  approximately  $105,913,316 or 34.6% of our net sales
for fiscal 1999.

     Cost of  Sales.  Cost of sales  increased  by  $67,566,652,  or  45.8%,  to
$215,121,824 for fiscal 1999 from $147,555,172 for fiscal 1998. The increase was
primarily a result of the expanded  scope of our  operations  and was consistent
with revenue  growth.  Cost of sales as a percentage  of net sales  decreased to
70.3% for fiscal 1999 from 76.0% for fiscal 1998.  This  decrease was  primarily
due to  increased  publishing  activities  which  provide  higher  margins  than
distribution activities.

     Selling  and  Marketing.   Selling  and  marketing  expenses  increased  by
$11,422,270,  or 61.1%,  to  $30,108,356  for fiscal 1999 from  $18,686,086  for
fiscal  1998.  Selling  and  marketing  expenses  as a  percentage  of net sales
increased to 9.8% for fiscal 1999 from 9.6% for fiscal 1998.  The increases were
due to increased  marketing and promotion efforts  undertaken to broaden product
distribution  and to assist  retailers in  positioning  our products for sale to
consumers, including television advertising.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative  expenses increased
by $11,528,400 or 84.9%,  to $25,111,531  for fiscal 1999 from  $13,583,131  for
fiscal 1998.  General and  administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales
increased to 8.2% for fiscal 1999 from 7.0% for fiscal 1998.  The increases were
due to additional  salaries,  rent,  insurance premiums and professional fees in
connection with our expanded operations.

     Research and  Development.  Research  and  development  costs  increased by
$3,560,369,  or 209.1%, to $5,262,708 for fiscal 1999 from $1,702,339 for fiscal
1998.  Research and development costs as a percentage of sales increased to 1.7%
for  fiscal  1999  from  0.9% for  fiscal  1998.  This  increase  was  primarily
attributable to the acquisition of DMA Design Limited.



                                      -15-


     Depreciation  and  Amortization.   Depreciation  and  amortization  expense
increased by $987,030,  or 53.8%,  to $2,822,087 for fiscal 1999 from $1,835,057
for fiscal 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of
goodwill associated with acquisitions.  Depreciation and amortization expense as
a percentage of net sales remained constant.

     Interest  Expense.  Interest  expense  decreased by $770,249,  or 20.9%, to
$2,909,826  for fiscal  1999 from  $3,680,075  for  fiscal  1998.  The  decrease
resulted primarily from lower interest rates on bank borrowings.

     Income  Taxes.  Income taxes  increased by  $8,428,106 as a result of a tax
provision  of  $8,093,970  for fiscal  1999,  as  compared  to a tax  benefit of
$334,136 for fiscal 1998.  The increase was due to increased  pre-tax  income in
fiscal 1999 and the full  utilization of prior net operating loss  carryforwards
in fiscal 1998.

     Net  Income.  As a result  of the  foregoing,  we  achieved  net  income of
$16,332,103  for fiscal  1999,  as  compared to a net income of  $7,181,094  for
fiscal 1998.

Fiscal Years Ended October 31, 1998 and 1997

     Net Sales.  Net sales increased by  $96,710,341,  or 99.4%, to $194,051,566
for fiscal 1998 from  $97,341,225  for fiscal 1997.  The increase was  primarily
attributable  to the  acquisition  of  product  rights  from BMG and  Gathering.
Publishing  revenues  increased by  $73,572,671,  or 417.7%,  to $91,185,472 for
fiscal 1998 from  $17,612,801 for fiscal 1997. We also acquired leading software
distributors  to complement  our publishing  activities and to maximize  product
exposure and revenues. Distribution revenues increased by $23,137,670, or 29.0%,
to $102,866,094 for fiscal 1998 from $79,728,424 for fiscal 1997.

     For fiscal 1998,  publishing  and  distribution  activities  accounted  for
approximately 47.0% and 53.0%, respectively,  of our net sales. For fiscal 1998,
software products designed for PC and video game console platforms accounted for
approximately 12.0% and 70.2%,  respectively,  of our net sales, with video game
hardware  accounting  for 11.2% of net  sales.  In  addition,  we  significantly
expanded  our  presence  in  international  markets.   International  operations
accounted for approximately  $41,870,625,  or 21.6%, of our net sales for fiscal
1998.

     Cost of  Sales.  Cost of sales  increased  by  $66,075,764,  or  81.1%,  to
$147,555,172  for fiscal 1998 from $81,479,408 for fiscal 1997. The increase was
primarily a result of the expanded scope of our  operations.  Cost of sales as a
percentage of net sales decreased to 76.0% for fiscal 1998 from 83.7% for fiscal
1997.  This decrease was  primarily due to an increase in publishing  activities
which provide higher margins than distribution operations.

     Selling  and  Marketing.   Selling  and  marketing  expenses  increased  by
$10,643,139,  or 132.3%,  to  $18,686,086  for fiscal 1998 from  $8,042,947  for
fiscal 1997.  Selling and marketing costs as a percentage of net sales increased
to 9.6% for fiscal 1998 from 8.3% for fiscal 1997.  The increases were primarily

distribution  and to assist  retailers in  positioning  our products for sale to
consumers.

by $7,721,170 or 131.7%,  to  $13,583,131  for fiscal 1998 from  $5,861,961  for
fiscal 1997.  General and  administrative  expenses as a percentage of net sales
increased to 7.0% for fiscal 1998 from 6.0% for fiscal 1997.  The increases were
primarily due to increased salaries,  rent,  insurance premiums and professional
fees associated with acquisitions.



                                      -16-


     Research and  Development.  Research  and  development  costs  decreased by
$145,631,  or 7.9%, to  $1,702,339  for fiscal 1998 from  $1,847,970  for fiscal
1997.  Research and development costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 0.9%
for fiscal 1998 from 1.9% for fiscal 1997. This decrease was attributable to the
shift from software development to publishing and distribution.

     Depreciation  and  Amortization.   Depreciation  and  amortization  expense
increased by $830,919,  or 82.8%,  to $1,835,057 for fiscal 1998 from $1,004,138
for fiscal 1997. This increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of
goodwill associated with acquisitions.

     Interest Expense.  Interest expense  increased by $1,836,672,  or 99.6%, to
$3,680,075  for fiscal  1998 from  $1,843,403  for  fiscal  1997.  The  increase
resulted primarily from increased borrowings during fiscal 1998.

     Income Taxes.  Income taxes decreased $363,925 to a tax benefit of $334,136
for fiscal 1998 from a tax  provision of $29,789 for fiscal 1997.  This decrease
was  primarily  attributable  to the  recognition  of a  deferred  tax  asset of
$941,000.

     Net  Income.  As a result  of the  foregoing,  we  achieved  net  income of
$7,181,094  for fiscal 1998, as compared to a net loss of $2,768,391  for fiscal
1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Our primary capital  requirements have been and will continue to be to fund
product commercialization.  We have historically financed our operations through
cash flow from operations,  the issuance of debt and equity  securities and bank
borrowings.  At October 31,  1999,  we had working  capital of  $41,438,968,  as
compared to working capital of $21,797,097 at October 31, 1998.

     Net cash used in operating  activities for fiscal 1999 was $16,745,687,  as
compared to net cash used in operating  activities of $8,021,041 for fiscal 1998
and  $14,460,000  for fiscal 1997.  The increase was primarily  attributable  to
increased  levels of receivables,  inventories  and advances to developers.  Net
cash used in investing  activities for fiscal 1999 was $21,540,778,  as compared
to $727,418 for fiscal 1998 and  $2,583,359  for fiscal  1997.  The increase was
primarily the result of increased cash paid for acquisitions.  Net cash provided
by  financing  activities  for  fiscal  1999  was  $46,778,800  as  compared  to
$9,016,664  for fiscal 1998, and  $18,809,333  for fiscal 1997. The increase was
primarily  the result of increased  borrowings  under the line of credit and the
proceeds from the secondary public offering.

     In December 1999, Take-Two Interactive Software Europe Limited entered into
a line of credit  agreement with Barclays Bank. The line of credit  provides for
borrowings of up to approximately (pound)17,000,000 (approximately $25,000,000).
Advances  under  the line of  credit  bear  interest  at the  rate of 1.4%  over
Barclays' base rate per annum, payable quarterly.  Borrowings are collateralized
by receivables of our European subsidiaries,  and are guaranteed by us. The line
of credit is  repayable  upon demand and is subject to review  prior to November
29, 2000. As of December 31, 1999, $18,561,806 was outstanding under the line of
credit.

     In  December  1999,  we  entered  into a credit  agreement  with a group of
lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as agent, which provides for borrowings of
up to $75,000,000.  We may increase the credit line to up to $85,000,000 subject
to certain conditions. Generally, advances under the line of credit are based on
a borrowing formula equal to the lesser of (1) the borrowing limit or (2) 80% of
eligible accounts receivable,  plus 50% of eligible inventory.  Interest accrues
on such  advances  at the bank's  prime  rate plus 0.5%,  or at LIBOR plus 2.5%.
Borrowings under the line of credit are collaterized by our accounts receivable,
inventory,  equipment,  general  intangibles,   securities  and  other  personal
property, including the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries.  In addition
to certain financial  covenants,  the loan agreement limits or


                                      -17-


prohibits us from declaring or paying cash dividends,  merging or  consolidating
with another  corporation,  selling assets (other than in the ordinary course of
business),  creating liens and incurring  additional  indebtedness.  The line of
credit  expires on December 7, 2002.  As of December 31, 1999,  $61,471,534  was
outstanding under the line of credit.

     In May 1999, we consummated a second  underwritten public offering pursuant
to which we issued 3,005,000  shares of common stock  (including  255,000 shares
sold  pursuant  to  an  overallotment  option)  and  received  net  proceeds  of
$21,852,559.

     Our  accounts  receivable,  less an  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts and
returns,   at  October  31,  1999  were   $108,802,903.   Of  such  receivables,
approximately  $15,678,705 or 14.4% were due from Ames  Department  Stores.  The
Company's receivables are covered by insurance and generally have been collected
in the ordinary course of business. Our sales are typically made on credit, with
terms that vary  depending  upon the customer and the demand for the  particular
title  being  sold.  We do not hold any  collateral  to  secure  payment  by our
customers.  As a result,  we are subject to credit  risks,  particularly  in the
event  that any of our  receivables  represent  sales  to a  limited  number  of
retailers or are  concentrated in foreign  markets.  If we are unable to collect
our accounts  receivable as they become due and such accounts are not covered by
insurance, our liquidity and working capital position could suffer.

     We have no material commitments for capital expenditures.

Fluctuations in Operating Results; Seasonality

     We  have  experienced  and  may  continue  to  experience  fluctuations  in
quarterly  operating  results as a result of timing in the  introduction  of new
titles; variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms; market
acceptance of our titles;  development and promotional  expenses relating to the
introduction  of  new  titles,  sequels  or  enhancements  of  existing  titles;
projected  and actual  changes  in  platforms;  the timing and  success of title
introductions by our competitors;  product returns;  changes in pricing policies
by us and our  competitors;  the  accuracy of  retailers'  forecasts of consumer
demand;  the size and timing of  acquisitions;  the timing of orders  from major
customers; and order cancellations and delays in shipment.

     Sales of our titles are seasonal,  with peak shipments  typically occurring
in the fourth  calendar  quarter  (our fourth and first  fiscal  quarters)  as a
result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season.

International Operations

     Sales in international  markets,  primarily in the United Kingdom and other
countries in Europe,  have accounted for an increasing  portion of our revenues.
For the years ended  October 31,  1999,  1998 and 1997,  sales in  international
markets accounted for approximately 34.6%, 21.6% and 5.9%, respectively,  of our
revenues. We are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade, including increased
credit risks,  tariffs and duties,  fluctuations  in foreign  currency  exchange
rates,  shipping  delays and  international  political,  regulatory and economic
developments,  all of  which  can have a  significant  impact  on our  operating
results. Sales in the various countries are made in their local currencies.

Year 2000

     The inability of computers to recognize and properly process Year 2000 data
may cause software  applications to fail or reach erroneous results.  We believe
that our  accounting  and  management  software  and PC  products  are Year 2000
compliant.  To our knowledge,  neither we nor any of our principal  customers or
suppliers has experienced any difficulties relating to the Year 2000.

                        Report of Independent Accountants



To the Stockholders of
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. and Subsidiaries:



In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets and the related
consolidated  statements  of  operations,  stockholders'  equity and cash flows,
present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Take-Two
Interactive Software,  Inc. and Subsidiaries at October 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period  ended  October 31,  1999,  in  conformity  with  principles
generally  accepted in the United  States.  These  financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial  statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
December  31, 1997  financial  statements  of Jack of All Games,  Inc., a wholly
owned  subsidiary,  which  statements  reflect total  revenues  constituting  77
percent,  net income  constituting 46 percent,  and total assets constituting 54
percent of the related  consolidated  totals.  Those  statements were audited by
other auditors  whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion,  insofar
as it relates to the  amounts  included  for Jack of All Games,  Inc.,  is based
solely on the reports of the other  auditors.  We conducted  our audits of these
statements  in  accordance  with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the
United  States,  which  require  that we plan and  perform  the  audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by management and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Jack of All Games, Inc.
(An S Corporation)
Cincinnati, Ohio

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Jack of All Games, Inc. (An S
Corporation)  as of December 31,  1997,  and the related  statements  of income,
retained  earnings,  and cash  flows for the year then  ended.  These  financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred to in the first  paragraph
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of Jack of All
Games,  Inc. (an S  Corporation)  as of December 31, 1997 and the results of its
operations  and its cash  flows  for the year  then  ended  in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.

1.   Description of the Business:

     Take-Two  Interactive  Software,  Inc.  ("Take-Two"  or the  "Company") was
     incorporated  in the State of Delaware on September 30, 1993.  Take-Two and
     its wholly owned subsidiaries develop,  publish, and distribute interactive
     software games designed for  multimedia  personal  computers and video game
     console platforms.

2.   Significant Accounting Policies:

     Basis of Presentation

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the financial statements of
     Take-Two and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany  balances and
     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

     As discussed in Note 3, in 1999 and 1998,  the Company  acquired all of the
     outstanding  stock of Talonsoft  ("Talonsoft")  and Jack of All Games, Inc.
     ("JAG"),  respectively.  In 1997, the Company acquired Inventory Management
     Systems,   Inc.  ("IMSI")  and  Creative  Alliance  Group  ("CAG").   These
     acquisitions have been accounted for as poolings of interests in accordance
     with APB No. 16 and accordingly, the accompanying financial statements have
     been restated to include the results of operations  and financial  position
     for all periods presented.

     Risks and Uncertainties

     Substantially all of the Company's net sales are attributable to publishing
     and distribution  revenues.  The publishing and distribution aspects of the
     Company's   business   are  subject  to   increasing   competition,   rapid
     technological  change and evolving  consumer  preferences,  which result in
     shorter product  lifecycles.  The Company's  continued success depends upon
     its ability to acquire,  develop and market software products,  which often
     requires substantial  financing.  Additionally,  the financing for software
     products  acquired or licensed must be on terms  acceptable to the Company.
     If sales  from newly  acquired  and  developed  software  products  fail to
     materialize,  the  Company's  business,  operating  results  and  financial
     condition could be adversely affected in the near term.

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
     the  disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the dates of the
     financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
     during  the  reporting   periods.   The  most  significant   estimates  and
     assumptions  relate  to  prepaid  royalties,  advances  to  developer,  the
     recoverability   of   capitalized   software   development   costs,   other
     intangibles,  income taxes, allowances for returns and receivables.  Actual
     amounts could differ from those estimates.

     Concentration of Credit Risk

     A significant  portion of cash balances are  maintained  with several major
     financial  institutions  with satisfactory  standing and at times,  exceeds
     insurable amounts.

     If the financial condition and operations of the Company's  distributors or
     retailers deteriorate, the risk of collection could increase substantially.
     As of October 31, 1999 and 1998, the  receivable  balances from the largest
     customer  amounted to  approximately  14.4% and 14.9% of the  Company's net
     balance,  respectively.  The 1999 receivable  balance is partially  insured
     whereas the 1998 receivable balance was fully insured.  For the years ended
     October  1999,  1998 and 1997,  the  Company's  five (5) largest  customers
     accounted for 24.5%, 22.4% and 36.2% of net sales, respectively. Except for
     largest  customer noted above,  all receivable  balances from the remaining
     customers were less than 10%.



                                      F-7


     Revenue Recognition

     Distribution  revenue is derived from the sale of  third-party  interactive
     software games and hardware and is recognized  upon the shipment of product
     to retailers.  Distribution revenue amounted to $145,596,886,  $102,866,094
     and  $79,728,424  for  1999,  1998  and  1997,  respectively.  The  Company
     sometimes   negotiates   accommodations   to  retailers,   including  price
     discounts,  credits and product returns,  when demand for specific products
     fall  below  expectations.  Historically,  the  Company's  write-offs  from
     returns  for  its  distribution  activities  have  been  less  than  1%  of
     distribution  revenues.  Publishing  revenue  is  derived  from the sale of
     internally developed interactive software games or from the sale of product
     licensed from a third party  developer and is recognized  upon the shipment
     of product to  retailers.  Publishing  revenue  amounted  to  $160,334,972,
     $91,185,472  and  $17,612,801  in 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  The
     Company has historically experienced a product return rate of approximately
     10% of gross publishing revenues.

     The Company's  distribution  arrangements  with retailers  generally do not
     give them the right to return  products,  however,  the  Company  generally
     accepts  product  returns for stock  balancing or defective  products.  The
     Company's  publishing  arrangements  require the Company to accept  product
     returns.  The Company  establishes a reserve for future returns at the time
     of product  sales,  based  primarily  on these  return  policies,  markdown
     allowances,   and  historical  return  rates,  and  as  such,  the  Company
     recognizes revenues net of product returns.

     Advertising

     The Company reports the costs of all advertising as expenses in the periods
     in which those costs are incurred.  Advertising costs in which the benefits
     exist in the future  period are  recorded  as prepaid  assets.  The Company
     shares portions of certain  customers'  advertising  expenses through co-op
     advertising  arrangements.  Advertising expense for the years ended October
     31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 amounted to $11,986,347, $6,670,303 and $1,038,407,
     respectively.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original
     maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

     Inventory

     Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.  The Company
     periodically  evaluates the carrying value of its  inventories  and adjusts
     these as necessary.

     Prepaid Royalties

     Prepaid  royalties  represent  prepayments  made  to  independent  software
     developers under development agreements.  Prepaid royalties are expensed at
     the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of sales based on actual net product
     sales.  Management continuously evaluates the future realization of prepaid
     royalties,  and charges to cost of sales any amount that  management  deems
     unlikely to be realized based upon the contractual royalty rate and product
     sales.  Prepaid royalties are classified as current and non-current  assets
     based upon  estimated  net  product  sales  within  the next year.  Prepaid
     royalties were written down $1,307,717, $884,454 and $350,000 for the years
     ended  October 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively,  to  estimated  net
     realizable   value.   Amortization   of  prepaid   royalties   amounted  to
     $12,144,006,  $9,093,885,  and $3,644,935 during fiscal years 1999,1998 and
     1997, respectively.

     Fixed Assets

     Computer   equipment,   office   equipment,   furniture  and  fixtures  and
     automobiles  are  depreciated  using the  straight-line  method  over their
     estimated  lives  ranging  from five to seven years.  Computer  software is
     depreciated  using the  straight-line  method over three  years.  Leasehold
     improvements are amortized over the


                                      F-8


     lesser  of the  term  of the  related  lease  or  estimated  useful  lives.
     Accumulated amortization includes the amortization of assets recorded under
     capital  leases.  The  carrying  value  of these  assets  are  recorded  at
     historical cost. The cost of additions and betterments  greater than $1,000
     is capitalized.

     Capitalized Software Development Costs

     Costs  associated  with research and  development are expensed as incurred.
     Software    development   costs   incurred   subsequent   to   establishing
     technological  feasibility are capitalized.  Capitalized software costs are
     compared,  by game title, to estimated net realizable  value of the product
     and  capitalized  amounts in excess of estimated net realizable  value,  if
     any, are immediately written off.  Capitalized  software costs were written
     down by $698,407,  $1,411,784  and $210,500 for the years ended October 31,
     1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively,  to estimated  net  realizable  value.
     Amortization   of  capitalized   software  costs  amounted  to  $1,135,505,
     $1,767,486 and $755,986 during 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     Net Income (Loss) per Share

     Net  income  (loss)  per share has been  computed  in  accordance  with the
     Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial
     Accounting  Standards  No. 128,  Earnings  per Share ("SFAS No. 128") which
     requires  the  presentation  of basic  earnings  per share  ("EPS"),  which
     excludes  common stock  equivalents  from its  computation and requires the
     presentation  of diluted EPS which gives effect to all  dilutive  potential
     common  shares that were  outstanding  during the period.  The  computation
     excludes  the  number  of  common  shares  issuable  upon the  exercise  of
     outstanding  options and warrants and the conversion of preferred  stock if
     such inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

     Comprehensive Income (Loss)

     The Company has adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.
     130, Reporting Comprehensive Income ("SFAS No. 130").  Comprehensive income
     (loss) represents the change in net assets of a business  enterprise during
     a  period  from  transactions  and  other  events  and  circumstances  from
     non-owner sources.  Comprehensive income (loss) of the Company includes net
     income  (loss)  adjusted  for the  change in foreign  currency  translation
     adjustments.  The net effect of income taxes on comprehensive income (loss)
     is immaterial. The disclosures required by SFAS No. 130 for the years ended
     October 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997 have been  included in the  Statements  of
     Stockholders' Equity.

     Intangible Assets

     Intangible  assets consist of trademarks and the remaining  excess purchase
     price paid over  identified  intangible and tangible net assets of acquired
     companies.  Intangible assets are amortized under the straight-line  method
     over the period of expected  benefit of seven years for the  acquisition of
     development  studios  and ten years  for the  acquisition  of  distribution
     operations.  The Company  assesses  the  recoverability  of its  intangible
     assets by determining  whether the carrying value can be recovered  through
     estimated  future cash flows over its remaining  life. If estimated  future
     cash flows indicate that the unamortized balance will not be recovered,  an
     adjustment  will  be  made  to  reduce  the  carrying  value  to an  amount
     consistent  with  estimated  future cash flows  discounted at the Company's
     incremental  borrowing  rate.  Cash flow  estimates  are based on trends of
     historical  performance and  management's  estimate of future  performance,
     giving  consideration to existing and anticipated  competitive and economic
     conditions.

     Income Taxes

     The Company recognizes  deferred taxes under the asset and liability method
     of  accounting  for income  taxes.  Under the asset and  liability  method,
     deferred income taxes are recognized for differences  between the financial
     statement  and tax bases of assets and  liabilities  at  currently  enacted
     statutory tax rates for the years in which the  differences are expected to
     reverse.  The  effect  on  deferred  taxes  of a  change  in tax  rates  is

                                      F-9


     recognized  in income in the period that  includes the  enactment  date. In
     addition,  valuation  allowances are  established  when necessary to reduce
     deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

     Foreign Currency Translation

     The  functional  currency  for  the  Company's  foreign  operations  is the
     applicable  local currency.  Accounts of foreign  operations are translated
     into U.S.  dollars using quarter or year-end  exchange rates for assets and
     liabilities at the balance sheet date and average prevailing exchange rates
     for the period for revenue and expense accounts. Adjustments resulting from
     translation are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

     Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, including cash
     and cash equivalents,  accounts receivable,  prepaid royalties, advances to
     developers,  accounts  payable and accrued  liabilities,  approximate  fair
     value  because  of their  short  maturities.  The  carrying  amount  of the
     Company's  line of credit,  notes  payable  and  capital  lease  obligation
     approximates  the fair value of such  instruments  based upon  management's
     best estimate of interest  rates that would be available to the Company for
     similar debt obligations at October 31, 1999.

3.   Business Acquisitions:

     The Company  acquired a number of  companies  that  develop,  publish,  and
     distribute  interactive  software games during the three-year  period ended
     October 31, 1999. The aggregate  purchase  price,  including cash and stock
     payments,  was $9.7 million,  $13.2 million and $3.8 million in 1999,  1998
     and 1997, respectively.  The aggregate purchase price excludes the value of
     stock issued for pooled companies.

     In 1999,  1998 and 1997,  1,033,336,  2,750,000  and 900,000  shares of the
     Company's  common  stock were  issued  for  acquisitions  accounted  for as
     poolings of interests.  The companies  pooled and the respective  shares of
     the Company's common stock issued were:  Talonsoft  1,033,336  shares,  JAG
     2,750,000 shares and IMSI and CAG 900,000 shares.

     The  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements,  including the related
     notes,  have been restated as of the earliest  period  presented to include
     the results of operations,  financial  position and cash flows of the above
     pooled  entities.  The  Company,  as well  as IMSI  and  CAG,  reports  its
     financial  results on an October 31 fiscal year-end basis,  whereas JAG and
     Talonsoft  reported  their  financial  results  on a December  31  calendar
     year-end  basis.  For the purpose of pooling of interests  accounting,  the
     Company's  statement of operations  for the year ended October 31, 1997 was
     combined with JAG's and  Talonsoft's  statement of operations  for the year
     ended December 31, 1997. The Company's statement of operations for the year
     ended  October  31,  1998  includes  JAG's  and  Talonsoft's  statement  of
     operations   for  the  period   November  1,  1997  to  October  31,  1998.
     Accordingly,  JAG's and  Talonsoft's  net income of $431,527 and  $149,562,
     respectively, for the two months ended December 31, 1997 has been reflected
     as an adjustment to retained  earnings for the year ended October 31, 1998.
     The results of  operations  of JAG and Talonsoft for such two months period
     includes net revenues of  $23,893,108  and  $351,609,  respectively.  A net
     sales and net income (loss) reconciliation for the years ending October 31,
     1998 and 1997 is summarized below:

     The "As Reported" balances shown above reflect amounts previously  reported
     on Form 10-K for 1998 and Form 10-KSB for 1997, net of  distributions  paid
     to S  corporation  shareholders  prior to  acquisition  . The "As Restated"
     balance for 1998 reflects the restatement for Talonsoft  pooled in December
     1998. The "As Restated"  balance for 1997 reflects the  restatement for JAG
     pooled in August 1998 and Talonsoft.

     The  acquisitions  described  below  have been  accounted  for as  purchase
     transactions in accordance with APB No. 16 and, accordingly, the results of
     operations and financial  position of the acquired  businesses are included
     in the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  from  the  date  of
     acquisition.

     In 1999,  the Company paid $1.2 million in cash,  issued  637,547 shares of
     its common stock (valued at $6.1 million),  and incurred direct transaction
     costs  of  approximately   $390,000  for  acquisitions   accounted  for  as
     purchases.  These  acquisitions  include LDA Distribution  Limited ("LDA"),
     Joytech  Europe  Limited  ("Joytech"),  DVDWave.com,  Funsoft  Nordic  A.S.

     Verte,  S.p.A.  ("CD Verte").  In addition,  for CD Verte, the Company paid
     $800,000  on  December  1, 1999 and will pay an  additional  $1.2  million,
     subject to downward  adjustment based on net income of the acquired entity,
     over a three-year  period.  The most significant  assumption of liabilities
     relate to the acquisition of DMA where the Company  assumed  liabilities of
     $12.3 million.

     In 1998,  the Company paid $1.5 million in cash,  issued  540,000 shares of
     its common stock (valued at $1.9 million),  issued  1,850,000 shares of its
     Series A Convertible  Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock" valued at $9.5
     million) and granted 76,000 non-plan stock options (valued at $250,000) for
     acquisitions accounted for as purchases.  The Preferred Stock was converted
     into Common Stock in August 1998 on a one-for-one basis. These acquisitions
     include Alliance Inventory  Management ("AIM"),  DirectSoft  Australia Pty.
     Ltd.  ("DirectSoft") and substantially all of the assets of BMG Interactive
     Group.

     In 1997,  the Company  issued 406,553 shares of its common stock (valued at
     $3 million)  and  recorded a liability  for  acquisition  related  deferred
     payments of $700,000 for  acquisitions  accounted for as  purchases.  These
     acquisitions  include Take-Two  Interactive Software Europe Limited ("TTE")
     and Alternative Reality Technologies ("ART").

4.   Investment:

     In February 1999, the Company purchased a 19.9% Class A limited partnership
     interest in Gathering of Developers I, Ltd.  ("Gathering")  for $4 million.
     Gathering is a developer-driven computer and video game publishing company.
     In accordance with APB No. 18, the investment has been accounted for by the
     equity  method  due  to  the  Company  having  significant  influence  over
     Gathering.  The difference between the carrying value of the investment and
     the underlying  equity in the net assets amounted to $4,376,529,  which was
     recorded as an intangible  asset.  This intangible asset is being amortized
     under the straight-line method over the period of expected benefit of seven
     years.

     In  addition,  the  general  partner  and each  Class B limited  partner of
     Gathering granted the Company an option to purchase all of their interests,
     exercisable on two separate  occasions during the six-month  periods ending
     April 30, 2001 and 2002 based on a fixed formula.  In  consideration of the
     option grant,  the Company issued  Gathering's  partners  125,000 shares of
     common stock, valued at $1,275,000,  which is being amortized over the life
     of the purchase option.

     In February 1997, the holder of Class B Preferred  Stock elected to convert

     As of October  31,  1999 and 1998,  there are  outstanding  non-plan  stock
     options for an aggregate of 1,060,167  and 166,320  shares of Common Stock,
     respectively, at prices ranging from $2.00 to $12.56 per share vesting from
     1999 to 2002 and expiring at various times from 2002 to 2004.

     For  those  options  with  exercise  prices  less  than  fair  value at the
     measurement  date,  the  difference is amortized  over the vesting  period.
     Compensation  expense for the years ended October 31, 1999,  1998, and 1997
     approximated $29,000, $121,000, and $17,000, respectively.

     The  following  table  summarizes  the activity in options  under the plans
     inclusive of non-plan options:

     The following  summarizes  information  about stock options  outstanding at
     October 31, 1999 and 1998:




     The Company applies APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
     and related  interpretations  in accounting for its plans.  The Company has
     adopted the  disclosure-only  provision  of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for
     Stock-Based  Compensation"  ("SFAS No. 123"). Had compensation cost for the
     Company's stock option plan been determined  based on the fair value at the
     grant date for awards in 1999, 1998 and 1997 consistent with the provisions
     of SFAS No. 123, the  Company's net income (loss) and the net income (loss)
     per share would have been reduced to the pro-forma amounts indicated below.




     The pro-forma  disclosures  shown are not  representative of the effects on
     net income (loss) and the net income (loss) per share in future years.

     The fair value of the Company's stock options used to compute pro-forma net
     income  (loss)  and the net  income  (loss)  per share  disclosures  is the
     estimated   present  value  at  the  grant  date  using  the  Black-Scholes
     option-pricing  model. The following weighted average  assumptions for 1999
     were used to value  grants:  expected  volatility  of 60% for grants with a
     holding  period of three to four years and 65% for holding  periods of five
     years or more;  a risk-free  interest  rate of  generally  4% to 6%; and an
     expected  holding  period  of three  to five  years.  For  1998  and  1997,
     respectively, the following weighted average assumptions were used to value
     grants; expected volatility of 55% and 60%; a risk-free interest rate of 5%
     and 6.22%;  and an expected  holding period of four to five years and seven
     years, respectively.

14.  Results By Quarter (Unaudited):





     The "As  Reported"  balances  reflect  amounts  previously  reported  which
     incorporated  the results of all prior acquired  companies.  The "Restated"
     balances  reflect the restatement  for companies  pooled in August 1998 and
     December 1998.

15.  Geographic Areas:

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures about Segments of
     an Enterprise and Related  Information" ("SFAS No. 131"), which established
     standards  for reporting  information  about  operating  segments in annual
     financial statements. It also establishes standards for related disclosures
     about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. SFAS No.
     131  had no  impact  on the  Company's  results  of  operations,  financial
     position or cash flows.

     For the years ended  October 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997,  the  Company's  net
     sales in domestic  markets  accounted for  approximately  65.4%,  78.4% and
     94.1%,  respectively,  and net sales in international markets accounted for
     34.6%, 21.6% and 5.9%, respectively.

     As of October 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company's net fixed assets in domestic
     markets   accounted   for   approximately    $1,762,749   and   $1,287,151,
     respectively,  and net fixed assets in international  markets accounted for
     $2,357,568 and $692,507, respectively.

     Net Sales are  attributed to  geographic  areas based on where the products
     were shipped to.


16.  Net Income (Loss) per Share:

     The  computation  for diluted number of shares  excludes those  unexercised
     stock  options  and  warrants  which are  antidilutive.  The number of such
     shares were  470,000,  50,000 and 4,192,298 for the years ended October 31,
     1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     The following table provides a  reconciliation  of basic earnings per share
     to dilutive  earnings per share for the years ended October 31, 1999,  1998
     and 1997. The  extraordinary  gain for the year ended October 31, 1998, has
     no significant  effect on the EPS calculation  and therefore,  is not shown
     separately.

17.  Subsequent Events:

     In November 1999, the Company  acquired  19.9% of the  outstanding  capital
     stock of Bungie Software Products  Corporation for $5 million,  of which $4
     million  was paid,  and $1  million  is  payable  in May 2000.  Bungie is a
     leading developer of software games for the PC platform.

     In December 1999, Take-Two Interactive Software Europe Limited entered into
     a line of credit agreement with Barclays' Bank. The line of credit provides
     for  borrowings of up to  approximately  British  Pounds  (pound)17,000,000
     (approximately  $25,000,000).  Advances  under  the  line  of  credit  bear
     interest at the rate of 1.4% over  Barclays'  base rate per annum,  payable
     quarterly.  Borrowings are  collateralized  by receivables of the Company's
     European  subsidiaries,  and are  guaranteed  by the  Company.  The line of
     credit is repayable  upon demand and is subject to review prior to November
     29, 2000. This replaces the Barclay's line of credit described in Note 7.

     In December 1999, the Company entered into a credit  agreement with a group
     of lenders led by Bank of  America,  N.A.,  as agent,  which  provides  for
     borrowings of up to  $75,000,000.  The Company may increase the credit line
     to up to $85,000,000  subject to certain  conditions.  Interest  accrues on
     such  advances  at the bank's  prime rate plus 0.5% or at LIBOR plus 2.5 %.
     Borrowings  under  the  line  of  credit  are  collaterized  by  all of the
     Company's accounts receivable,  inventory,  equipment, general intangibles,
     securities and other personal property,  including the capital stock of the
     Company's domestic subsidiaries.  The line of credit expires on December 7,
     2002. This replaces the NationsBank line of credit described in Note 7.

     In  December  1999,  the Company  agreed to  purchase up to 600,000  shares
     (approximately  less than 5%) of common  stock  from  eUniverse,  Inc.  The
     Company's  investment is subject to eUniverse  qualifying  its common stock
     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and customary closing conditions.
     In connection with the transaction, eUniverse agreed to purchase all of the
     capital stock of DVDWave.com,  which includes the DVDWave.com website, from
     the Company for 310,00 shares of common stock.
