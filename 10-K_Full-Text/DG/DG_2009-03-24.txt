General

This
report contains references to years 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, which
represent fiscal years ending or ended January 29, 2010, January 30, 2009,
February 1, 2008, February 2, 2007, February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005,
respectively.  All of the discussion and analysis in this report should be
read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related notes.

Forward Looking
Statements

“Forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws are included
throughout this report, particularly under the headings “Business” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” among others. You can identify these statements because they are
not solely statements of historical fact or they use words such as “may,”
“will,” “should,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” “expect,”
“estimate,” “objective,” “forecast,” “goal,” “intend,” “will likely result,” or
“will continue” and similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans or
intentions. For example, all statements relating to our estimated and projected
earnings, costs, expenditures, cash flows and financial results, our plans and
objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives, or the expected outcome
or impact of pending or threatened litigation are forward-looking statements.

All
forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
change at any time, so our actual results may differ materially from those that
we expected. We derive many of these statements from our operating budgets and
forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions that we believe are
reasonable. However, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known
factors, and we cannot anticipate all factors that could affect our actual
results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements are disclosed
under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this document
(including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking
statements themselves and under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates”). All written and oral forward-looking statements we make in the
future are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements
as well as other cautionary statements that we make from time to time in our
other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all of our
forward-looking statements in the context of these risks and uncertainties.

The
forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date
hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.


PART I

ITEM
1.

BUSINESS

General

We
are the largest discount retailer in the United States by number of stores, with
8,414 stores located in 35 states, primarily in the southern, southwestern,
midwestern and eastern United States, as of February 27, 2009.  We serve a
broad customer base and offer a focused assortment of everyday items, including
basic consumable merchandise and other home, apparel and seasonal products.
 A majority of our products are priced at $10 or less and approximately 25%
of our products are priced at $1 or less.

We
offer a compelling value proposition for our customers based on convenient store
locations, easy in and out shopping and quality name brand and private brand
merchandise at highly competitive everyday low prices. We believe our
combination of value and convenience distinguishes us from other discount,
convenience and drugstore retailers, who typically focus on either value or
convenience. Our business model is focused on strong and sustainable sales
growth, attractive margins, and limited maintenance capital expenditure and
working capital needs, which, in combination, result in significant cash flow
from operations (before interest).

We
were founded in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale.  We opened our
first dollar store in 1955, when we were incorporated as a Kentucky corporation
under the name J.L. Turner & Son, Inc.  We changed our name to Dollar
General Corporation in 1968 and reincorporated as a Tennessee corporation in
1998.  In 2007, we entered into a merger transaction with an entity
controlled by investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., L.P. (“KKR” or “Sponsor”), as discussed in more detail under “Our 2007
Merger” below.

We
have increased our total number of stores from 6,700 on January 30, 2004, to
8,362 on January 30, 2009, a 4.5% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”).
 Over the same period, we grew our net sales from $6.9 billion to $10.5
billion (8.8% CAGR), driven by growth in number of stores as well as same store
sales growth. We slowed new store growth in 2007 and 2008 and closed
approximately 400 stores in 2007 to improve our profitability and to enable us
to focus on improving the performance of existing stores. In 2008, we opened 207
new stores, closed 39 stores, and relocated or remodeled 404 existing stores.
Net sales in 2008 were driven primarily by a same-store sales increase of 9.0%.
See our Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales and net income (loss)
for each of our last three fiscal years and total assets for each of our last
two fiscal years. We intend to accelerate our new store growth in 2009 with
plans to open approximately 450 new stores and to remodel or relocate
approximately 400 stores.

Our 2007
Merger

On
July 6, 2007, we completed a merger (the “Merger”), and, as a result,  we
are a subsidiary of Buck Holdings, L.P. (“Parent”), a Delaware limited
partnership controlled by investment funds affiliated with KKR. KKR, GS Capital
Partners VI Fund, L.P. and affiliated funds (affiliates of Goldman,
Sachs & Co.), Citi Private Equity, Wellington Management


Company,
LLP, CPP Investment Board (USRE II) Inc., and other equity co-investors
(collectively, the “Investors”) indirectly own a substantial portion of our
capital stock through their investment in Parent.

As
a result of the Merger, our outstanding common stock is now owned by Parent and
certain members of management. Our common stock is not registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is not traded on a national
securities exchange.

We
entered into the following debt financings in conjunction with the Merger:

·

We
entered into a credit agreement and related security and other agreements
consisting of a $2.3 billion senior secured term loan facility, which
matures on July 6, 2014 (the “Term Loan Facility”).

·

We
entered into a credit agreement and related security and other agreements
consisting of a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to
$1.125 billion (of which $432.3 million was drawn at closing and
$132.3 million was paid down on the same day), subject to borrowing base
availability, which matures July 6, 2013 (the “ABL Facility” and, with the
Term Loan Facility, the “Credit Facilities”).

·

We
issued $1.175 billion aggregate principal amount of 10.625% senior notes
due 2015, which mature on July 15, 2015, and $725 million aggregate
principal amount of 11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017,
which mature on July 15, 2017. We repurchased $25.0 million and $44.1
million of the senior subordinated toggle notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2007 and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, respectively.

Accounting
periods before and after the Merger are referred to as the Predecessor and
Successor, respectively.

Overall Business
Strategy

Our
mission is “Serving Others.” To carry out this mission, we have developed a
business strategy of providing our customers with a focused assortment of
everyday low priced merchandise in a convenient, small-store format.

Our
Customers

.  In general, we locate our stores and base our merchandise
selection on the needs of households seeking value and convenience, with an
emphasis on rural and small markets. However, much of

our merchandise,
intended to serve the basic consumable, household, apparel and seasonal needs of
these targeted customers, also appeals to a much broader and higher income
customer base.

Our
Stores

. The traditional Dollar General® store has, on average, approximately
7,000 square feet of selling space and generally serves customers who live
within three miles of the store.  Of our 8,414 stores operating as of
February 27, 2009, more than 60% serve communities


with
populations of 20,000 or less.  We believe that our target customers prefer
the convenience of a small, neighborhood store with a focused merchandise
assortment at value prices.

Our
Merchandise

.  Our merchandising strategy combines a low-cost operating
structure with a focused assortment of products, consisting of quality basic
consumable, household, apparel and seasonal merchandise at competitive everyday
low prices. Our strategic combination of name brands, quality private brand
products and other great value brands allows us to offer our customers a
compelling value proposition. We believe our merchandising strategy and focused
assortment generate frequent repeat customer purchases and encourage customers
to shop at our stores for their everyday household needs.

Our
Prices.

We distribute quality, consumable merchandise at everyday low
prices.  Our strategy of maintaining a low-cost operating structure and a
focused assortment of merchandise allows us to offer quality merchandise at
competitive prices.  As part of this strategy, we emphasize even-dollar
prices on many of our items.  In the typical Dollar General store, the
majority of the products are priced at $10 or less, with approximately 25% of
the products priced at $1 or less.

Our
Cost Controls

. We aggressively manage our overhead cost structure and
generally seek to locate stores in neighborhoods where rental and operating
costs are relatively low.  Our stores typically have low fixed costs,
including lean staffing. In recent years, we implemented “EZstore

TM

”,
our proprietary process designed to improve inventory flow from our distribution
centers, or DCs, to consumers. The EZstore process has allowed us to reallocate
store labor hours to more customer-focused activities, improving the work
content in our stores.

We
also attempt to control operating costs by implementing new technology when
feasible. In recent years we have improved our store labor scheduling,
 store replenishment, and our supply chain and warehousing systems. We are
in the process of expanding our technological capabilities by installing store
computers throughout the chain. This initiative is expected to improve store
communications and execution and reduce costs.

Strategic
Initiatives

—

Project Alpha.

In 2007, we executed strategic
initiatives launched in the fourth quarter of 2006 aimed at improving our
merchandising and real estate strategies, which we refer to collectively as
“Project Alpha.” Project Alpha was based upon a comprehensive analysis of the
performance of each of our stores and the impact of our inventory management
model on our ability to effectively serve our customers.

The
execution of this merchandising initiative has moved us away from our
traditional inventory packaway model, where unsold seasonal, apparel and home
products inventory items were stored on-site and returned to the sales floor
until the items were eventually sold, damaged or discarded.  In connection
with this initiative, in fiscal 2007 we began taking end-of-season markdowns on
current-year non-replenishable merchandise. With limited and planned exceptions,
we eliminated, through end-of-season and other markdowns, our seasonal, home
products and basic clothing packaway merchandise and out of season current year
merchandise by the end of fiscal 2007. In addition to allowing us to carry
newer, fresher merchandise, particularly in our seasonal, apparel and home
categories, we believe this strategy change has


enhanced
the appearance of our stores and has positively impacted customer satisfaction
as well as our store employees’ ability to manage stores.

Project
Alpha also encompassed significant improvements to our real estate practices. We
have integrated the functions of site selection, lease renewals, relocations,
remodels and store closings and have defined and are implementing rigorous
analytical processes for decision-making in those areas. As a first step in our
initiative to revitalize our store base, we performed a comprehensive real
estate review resulting in the identification of approximately 400
underperforming stores, all of which we closed by mid-2007. These closings were
in addition to stores that are typically closed in the normal course of
business, which over the last 10 years constituted approximately 1% to 2% of our
store base per year. In 2008, our store closings were more in line with historic
levels, as we closed 39 stores.  As part of Project Alpha, we moderated our
new store growth rate beginning in 2007 to enable us to focus on improving the
performance of existing stores, including increasing the number of store
remodels and relocations in order to improve productivity and enhance the
shopping experience for our customers. We intend to accelerate our new store
growth in 2009 by opening approximately 450 new stores and remodeling or
relocating approximately 400 stores.

As
a result of opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, as of February
27, 2009, approximately 1,600 stores are operating in our racetrack format,
which is designed with improved merchandise adjacencies and wider, more open
aisles to enhance the overall guest shopping experience. We plan to continue to
review and refine all of our existing store layouts, including the racetrack
format, as well as test new layouts to further drive sales growth and margin
enhancements through improved merchandising.

Our
Industry

We
compete in the deep discount segment of the U.S. retail industry. Our
competitors include traditional “dollar stores,” as well as other retailers
offering discounted convenience items. The “dollar store” sector differentiates
itself from other forms of retailing in the deep discount segment by offering
consistently low prices in a convenient, small-store format. Unlike other
formats that have suffered with the rise of Wal-Mart and other discount
supercenters, the “dollar store” sector has grown despite the presence of the
discount supercenters.  We believe it is our substantial convenience
advantage, at prices comparable to those of supercenters, that allows Dollar
General to compete so effectively.

We
believe that there is considerable room for growth in the “dollar store” sector.
According to data from Nielsen Homescan Panel (“Nielsen”), “dollar stores” have
been able to increase their penetration across all income brackets in recent
years, climbing from 45% in 1997 to 64% in 2008. Though traditional “dollar
stores” have high customer penetration, according to Nielsen the sector as a
whole accounts for only approximately 1.5% of retail spending, which we believe
leaves ample room for growth. Our merchandising initiatives are aimed at
increasing our stores’ share of customer spending.

See
“Our Competitive Strengths” and “Competition” below for additional information
regarding our competitive situation.


Our
Competitive Strengths

Market
Leader in an Attractive Sector with a Growing Customer Base.

We are
the largest discount retailer in the U.S. by number of stores, with 8,414 stores
in 35 states as of February 27, 2009.  We are the largest player in the
U.S. small box deep discount segment based on sales.  We believe we are
well positioned to further increase our market share as we continue to execute
our business strategy and implement our operational initiatives.  Our
target customers are those seeking value and convenience. According to Nielsen,
recent trip consolidation has caused decreased total outlet trips per shopper by
approximately 2.5%.  At the same time the “dollar store” channel grew trips
per shopper by approximately 2.5%, faster than any other retail channel and the
only channel other than warehouse clubs that increased trips per shopper.

Consistent
Sales Growth and Strong Cash Flow Generation.

For 19 consecutive years, we
have experienced positive annual same store sales growth.  Approximately
two-thirds of our net sales come from the sale of consumable products, which are
less susceptible to economic pressures (such as increased fuel costs and
unemployment), with the remaining one-third comprised mainly of seasonal, basic
clothing and home products which are subject to little trend or fashion risk.
 We have a low cost operating model with attractive operating margins, low
capital expenditures and low working capital needs, resulting in generation of
significant cash flow from operations (before interest).

Differentiated
Value Proposition.

Our ability to deliver highly competitive everyday low
prices in a convenient location and shopping format provides our customers with
a compelling shopping experience and distinguishes us from other discount
retailers, as well as from convenience and drugstore retailers.

Compelling
Unit Economics.

The traditional Dollar General store size, design and
location requires an initial investment for fixtures, equipment, signage and
inventory of approximately $230,000. The low initial investment and maintenance
capital expenditures, when combined with strong average unit volumes, provide
for a quick recovery of store start-up costs.  The ability of our
successful stores to generate strong cash flows with minimal investment often
results in a short payback period.

Efficient
Supply Chain.

We believe our distribution network is an integral
component of our efforts to reduce transportation expenses and effectively
support our growth.  In recent years, we have made significant investments
in technological improvements and upgrades which have increased our efficiency
and capacity to support our merchandising and operations initiatives and new
store growth.

Experienced
Management Team.

In January 2008, we hired Richard Dreiling, who has
39 years of retail experience, to serve as our Chief Executive Officer.
 Over the past several years we strengthened our management team with the
hiring of David Beré, our President and Chief Strategy Officer, and Todd Vasos,
our Executive Vice President, Division President and Chief Merchandising
Officer. We also replaced a majority of our senior merchandising and real estate
teams.


Seasonality

Our
business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Generally, our highest sales
volume occurs in the fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas selling
season, and the lowest occurs in the first quarter.  In addition, our
quarterly results can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store
closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, as well as
the timing of certain holidays. We purchase substantial amounts of inventory in
the third quarter and incur higher shipping costs and higher payroll costs in
anticipation of the increased sales activity during the fourth quarter.  In
addition, we carry merchandise during our fourth quarter that we do not carry
during the rest of the year, such as gift sets, holiday decorations, certain
baking items, and a broader assortment of toys and candy.

The
following table reflects the seasonality of net sales, gross profit, and net
income (loss) by quarter for each of the quarters of the current fiscal year as
well as each of the quarters of the two most recent fiscal years. All of the
quarters reflected below are comprised of 13 weeks (see note (a) regarding
results for the second quarter of 2007).

(a)

The Merger was completed during the
second quarter of 2007. Net sales, Gross profit, and Net (loss) were $1,648.5,
$438.5 and $(42.9), respectively, for the Predecessor period from May 5, 2007 to
July 6, 2007, and were $699.1, $184.7 and $(27.2), respectively, for the
Successor period from March 6, 2007 to August 3, 2007. For comparison purposes,
these Successor results include the results of operations for Buck Acquisition
Corp. for the period prior to the Merger from March 6, 2007 (its formation)
through July 6, 2007 (reflecting the change in fair value of interest rate
swaps).

(b)

Results for the 3

rd

and

th

quarters of 2006 and all of 2007 reflect the impact of certain
strategic real estate and inventory management initiatives as discussed above in
“Overall Business Strategy.”

Merchandise

We
separate our merchandise into the following four categories for reporting
purposes: highly consumable, seasonal, home products, and basic clothing. Highly
consumable consists of packaged food, candy, snacks and refrigerated products,
health and beauty aids, home cleaning supplies and pet supplies; seasonal
consists of seasonal and holiday-related items, toys, stationery and hardware;
home products consists of housewares and domestics; and basic


clothing
consists of casual everyday apparel. The percentage of net sales of each of our
four categories of merchandise for the period indicated below was as
follows:

Our
home products and seasonal categories typically account for the highest gross
profit margin, and the highly consumable category typically accounts for the
lowest gross profit margin.

We
currently maintain approximately 7,300 core stock-keeping units, or SKUs, per
store and an additional 3,200 non-core SKUs that get rotated in and out of the
store over the course of a year.

We
purchase our merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers. Approximately 10% of
our purchases in 2008 were from The Procter & Gamble Company.  Our next
largest supplier accounted for approximately 6% of our purchases in 2008.
 We directly imported approximately 10% of our purchases at cost (14% at
retail) in 2008.

The Dollar General
Store

The
average Dollar General store has approximately 7,000 square feet of selling
space and is typically operated by a manager, an assistant manager and two or
more sales clerks. Approximately 53% are in freestanding buildings, 45% of our
stores are located in strip shopping centers and 2% are in downtown buildings.
We attempt to locate primarily in small towns or in neighborhoods of more
densely populated areas where occupancy expenses are relatively low.

We
generally have not encountered difficulty locating suitable store sites in the
past, and although management does not currently anticipate experiencing
material difficulty in finding future suitable locations, the current conditions
in the real estate and financing markets could make this process more difficult
than in recent years.


Our
recent store growth is summarized in the following table:

Employees

As
of February 27, 2009, we employed approximately 72,500 full-time and part-time
employees, including divisional and regional managers, district managers, store
managers, and DC and administrative personnel.  Management believes our
relationship with our employees is generally good, and we currently are not a
party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Competition

We
operate in the discount retail merchandise business, which is highly competitive
with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and
presentation, in-stock consistency, and customer service.  We compete with
discount stores and with many other retailers, including mass merchandise,
grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores. These other
retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many
of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. Our direct
competitors in the dollar store retail category include Family Dollar, Dollar
Tree, Fred’s, 99 Cents Only and various local, independent operators.
Competitors from other retail categories include Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite
Aid, Target and Costco, among others. Certain of our competitors have greater
financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do.

The
dollar store category differentiates itself from other forms of retailing by
offering consistently low prices in a convenient, small-store format. We believe
that our prices are competitive due in part to our low cost operating structure
and the relatively limited assortment of products offered. Historically, we have
minimized labor by offering fewer price points and a reliance on simple
merchandise presentation. We maintain strong purchasing power due to our
leadership position in the dollar store retail category and our focused
assortment of merchandise.

Trademarks

We
own marks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office, including the trademarks Dollar General®, Dollar General Market®, Clover
Valley®, DG®, DG Guarantee® and the Dollar General price point designs, along
with variations and formatives of these trademarks as well as certain other
trademarks. We attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever
practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks.  Our
trademark registrations have various expiration dates; however, assuming that
the trademark registrations are properly renewed, they have a perpetual
duration.

ITEM
1A.

RISK
FACTORS

Investing
in our securities involves a degree of risk. Persons buying our securities
should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information
contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with
the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the risks described
below are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition or
results of operations could also be adversely affected by additional factors
that apply to all companies generally, as well as other risks that are not
currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. In any such
case, the trading price of our securities could decline or we may not be able to
make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding notes, and you may
lose all or part of your original investment. While we attempt to mitigate known
risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide
no assurance, and we make no representation, that our mitigation efforts will be
successful.

The
fact that we have substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise
additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes
in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of
our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our
outstanding debt securities.

We
have substantial debt which could have important consequences, including:

·

increasing
difficulty in making payments on our outstanding debt;

·

increasing
our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;

·

requiring
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the
payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our
ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and
future business opportunities;

·

exposing
us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations as certain of our borrowings bear
interest based on market interest rates;

·

limiting
our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital
expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or
other purposes; and


·

limiting
our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a
competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly
leveraged.

In
addition, the borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at variable
rates and other debt we incur also could be variable-rate debt.  If market
interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service
requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.  While we have
and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher
interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this
risk.  We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional
indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our Credit
Facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities.  If new
indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now
face could intensify.

Our
debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our
business.

Our
Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities contain
various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of
transactions.  These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’
ability to, among other things:

·

incur
additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred
stock;

·

pay
dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted
payments;

·

create
certain liens or encumbrances;

·

sell
assets;

·

enter
into transactions with our affiliates;

·

limit
the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us;

·

merge,
consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our
assets; and

·

designate
our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

A
breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement
governing such indebtedness.  Upon our failure to maintain compliance with
these covenants, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding
thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to
extend further credit thereunder.  If the lenders under such indebtedness
accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have
sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our other indebtedness,
including our outstanding debt securities.  We have pledged a significant
portion of our assets as collateral under our Credit Facilities.  If we
were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our


Credit
Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that
indebtedness. Additional borrowings under the ABL Facility will, if excess
availability under that facility is less than a certain amount, be subject to
the satisfaction of a specified financial ratio.  Our ability to meet this
financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot
assure you that we will meet this ratio and other covenants.

General
economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other
aspects of our business.

A
further slowdown in the economy or other economic conditions affecting
disposable consumer income, such as unemployment levels, inflation, business
conditions, fuel and other energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available
credit, interest rates, tax rates and changes in tax laws, may adversely affect
our business by reducing overall consumer spending or by causing customers to
shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to products sold
by us that are less profitable than other product choices, all of which could
result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on
inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.  Many of
those factors, as well as commodity rates, transportation costs, costs of labor,
insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, lease costs,
changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, also affect
our cost of sales and our selling, general and administrative expenses, and we
have no control or limited ability to control such factors

.

In
addition, many of the factors discussed above, along with current global
economic conditions and uncertainties, the potential impact of the current
recession, the potential for additional failures or realignments of financial
institutions, and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our
suppliers and other business partners, landlords, and customers in an adverse
manner including, but not limited to, reducing access to liquid funds or credit
(including through the loss of one or more financial institutions that are a
part of our revolving credit facility), increasing the cost of credit, limiting
our ability to manage interest rate risk, increasing the risk of bankruptcy of
our suppliers, landlords or counterparties to or other financial institutions
involved in our credit facilities and our derivative and other contracts,
increasing the cost of goods to us, and other impacts which we are unable to
fully anticipate. See also our disclosures under Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” below.

Our
plans depend significantly on initiatives designed to improve the efficiencies,
costs and effectiveness of our operations, and failure to achieve or sustain
these plans could affect our performance adversely.

We
have had, and expect to continue to have, initiatives (such as those relating to
marketing, merchandising, promotions, sourcing, shrink, private brand, store
operations and real estate) in various stages of testing, evaluation, and
implementation, upon which we expect to rely to improve our results of
operations and financial condition. These initiatives are inherently risky and
uncertain, even when tested successfully, in their application to our business
in general. It is possible that successful testing can result partially from
resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation.
Testing and general implementation also can be affected


by
other risk factors described herein that reduce the results expected. Successful
systemwide implementation relies on consistency of training, stability of
workforce, ease of execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can
influence results adversely. Failure to achieve successful implementation of our
initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management’s estimates
could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Risks
associated with the domestic and foreign suppliers from whom our products are
sourced could adversely affect our financial performance.

The
products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international
suppliers. Approximately 10% of our purchases in 2008 were from The
Procter & Gamble Company. Our next largest supplier accounted for
approximately 6% of our purchases in 2008. We directly imported approximately
10% of our purchases at cost in 2008, but many of our domestic vendors directly
import their products or components of their products. Political and economic
instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the
financial instability of suppliers, suppliers’ failure to meet our supplier
standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw
materials to suppliers, merchandise quality or safety issues, currency exchange
rates, transport availability and cost, inflation, and other factors relating to
the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they
import are beyond our control. In addition, the United States’ foreign trade
policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions
imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types
of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other
factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. Disruptions due to
labor stoppages, strikes or slowdowns, or other disruptions, involving our
vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect
our ability to receive merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales. These
and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could
adversely affect our financial performance.

All
of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are
dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety
standards.  Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers
may be hindered by the manufacturers’ lack of understanding of U.S. product
liability or other laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to
respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of
the products.

As
we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors, the risks
associated with foreign imports will increase.

We
are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A
significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a
material adverse effect on our financial performance.

Our
business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations.
 New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations,
particularly those governing the sale of products, may require extensive system
and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our
cost of doing business. In addition, such changes or new laws


may
require the write off and disposal of existing product inventory, resulting in
significant adverse financial impact to the Company.  Untimely compliance
or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution
of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties,
including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, in
addition to reputational damage.

Litigation
may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our
business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers,
suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through
private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions
or other litigation. The number of employment-related class actions filed each
year has continued to increase, and recent changes in Federal law may cause
claims to rise even more.  The outcome of litigation, particularly class
action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is
difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek
recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the
potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial
periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to
us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial
statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes
to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may
be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation
that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of
whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As
a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations. See the disclosure under the heading “Legal Proceedings”
in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein for further details
regarding certain of these pending matters.

Failure
to attract and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well
as other labor issues, could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our
future growth and performance depends on our ability to attract, retain and
motivate qualified employees, many of whom are in positions with historically
high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling
our labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including the competition
for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment
levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health
and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor legislation
(including changes in the process for our employees to join a union) or other
workplace regulation (including changes in entitlement programs such as health
insurance and paid leave programs). To the extent a significant portion of our
employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could
increase. Our ability to pass along labor costs is constrained.

Also,
our stores are decentralized and are managed through a network of geographically
dispersed management personnel. Our inability to effectively and efficiently
operate our stores, including the ability to control losses resulting from
inventory and cash shrinkage, may negatively affect our sales and/or operating
margins.


We
are dependent upon the smooth functioning of our distribution network, the
capacity of our distribution centers, and the timely receipt of inventory.

We
rely upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to our
distribution centers from vendors and from the distribution centers to our
stores by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea and truck.
Labor shortages in the transportation industry could negatively affect
transportation costs. In addition, long-term disruptions to the national and
international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions
of service would adversely affect our business.

Our
planned future growth will be impeded, which would adversely affect sales, if we
cannot open new stores on schedule or if we close a number of stores materially
in excess of anticipated levels.

Our
growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the
ability to open profitable new stores. Our ability to timely open new stores and
to expand into additional market areas depends in part on the following factors:
the availability of attractive store locations; the absence of occupancy delays;
the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms; the ability to hire and train
new personnel, especially store managers; the ability to identify customer
demand in different geographic areas; general economic conditions; and the
availability of sufficient funds for expansion. In addition, many of these
factors affect our ability to successfully relocate stores. Many of these
factors are beyond our control. In addition, our substantial debt, particularly
combined with the recent tightening of the credit markets, has made it more
difficult for our real estate developers to obtain loans for our build-to-suit
stores and to locate investors for those properties after they have been
developed. If this trend continues, it could materially adversely impact our
ability to open build-to-suit stores in desirable locations.

Delays
or failures in opening new stores, or achieving lower than expected sales in new
stores, or drawing a greater than expected proportion of sales in new stores
from existing stores, could materially adversely affect our growth. In addition,
we may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our
operations and, as a result, may not meet our targets for opening new stores,
remodeling or relocating stores or expanding profitably.

Some
of our new stores may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful
experience. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market
conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our
existing markets, which may cause our new stores to be less successful than
stores in our existing markets.

Some
of our new stores will be located in areas where we have existing units.
Although we have experience in these markets, increasing the number of locations
in these markets may result in inadvertent over-saturation of markets and
temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores,
thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance.


Because
our business is seasonal to a certain extent, with the highest volume of net
sales during the fourth quarter, adverse events during the fourth quarter could
materially affect our financial statements as a whole.

We
generally recognize our highest volume of net sales during the Christmas selling
season, which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In anticipation
of this holiday, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire
many temporary employees. A seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could
result if our net sales during the Christmas selling season were to fall below
either seasonal norms or expectations. If our fourth quarter results were
substantially below expectations, our financial performance and operating
results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, especially in
seasonal merchandise. Lower than anticipated sales in the Christmas selling
season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal
labor costs.

We
face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely
impact our financial performance.

The
retail business is highly competitive. We operate in the discount retail
merchandise business, which is competitive with respect to price, store
location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock
consistency, and customer service. This competitive environment subjects us to
the risk of adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower
prices, and thus the lower margins, required to maintain our competitive
position. Also, companies operating in the discount retail merchandise sector
(due to customer demographics and other factors) may have limited ability to
increase prices in response to increased costs (including, but not limited to,
vendor price increases). This limitation may adversely affect our margins and
financial performance. We compete for customers, employees, store sites,
products and services and in other important aspects of our business with many
other local, regional and national retailers. We compete with retailers
operating discount, mass merchandise, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and
other specialty stores. Certain of our competitors have greater financial,
distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. These other competitors
compete in a variety of ways, including aggressive promotional activities,
merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location,
store hours, in-store amenities and price. If we fail to respond effectively to
competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets, it could adversely
affect our financial performance. See “Business—Our Industry, —Competitive
Strengths, and —Competition” for additional discussion of our competitive
situation.

Competition
for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors have moved
into, or increased their presence in, our geographic markets. We remain
vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of
these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could
venture into the “dollar store” industry in a significant way. Generally, we
expect an increase in competition.


Natural
disasters, unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, boycotts
and geo-political events could adversely affect our financial performance.

The
occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes,
unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, boycotts and
geo-political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers
are located and acts of terrorism, or similar disruptions could adversely affect
our operations and financial performance. These events could result in physical
damage to one or more of our properties, increases in fuel (or other energy)
prices or a fuel shortage, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more of
our stores or distribution centers, delays in opening new stores, the temporary
lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term
disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas suppliers, the
temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the
delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the temporary reduction
in the availability of products in our stores and disruption to our information
systems. These events also can have indirect consequences such as increases in
the costs of insurance following a destructive hurricane season. These factors
could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and financial
performance.

The
efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent upon our information
systems.

We
depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient
functioning of our business. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption
from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses,
security breaches, and natural disasters.  Damage or interruption to our
computer systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace them,
and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material
interruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of
operations.

We
also rely heavily on our information technology staff. If we cannot meet our
staffing needs in this area, we may not be able to fulfill our technology
initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems.
 We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade
many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. The
software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by
independent software developers. The inability of these developers or us to
continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs
would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to
convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. In addition,
costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the
implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or
adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency
of our operations.


Our
current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively
affect our financial performance.

Our
insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of
liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the
dispersion of our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur
but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically
reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain
other crime and some natural disasters. If we incur these losses and they are
material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in
sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability
of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To
offset negative insurance market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept
higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market
changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses
under our workers’ compensation, automobile liability, general liability and
group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable
actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded
liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and
indemnity costs, could result in materially different amounts of expense than
expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. Although we continue to maintain
property insurance for catastrophic events, we are effectively self-insured for
losses up to the amount of our deductibles. If we experience a greater number of
these losses than we anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely
affected.

The
Investors control us and may have conflicts of interest with us now or in the
future.

The
Investors indirectly own, through their investment in Parent, a substantial
portion of our common stock.  As a result, the Investors have control over
our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent
any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether others
believe that the transaction is in our best interests.  For example, the
Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the amount of
indebtedness that is secured or that is senior to our outstanding notes or to
sell assets, which may impair our ability to make payments under our outstanding
notes.

The
Investors are also in the business of making investments in companies and may
from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly
or indirectly with us. The Investors may also pursue acquisition opportunities
that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us.  So long as the Investors, or
other funds controlled by or associated with the Investors, continue to
indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock, even if
such amount is less than 50%, the Investors will continue to be able to strongly
influence or effectively control our decisions.

PROPERTIES

As
of February 27, 2009, we operated 8,414 retail stores located in 35 states as
follows:

Most
of our stores are located in leased premises.  Individual store leases vary
as to their terms, rental provisions and expiration dates.  The majority of
our leases are relatively low-cost, short-term leases (usually with current
terms of three to five years) often with multiple renewal options. We also have
stores subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which typically
carry a primary lease term of 10 years with multiple renewal options. In recent
years, an increasing percentage of our new stores have been subject to
build-to-suit arrangements. In 2008, approximately 85% of our new stores were
build-to-suit arrangements.

As
of February 27, 2009, we operated nine distribution centers, as described in the
following table:

We
lease the distribution centers located in Oklahoma, Mississippi and Missouri and
own the other six distribution centers. Approximately 7.25 acres of the land on
which our Kentucky distribution center is located is subject to a ground lease.
We lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our
distribution needs.


Our
executive offices are located in approximately 302,000 square feet of leased
space in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.

February 1, 2008, July 6, 2007 and February 2, 2007, and balance sheet data as
of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008 have been derived from our historical
audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The
selected historical statement of operations data and statement of cash flows
data for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005 and
balance sheet data as of February 2, 2007, February 3, 2006 and January 28, 2005
presented in this table have been derived from audited consolidated financial
statements not included in this report.

On
July 6, 2007, we completed a merger (the “Merger”) and, as a result, we are a
subsidiary of a Delaware limited partnership controlled by investment funds
affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P. As a result of the
Merger of the Company and Buck Acquisition Corp. (“Buck”), the related purchase
accounting adjustments, and a new basis of accounting beginning on July 7, 2007,
the 2007 financial reporting periods presented below include the Predecessor
period of the Company reflecting 22 weeks of operating results from February 3,
2007 to July 6, 2007 and 30 weeks of operating results for the Successor period,
reflecting the Merger from July 7, 2007 to February 1, 2008.  Buck’s
results of operations for the period from March 6, 2007 to July 6, 2007 (prior
to the Merger on July 6, 2007) are also included in the consolidated financial
statements for the 2007 Successor period described above, as a result of certain
derivative financial instruments entered into by Buck prior to the Merger. Other
than these financial instruments, Buck had no assets, liabilities, or operations
prior to the Merger. The fiscal years presented from 2004 to 2006 reflect the
Predecessor.

Due
to the significance of the Merger and related transactions that occurred in
2007, the 2008 and 2007 Successor financial information is not comparable to
that of the Predecessor periods presented in the accompanying table.

The

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

Accounting
Periods

.  The following text contains references to years 2009, 2008,
2007, and 2006, which represent fiscal years ending or ended January 29, 2010,
January 30, 2009, February 1, 2008, and February 2, 2007, respectively. Our
fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2008 and 2006
were 52-week accounting periods  As discussed below, we completed a merger
transaction on July 6, 2007, and therefore the 2007 presentation includes the
22-week Predecessor period of Dollar General Corporation through July 6, 2007,
reflecting the historical basis of accounting prior to the Merger, and a 30-week
Successor period, reflecting the impact of the business combination and
associated purchase price allocation of the merger of Dollar General Corporation
and Buck Acquisition Corp. (“Buck”), from July 7, 2007 to February 1, 2008.
 Buck was formed on March 6, 2007, and its results of operations prior to
the Merger, related solely to interest rate swaps entered into in anticipation
of the Merger, are included in the 2007 Successor results of operations.
Transactions relating to or resulting from the Merger are discussed separately.
This discussion and analysis should be read with, and is qualified in its
entirety by, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto. It
also should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements/Risk
Factors disclosures set forth in the Introduction and in Item 1A of this
report.

Purpose
of Discussion

. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with
information that will assist in understanding our company and the critical
economic factors that affect our company. In addition, it should help the reader
understand our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those
financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that accounted for
those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial
statements.

Our 2007
Merger

On
July 6, 2007, we completed a merger (the “Merger”) and, as a result, we are a
subsidiary of Buck Holdings, L.P. (“Parent”), a Delaware limited partnership
controlled by investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., L.P. (“KKR” or “Sponsor”). KKR, GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. and
affiliated funds (affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co.), Citi Private
Equity, Wellington Management Company, LLP, CPP Investment Board (USRE II) Inc.,
and other equity co-investors (collectively, the “Investors”) indirectly own a
substantial portion of our capital stock through their investment in Parent.

The
Merger consideration was funded through the use of our available cash, cash
equity contributions from the Investors, equity contributions of certain members
of our management and the debt financings discussed below. Our outstanding
common stock is now owned by Parent and certain members of management. Our
common stock is no longer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and is no longer traded on a national securities exchange.


We
entered into the following debt financings in conjunction with the Merger:

·

A
credit agreement and related security and other agreements consisting of a
$2.3 billion senior secured term loan facility, which matures on
July 6, 2014 (the “Term Loan Facility”).

·

A
credit agreement and related security and other agreements consisting of a
senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to
$1.125 billion subject to borrowing base availability, which matures
July 6, 2013 (the “ABL Facility” and, with the Term Loan Facility, the
“Credit Facilities”).

·

$1.175 billion
aggregate principal amount of 10.625% senior notes due 2015, which mature on
July 15, 2015, and $725 million aggregate principal amount of
11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017, which mature on
July 15, 2017. We have repurchased $69.1 million of the senior subordinated
toggle notes since the Merger.

Executive
Overview

We
are the largest discount retailer in the United States by number of stores, with
approximately 8,400 stores located in 35 states, primarily in the southern,
southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. We serve a broad customer
base and offer a focused assortment of everyday items, including basic
consumable merchandise and other home, apparel and seasonal products. A majority
of our products are priced at $10 or less, and approximately 25% of our products
are priced at $1 or less. We seek to offer a compelling value proposition for
our customers based on convenient store locations, easy in and out shopping and
quality merchandise in a friendly shopping environment at highly competitive
prices. We believe our combination of value and convenience distinguishes us
from other discount, convenience and drugstore retailers, who typically focus on
either value or convenience.

The
nature of our business is seasonal to a certain extent. Primarily because of
sales of holiday-related merchandise, sales in our fourth quarter (November,
December and January) have historically been higher than sales achieved in each
of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses and, to a greater
extent, operating income vary by quarter. Results of a period shorter than a
full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year.
Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between
periods. It is important for you to read our more detailed discussion of
financial and operating results below under “Results of Operations.” Basis
points or “bps” amounts referred to below are equal to 0.01 percent as a
percentage of sales.

The
customers we serve are value-conscious, and Dollar General has always been
intently focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending
dollars. In 2008, consumers faced severe economic challenges, including high
gasoline and fuel costs, rising food costs, increased unemployment, and the
downturn in the housing and credit markets.  We believe that we benefited
to some extent from the impact of consumers searching for good values on their
basic purchases.


At
the beginning of 2008, we defined four operating priorities as follows: 1) drive
productive sales growth, 2) increase our gross margins, 3) leverage process
improvements and information technology to reduce costs, and 4) strengthen and
expand Dollar General's culture of serving others. These continue to be our
principal operating priorities in 2009.  Coupled with the changes we made
to our operations during the year in connection with these priorities, which are
discussed in more detail below, we achieved the following financial highlights
in fiscal 2008:

·

Total
sales in fiscal 2008 were $10.5 billion, a 10.1% increase from 2007. Sales in
same-stores increased 9.0% and were driven by increases in customer traffic and
average transaction amount. Average sales per square foot for all stores in 2008
were approximately $180, up from $165 in 2007. Sales increases of highly
consumable products outpaced our more discretionary categories, likely the
result of both our merchandising initiatives, which were more focused on
consumables, and the negative effect of the economy on consumer discretionary
spending.

·

Gross
profit, as a percentage of sales, was 29.3% in 2008. During the year, we made
progress in reducing our inventory shrinkage and improving the efficiencies of
our distribution and transportation processes as well as leveraging fixed
distribution costs. Improvements in our pricing systems and processes also
permitted us to make more timely price changes to compensate for unavoidable
cost increases, and for the year, markdowns declined.

·

SG&A,
as a percentage of sales, for fiscal 2008 was 23.4%. This compares to 23.8% in
the 2007 Successor period and 24.5% in the 2007 Predecessor period. Our
increased sales levels favorably impacted SG&A, as a percentage of sales, in
addition to a reduction in workers’ compensation expense, resulting from safety
initiatives implemented over the last several years, and reduced advertising
expense. The 2007 Predecessor period included SG&A of $45.0 million, or 115
basis points, related to closing underperforming stores.

·

We
recorded litigation expense of $32 million to reflect the settlement and related
expenses, net of insurance proceeds, of a class action lawsuit filed as a result
of the Merger in 2007. We determined that the settlement was in our best
interests to avoid costly and time consuming litigation.

·

Interest
expense of $391.9 million in 2008 relates primarily to interest on debt incurred
to finance the Merger. We repaid all borrowings under our revolving credit
facility in the first quarter of 2008 and incurred no additional borrowings
during the year. In January 2009, we further reduced our total long-term
obligations by repurchasing $44.1 million of senior subordinated notes.

·

For
fiscal 2008, we reported net income of $108.2 million. This compares to a net
loss of $4.8 million in the 2007 Successor period and a net loss of $8.0 million
in the 2007 Predecessor period, each of which included significant costs related
to the Merger and other strategic initiatives as more fully described in the
discussion below of 2008 vs 2007.


·

We
generated $575.2 million of cash from operating activities, a portion of which
we used to invest in our stores and to reduce long-term obligations. At year
end, our cash balance of $378 million included $310 million invested in money
market funds. Because of uncertainties in the current financial markets, we
believe maintaining excess liquidity is prudent.

·

During
2008, we opened 207 new stores, remodeled or relocated 404 stores, and closed 39
stores, resulting in a store count of 8,362 on January 30, 2009. In addition, we
are pleased with the progress we made during the year in our efforts to better
utilize existing square footage and to improve the appearance of our stores.

Discussion
of Operating Priorities.

Our first priority is driving productive
sales growth by increasing shopper frequency and transaction amount and
maximizing sales per square foot. We utilized numerous initiatives in 2008 to
enable productive sales growth. For example, we are defining and improving our
store standards with a goal of developing a consistent look and feel across all
stores. We expanded convenience foods and beverages, added new impulse racks at
the checkout stands, and expanded our store operating hours. To further increase
space utilization, we have begun the process of raising the height of
merchandise fixtures in our stores, starting with the food area.

Our
second priority is to increase gross profit through shrink reduction,
distribution efficiencies, an improved pricing model, the expansion of private
brand offerings and increased foreign sourcing. In 2008, inventory shrink
decreased as a result of several focused initiatives, including the elimination
of packaway inventories from the stockrooms, the installation of additional
security cameras, the implementation of exception-based shrink detection tools,
and improved hiring practices and employee retention. In 2008, higher sales
volumes contributed to our ability to leverage transportation and distribution
costs, and we were able to offset the impact of higher average fuel costs for
the year through better trailer utilization, expansion of backhaul opportunities
and improved fleet management. We reviewed and reset our consumables planograms,
eliminating less productive items in order to add more productive ones. In this
process, we reviewed our pricing strategy and worked diligently to minimize
vendor cost increases. Some merchandise cost increases were unavoidable in 2008,
but as a result of our improved pricing analysis tools, we were able to recoup a
portion of these increases through pricing. We continue to focus on sales of
private brand consumables, which generally have higher gross profit rates, while
continuing to offer a wide variety of national brands in our efforts to offer
the optimal mix of products to our customers. With regard to the expansion of
foreign sourcing, we are still in the early stages of defining the objectives
and building the team.

Our
third priority is leveraging process improvements and information technology to
reduce costs.  We are committed as an organization to extract costs that do
not affect the customer experience.  Examples of cost reduction initiatives
in 2008 include recycling of cardboard, reduction of workers compensation
expense through a focus on safety, and improvement of energy management in the
stores through installation and monitoring of new equipment. With regard to
information technology, we are focusing our resources on improving systems that
are designed to enhance retail store operations and merchandising.


Our
fourth priority is to strengthen and expand Dollar General's culture of serving
others. For customers this means helping them Save Time. Save Money. Every Day.
 For employees, this means creating an environment that attracts and
retains key employees throughout the organization. For communities, this means
giving back to our store communities.

In
2009, we plan to continue to focus on these same four operating priorities. We
will continue to refine and improve our store standards, focusing on achieving a
consistent look and feel across the chain, and plan to measure customer
satisfaction in 2009. We expect to complete the process of raising the height of
our merchandise fixtures, allowing us to better utilize our store square
footage. We will continue to focus on reducing inventory shrink by implementing
additional analytical tools and expanding the utilization of surveillance
equipment. We have identified additional opportunities to reduce labor and other
costs in our distribution centers. In addition, we plan to continue to expand
our private brand consumables offerings and to increase and upgrade our private
brand merchandise in the home and seasonal categories. We intend to make strides
in expanding our foreign sourcing efforts and expect to begin seeing a greater
impact from this initiative in late 2009.

With
regard to leveraging information technology and process improvements to reduce
costs, we will continue to focus on making improvements that benefit our
merchandising and operations efforts, including projects such as pricing and
profitability analysis, merchandise selection and allocation and labor
scheduling. By the end of 2009, we expect each of our store managers to have
access to a back office computer which will improve reporting and communications
with the stores and, consequently, should assist us in improving store
productivity.

Finally,
in 2009, we plan to open 450 new stores within the 35 states in which we
currently operate, and to remodel or relocate an additional 400 stores. With
regard to planned new store openings, our criteria are based on numerous factors
including, among other things, availability of appropriate sites, expected
sales, lease terms, population demographics, competition, and the employment
environment. We use various real estate site selection tools to determine target
markets and optimum site locations within those markets. With regard to new
store expansion in fiscal 2009, our plans include expansion only within our
existing markets. With respect to store relocations, we begin to evaluate a
store for relocation opportunities approximately 18 months prior to the store’s
lease expiration using the same basic tools and criteria as those used for new
stores. Remodels, which require a much smaller investment, are determined based
on the need, the opportunity for sales improvement at the location and an
expectation of a desirable return on investment.  The majority of 2009’s
new store sites have been identified and terms agreed to. However, due to
uncertainties in the economy and its potential impact on commercial real estate
sites and developers, there is a heightened level of risk that these stores may
not open as scheduled.

We
expect to continue to face difficult economic issues in 2009 which will restrict
our customers’ ability to spend and, therefore, will challenge our efforts to
increase sales and gross profit. We also believe that competitive pricing,
promotions, and advertising will continue and are likely to increase if overall
retail sales continue to decline. We remain committed to our


operating
model and to making improvements in our stores and our merchandise to better
serve the needs of our customers.

Readers
should refer to the detailed discussion of our operating results below for
additional comments on financial performance in the current year periods as
compared with the prior year periods.


Results
of Operations

The
following table contains results of operations data for fiscal year 2008, the
Successor and Predecessor periods in 2007, and fiscal year 2006.

(a)

Includes the results of operations of
Buck Acquisition Corp. for the period prior to its Merger with and into Dollar
General Corporation from March 6, 2007 (its formation) through July 6, 2007
(reflecting the change in fair value of interest rate swaps), and the
post-Merger results of Dollar General Corporation for the period from July 7,
2007 through February 1, 2008.

(b)

Includes the pre-Merger results of
Dollar General Corporation for the period from February 3, 2007 through July 6,
2007.

(c)

Includes the impacts of certain
strategic real estate and inventory management initiatives as described under
the heading “Strategic Initiatives—Project Alpha” in Item 1 above.


The
following discussion of our financial performance also includes supplemental
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for fiscal
years 2007 and 2006. Because the Merger occurred during our 2007 second quarter,
we believe this information aids in the comparison between the years presented.
The pro forma information does not purport to represent what our results of
operations would have been had the Merger and related transactions actually
occurred at the beginning of the years indicated, and they do not purport to
project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period.
The following table contains results of operations data for 2008 compared to pro
forma results of operations for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, and the dollar and
percentage variances among those years. See

“Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” below.


Net
Sales

. The net sales increase in fiscal 2008 reflects a same-store sales
increase of 9% compared to 2007. Same-stores include stores that have been open
for 13 months and remain open at the end of the reporting period. For the 2008
fiscal year, there were 8,153 same-stores which accounted for sales of $10.12
billion. There were no purchase accounting or other adjustments to net sales as
a result of the Merger, therefore, the 2007 net sales and other amounts
presented related to 2007 net sales are calculated using the 2007 52-week fiscal
year.

The remainder of the increase in sales in fiscal 2008 was
attributable to new stores, partially offset by sales from closed stores. The
increase in highly consumable sales reflects the various initiatives implemented
in 2008, including the impact of improved store standards, the expansion of
convenience food and beverage offerings, improved utilization of square footage
and extended store hours. The majority of our merchandising efforts in 2008
related to the highly consumable category, including planogram resets and
increased emphasis on private brand products as further discussed above in the
Executive Overview. Both the number of customer transactions and average
transaction amount increased for the year. and we believe that our stores
benefited to some degree from attracting new customers who are seeking value as
a result of the current economic environment.

The
net sales increase in 2007 primarily reflects a same-store sales increase of
1.9% for the 2007 Successor period and 2.6% for the Predecessor period compared
to the same periods in 2006.  For the 2007 Successor period, there were
7,735 same-stores (generating $5.26 billion of net sales) and for the 2007
Predecessor period, there were 7,655 same-stores (generating $3.66 billion of
net sales).  Sales resulting from new store growth, including 170 new
stores in the 2007 Successor period and 195 stores in the 2007 Predecessor
period, were partially offset by the impact of store closings in the 2007
Predecessor and Successor periods and in 2006. Sales of highly consumables were
66.4% of total sales in the 2007 Successor period and 66.6% of total sales in
the 2007 Predecessor period, compared to 65.7% of total sales in 2006, resulting
from successful changes during the 2007 periods to our consumables merchandising
mix. Sales of seasonal merchandise increased slightly in dollars but declined as
a percentage of total sales in the 2007 periods compared to 2006. Apparel sales
increased as a percentage of total sales in the 2007 periods compared to 2006,
while home products sales decreased as a percentage of sales. To some extent,
sales in these more discretionary categories were impacted by our efforts to
eliminate our inventory packaway strategy by the end of 2007 and to reduce
overall inventory levels. In addition, we believe sales of seasonal merchandise,
apparel and home products were negatively affected by continued economic
pressures on our customers, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2007. The
increase in same-store sales represents an increase in average customer
purchase, offset by a slight decrease in customer traffic.

As
discussed above, we monitor our sales internally by the following four major
categories: highly consumable, seasonal, home products and basic clothing. The
highly consumable category has a lower gross profit rate than the other three
categories and has grown significantly over the past several years. Because of
the impact of sales mix on gross profit, we continually review our merchandise
mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate. Maintaining an appropriate sales
mix is an integral part of achieving our gross profit and sales goals.

Gross
Profit

. The gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 29.3% in 2008
compared to 28.2% in the 2007 Successor period, 27.3% in the 2007 Predecessor
period, and 27.8% for pro


forma
2007. Factors contributing to the increase in the 2008 gross profit rate include
a lower inventory shrink rate; lower promotional markdowns; improved leverage on
distribution and transportation costs; and improved markups related to changes
resulting from the outcome of pricing analysis, our ability to react more
quickly to product cost changes and diligent vendor negotiations. In January
2009, we marked down merchandise as the result of a recent change in the
interpretation of the phthalates provision of the Consumer Product Safety
Improvement Act of 2008 resulting in a charge of $8.6 million. Also in 2008, we
faced increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet products
which have been driven by rising fruit and vegetable prices and freight costs.
 Increases in petroleum, resin, metals, pulp and other raw material
commodity driven costs also resulted in multiple product cost increases.
 Related to these commodity cost increases, we recorded a LIFO provision of
$43.9 million in 2008, compared to the LIFO provision recorded in the 2007
Successor period of $6.1 million. We intend to address these commodity cost
increases through negotiations with our vendors and by increasing retail prices
as necessary. On a quarterly basis, we estimate the annual impact of commodity
cost fluctuations based upon the best available information at that point in
time.

The
gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was 27.3% in the 2007 Predecessor
period, 28.2% in the 2007 Successor period, and 27.8% in pro forma 2007 compared
to 25.8% in 2006. Factors affecting the increase in the gross profit rate
include: lower markdowns, including markdowns from retail and below cost
markdowns (markdowns in 2006 included significant markdowns and below cost
adjustments relating to the move away from our packaway inventory strategy); and
improved leverage on distribution and transportation costs driven by logistics
efficiencies. The gross profit rate in the 2007 Successor period was greater
than in the Predecessor period, in part due to the seasonality of our sales
which result in greater sales of higher margin discretionary purchases in the
fourth quarter. Offsetting the factors listed above was an increase in our
shrink rate in the 2007 periods as compared to 2006 and a shift in the mix of
sales to more highly consumable products which have relatively lower gross
profit rates.

Selling,
General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expense

.  SG&A expense as a
percentage of sales decreased to 23.4% in 2008, compared to 23.8% and 24.5% in
the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods, respectively.  The more
significant items resulting in the decrease in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods
include: approximately $9.0 million and $45.0 million in the 2007 Successor and
Predecessor periods, respectively (including $2.4 million and $4.1 million,
respectively, also included in advertising costs discussed below) relating to
the closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy;
$40.5 million in 2008 compared to $23.4 million in the 2007 Successor period
related to amortization of leasehold intangibles capitalized in connection with
the revaluation of assets at the date of the Merger; a $12.0 million loss in the
2007 Successor period compared to a $5.0 million gain in 2008 relating to
potential losses on distribution center leases; advertising costs of $27.8
million in 2008 compared to $23.6 million and $17.3 million in the 2007
Successor and Predecessor periods, respectively; and decreases in workers
compensation and other insurance-related costs compared to the 2007 periods.
These decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation
and related payroll taxes in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods due to improved
overall financial performance and an increase in professional fees in 2008
compared to the 2007 periods primarily reflecting legal expenses related to
shareholder litigation.


SG&A
decreased to 23.4% in 2008 compared to 24.3% in pro forma 2007.  The more
significant items resulting in the decrease from the 2007 pro forma results
include: $54.0 million of costs in pro forma 2007 SG&A relating to the
closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy; a
$12.0 million loss in the 2007 pro forma period compared to a $5.0 million gain
in 2008 relating to possible losses on distribution center leases; and decreases
in workers compensation and other insurance-related costs in 2008 of $10.4
million compared to the 2007 pro forma period. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in incentive compensation and related payroll taxes of
$42.0 million in 2008 compared to pro forma 2007 due to improved overall
financial performance and an increase in professional fees in 2008 of $10.4
million compared to pro forma 2007 primarily reflecting legal expenses related
to shareholder litigation.

SG&A
expense increased as a percentage of sales to 23.8% in the 2007 Successor period
and 24.5% in the 2007 Predecessor period from 23.1% in 2006. SG&A in the
2007 periods includes: $23.4 million in the 2007 Successor period related to
amortization of leasehold intangibles capitalized in connection with the
revaluation of assets at the date of the Merger; $19.3 million and $7.6 million
of administrative employee incentive compensation expense in the 2007 Successor
and Predecessor periods, respectively, resulting from meeting certain financial
targets (compared to $9.6 million of discretionary bonuses in 2006);
approximately $9.0 million and $45.0 million of expenses in the 2007 Successor
and Predecessor periods, respectively, relating to the closing of stores and the
elimination of our packaway inventory strategy (compared to approximately $33
million in 2006) and an accrued loss of approximately $12.0 million in the 2007
Successor period relating to probable losses for certain distribution center
leases. In addition, SG&A in the 2007 Successor period includes
approximately $4.8 million of KKR-related consulting and monitoring fees.
SG&A expense in 2006 was partially offset by insurance proceeds of $13.0
million received during the year related to losses incurred due to Hurricane
Katrina.

On
a pro forma basis, SG&A expense increased as a percentage of sales to 24.3%
in 2007 compared to 23.8% in 2006. Pro forma SG&A includes: $26.9 million of
administrative employee incentive compensation expense in 2007 resulting from
meeting certain financial targets, compared to $9.6 million of discretionary
bonuses in 2006; approximately $54 million of expenses in 2007 relating to the
closing of stores and the elimination of our packaway inventory strategy,
compared to approximately $33 million in 2006; and an accrued loss of
approximately $12.0 million in 2007 relating to probable losses for certain
distribution center leases. SG&A expense in 2006 was partially offset by
insurance proceeds of $13.0 million received during the year related to losses
incurred due to Hurricane Katrina.

Litigation
Settlement and Related Costs, Net.

The $32.0 million in 2008 represents the
settlement of a class action lawsuit filed in response to the Merger, and
includes a $40.0 million settlement and estimated expenses of $2.0 million, net
of $10.0 million of insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of
2008.

Transaction
and Related Costs.

The $1.2 million and $101.4 million of expenses recorded
in the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods reflect $1.2 million and $62.0
million, respectively, of expenses related to the Merger, such as investment
banking and legal fees as


well
as $39.4 million of compensation expense in the Predecessor period related to
stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units which were fully
vested immediately prior to and as a result of the Merger.

Interest
Income.

Interest income consists primarily of interest on investments. The
decrease in interest income in 2008 compared to the 2007 periods was a result of
lower interest rates, partially offset by higher investments. In the 2007
periods (primarily the 2007 Predecessor period) we had higher levels of cash and
short term investments on hand as compared to 2006.

Interest
Expense

. The significant increase in interest expense in 2008 and the 2007
Successor period subsequent to the Merger is due to interest on long-term
obligations incurred to finance the Merger. See further discussion under
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.  We had outstanding variable-rate
debt of $623 million and $787 million, after taking into consideration the
impact of interest rate swaps, as of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008,
respectively. The remainder of our outstanding indebtedness at January 30, 2009
and February 1, 2008 was fixed rate debt.

Interest
expense in 2008 was less than 2007 pro forma interest expense due to lower
borrowing amounts, specifically on the revolving credit agreement and senior
subordinated notes, along with lower interest rates. Pro forma interest expense
for both 2007 and 2006 was approximately $437 million.

Other
(Income) Expense.

In 2008, we recorded a gain of $3.8 million resulting from
the repurchase of $44.1 million of our senior subordinated notes, offset by
expense of $1.0 million related to hedge ineffectiveness related to certain
interest rate swaps.

During
the 2007 Successor period, we recorded an unrealized loss of $4.1 million
related to the change in the fair value of interest swaps prior to the
designation of such swaps as cash flow hedges in October 2007, offset by
earnings of $1.7 million under the contractual provisions of the swap
agreements. Also during the 2007 Successor period, we recorded $6.2 million of
expenses related to consent fees and other costs associated with a tender offer
for certain notes payable maturing in June 2010 (“2010 Notes”). Approximately
99% of the 2010 Notes were retired as a result of the tender offer. The costs
related to the tender of the 2010 Notes were partially offset by a $4.9 million
gain in the 2007 Successor period resulting from the repurchase of $25.0 million
of our senior subordinated notes.

Income
Taxes

.  The effective income tax rates for 2008, the 2007 Successor and
Predecessor periods and 2006 were an expense of 44.4%, a benefit of 26.9% and
expense of 300.2%, and 37.4%, respectively.

The
2008 income tax rate is greater than the expected U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%
principally due to the non-deductibility of the settlement and related expenses
associated with the Merger-related shareholder lawsuit.

The
income tax rate for the Successor period ended February 1, 2008 is a benefit of
26.9%.  This benefit is less than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 35%
due to the incurrence of state income taxes in several of the group’s
subsidiaries that file their state income tax returns on


a
separate entity basis and the election to include, effective February 3, 2007,
income tax related interest and penalties in the amount reported as income tax
expense.

The
income tax rate for the Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007 is an expense of
300.2%.  This expense is higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of
35% due principally to the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related
expenses.

Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information

The
following supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
operations data has been developed by applying pro forma adjustments to our
historical consolidated statement of operations. We were acquired on July 6,
2007 through a merger accounted for as a reverse acquisition. Although we
continued as the same legal entity after the Merger, the accompanying unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is presented for the
Predecessor and Successor relating to the periods preceding and succeeding the
Merger, respectively. As a result of the Merger, we applied purchase accounting
standards and a new basis of accounting effective July 7, 2007. The unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the years ended
February 1, 2008 and February 2, 2007 gives effect to the Merger as if it had
occurred on February 3, 2007 and February 4, 2006, respectively. Assumptions
underlying the pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes,
which should be read in conjunction with this unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statement.

The
unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is presented
for supplemental informational purposes only, although we believe this
information is useful in providing comparisons between years. The unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated financial information does not purport to represent
what our results of operations would have been had the Merger and related
transactions actually occurred on the date indicated, and they do not purport to
project our results of operations or financial condition for any future period.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations should
be read in conjunction with the information contained in other sections of this
2008 Form 10-K including “Selected Financial Data”, in our consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto, and other sections of this
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” appearing elsewhere in this fiscal 2008 Form 10-K. All pro forma
adjustments and their underlying assumptions are described more fully in the
notes to our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations.

Notes
to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations

(a)
Represents the estimated impact on cost of goods sold of the adjustment to fair
value of the property and equipment at our distribution centers.

(b)
Primarily represents depreciation and amortization of the fair value adjustments
related to tangible and intangible long-lived assets. Identifiable intangible
assets with a determinable life have been amortized on a straight-line basis in
the unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations over a period
ranging from 2 to 17.5 years. The primary fair value adjustments (on which the
pro forma adjustments are based) impacting SG&A expenses were to leasehold
interests ($185 million), property and equipment ($101 million) and internally
developed software ($12 million). This adjustment also includes management fees
that are payable to affiliates of certain of the Investors subsequent to the
closing of the Merger and related transactions (at an initial annual rate of
$5.0 million which shall be increased by 5% for each succeeding year during the
term of the agreement).

(c)
Represents $101.4 million of charges that are non-recurring in nature and
directly attributable to the Merger and related transactions. Such charges are
comprised of $39.4 million of stock compensation expense from the acceleration
of unvested stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units as
required as a result of the Merger and $62.0 million of transaction costs we
incurred that were expensed as one-time charges upon the close of the Merger.
Such adjustments do not include any adjustments to reflect the effects of our
new stock based compensation plan.

(d)
Reflects pro forma interest expense resulting from our new capital structure as
follows (in millions):

(1) The
$1.125 billion revolving credit facility carries an interest rate of 3-month
LIBOR of 5.32% plus 1.50% for tranche A loans and 3-month LIBOR of 5.32% plus
2.25% for tranche A-1 loans. Reflects assumed borrowings of $175.0 million under
tranche A and $125.0 million under tranche A-1. Such levels of borrowings will
fluctuate in future periods dependent upon short term cash needs. Changes in the
levels of borrowings would impact interest expense.


(2)
Reflects interest on the $2.3 billion term loan facility at a rate of LIBOR plus
2.75%. To hedge against interest rate risk, we have entered into a swap
agreement with respect to a $2.0 billion notional amount for 4.93%. This swap
agreement became effective as a result of the acquisition on July 31, 2007 and
will amortize on a quarterly basis until maturity at July 31, 2012. The unhedged
portion of the facility is reflected at an interest rate of LIBOR of 5.32% plus
2.75%.

(3) Reflects
interest on the 10.625% senior notes and 11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated
notes. Assumes the cash interest payment option at a rate of 11.875% has been
elected with respect to all of the senior subordinated notes.

(4)
Represents fees on balances of trade letters of credit of $141.2 million at
0.75% and standby letters of credit of $40.7 million at 1.50%.

(5)
Represents commitment fees of 0.375% on the $612.1 million unutilized balance of
the revolving credit facility at July 6, 2007. Outstanding letters of credit
noted in (4) above reduce the availability under the revolving credit
facility.

(6)
Represents historical interest expense on other existing indebtedness.

(7)
Represents debt issuance costs associated with the new bank facilities amortized
using the effective interest method over 6 years for the revolving facility, 7
years for the term loan facility, 8 years for the senior notes, 10 years for the
senior subordinated notes and 8 years for other capitalized debt issuance costs.
Also includes the amortization of debt discount of the senior notes.

(8)
Represents interest expense on long-term liabilities which were discounted as a
result of the Merger.

(9)
Represents an adjustment to historical interest expense to reflect the effect of
the adoption of current accounting standards for income taxes, offset by
capitalized interest expense.

(e)
Represents the tax effect of the pro forma adjustments, calculated at an
effective rate of 54.1% for the Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007 and 36.7%
for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2007. The effective tax rate, a benefit,
applied to the pro forma changes for the Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007,
reflects the pro forma elimination of non-deductible transaction costs from
income before taxes. The pro forma income tax expense for the year ended
February 2, 2007 has been adjusted to reflect changes required by FIN 48 as if
FIN 48 had been adopted as of the beginning of the year.

Effects of
Inflation

In
2008, increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet products
which have been driven by fruit and vegetable prices and rising freight costs
have increased the costs of certain products. Increases in petroleum, resin,
metals, pulp and other raw material commodity driven costs also resulted in
multiple product cost increases. We believe that our ability to increase
selling prices in response to cost increases largely mitigated the effect of
these cost increases on our overall results of operations. We believe that
inflation and/or deflation had a minimal impact on our overall operations during
2007 and 2006.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Current
Financial Condition / Recent Developments

. During the past three years, we
have generated an aggregate of approximately $1.4 billion in cash flows from
operating


activities.
During that period, we expanded the number of stores we operate by approximately
5% (433 stores), remodeled or relocated over 9% of our currently operated stores
(768 stores), and incurred approximately $607 million in capital expenditures.
As noted above, we made certain strategic decisions which slowed our store
growth in 2007 and 2008, but we plan to accelerate store growth again in
2009.

At
January 30, 2009, we had total outstanding debt (including the current portion
of long-term obligations) of $4.14 billion.  We also had an additional
$932.8 million available for borrowing under our senior secured asset-based
revolving credit facility at that date.  Our liquidity needs are
significant, primarily due to our debt service and other obligations.  Our
substantial debt could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital
to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or
our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate
debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our outstanding debt
securities.

Management
believes our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances, combined with
availability under the Credit Facilities (described below), will provide
sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital
requirements and capital spending for a period that includes the next twelve
months.

Credit
Facilities

Overview.

We have two senior secured credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) which
provide financing of up to $3.425 billion. The Credit Facilities consist of a
$2.3 billion senior secured term loan facility and a senior secured asset-based
revolving credit facility of up to $1.125 billion (of which up to $350.0 million
is available for letters of credit), subject to borrowing base availability. The
asset-based revolving credit facility includes borrowing capacity available for
letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as swingline loans.

The
agreements governing the Credit Facilities provide that we have the right at any
time to request up to $325.0 million of incremental commitments under one
or more incremental term loan facilities and/or asset-based revolving credit
facilities. The lenders under these facilities are not under any obligation to
provide any such incremental commitments and any such addition of or increase in
commitments will be subject to our not exceeding certain senior secured leverage
ratios and certain other customary conditions precedent.  Our ability to
obtain extensions of credit under these incremental commitments also will be
subject to the same conditions as extensions of credit under the Credit
Facilities.

The
amount available under the senior secured asset-based credit facility (including
letters of credit) shall not exceed the sum of the tranche A borrowing base and
the tranche A-1 borrowing base. The tranche A borrowing base equals the sum of
(i) 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of all our eligible inventory
and that of each guarantor thereunder and (ii) 90% of all our accounts
receivable and credit/debit card receivables and that of each guarantor
thereunder, in each case, subject to a reserve equal to the principal amount of
the 2010 Notes that remain outstanding at any time and other customary reserves
and eligibility criteria. An


additional
10% to 12% of the net orderly liquidation value of all of our eligible inventory
and that of each guarantor thereunder is made available to us in the form of a
“last out” tranche under which we may borrow up to a maximum amount of $125.0
million. Borrowings under the asset-based credit facility will be incurred first
under the last out tranche, and no borrowings will be permitted under any other
tranche until the last out tranche is fully utilized. Repayments of the senior
secured asset-based revolving credit facility will be applied to the last out
tranche only after all other tranches have been fully paid down.

Interest
Rates and Fees.

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a
rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) LIBOR or (b)
a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate).  The applicable
margin for borrowings is (i) under the term loan facility, 2.75% for LIBOR
borrowings and 1.75% for base-rate borrowings (ii) as of January 30, 2009 and
February 1, 2008, respectively, under the asset-based revolving credit facility
(except in the last out tranche described above), 1.25% and 1.50% for LIBOR
borrowings; 0.25% and 0.50% for base-rate borrowings and for any last out
borrowings, 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.25% for base-rate borrowings.
 The applicable margins for borrowings under the asset-based revolving
credit facility (except in the case of last out borrowings) are subject to
adjustment each quarter based on average daily excess availability under the
asset-based revolving credit facility.  We are also required to pay a
commitment fee to the lenders under the asset-based revolving credit facility
for any unutilized commitments at a rate of 0.375% per annum.  We also must
pay customary letter of credit fees. See Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk” below for a discussion of our use of interest
rate swaps to manage our interest rate risk.

Prepayments.

The senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility requires
us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:

·

50%
of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement) which will
be reduced to 25% and 0% if we achieve and maintain a total net leverage ratio
of 6.0 to 1.0 and 5.0 to 1.0, respectively;

·

100%
of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other
dispositions of property in excess of $25.0 million in the aggregate and subject
to our right to reinvest the proceeds; and

·

100%
of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from
debt permitted under the senior secured credit agreement.

The
mandatory prepayments discussed above will be applied to the term loan facility
as directed by the senior secured credit agreement. Through January 30, 2009, no
prepayments have been required under the prepayment provisions listed above.

In
addition, the senior secured credit agreement for the asset-based revolving
credit facility requires us to prepay the asset-based revolving credit facility,
subject to certain exceptions, with:


·

100%
of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other
dispositions of revolving facility collateral (as defined below) in excess of
$1.0 million in the aggregate and subject to our right to reinvest the proceeds;
and

·

to
the extent such extensions of credit exceed the then current borrowing base (as
defined in the senior secured credit agreement for the asset-based revolving
credit facility).

We
may be obligated to pay a prepayment premium on the amount repaid under the term
loan facility if the term loans are voluntarily repaid in whole or in part
before July 6, 2009. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the
asset-based revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty,
other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans.

An
event of default under the senior secured credit agreements will occur upon a
change of control as defined in the senior secured credit agreements governing
our Credit Facilities. Upon an event of default, indebtedness under the Credit
Facilities may be accelerated, in which case we will be required to repay all
outstanding loans plus accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facilities.

Amortization.

Beginning September 30, 2009, we are required to repay installments on the
loans under the term loan credit facility in equal quarterly principal amounts
in an aggregate amount per annum equal to 1% of the total funded principal
amount at July 6, 2007, with the balance payable on July 6, 2014. There is no
amortization under the asset-based revolving credit facility. The entire
principal amounts (if any) outstanding under the asset-based revolving credit
facility are due and payable in full at maturity, on July 6, 2013, on which day
the commitments thereunder will terminate.

Guarantee
and Security.

All obligations under the Credit Facilities are
unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future
domestic subsidiaries (excluding certain immaterial subsidiaries and certain
subsidiaries designated by us under our senior secured credit agreements as
“unrestricted subsidiaries”), referred to, collectively, as U.S. Guarantors.

All
obligations and related guarantees under the term loan credit facility are
secured by:

·

a
second-priority security interest in all existing and after-acquired inventory,
accounts receivable, and other assets arising from such inventory and accounts
receivable, of our company and each U.S. Guarantor (the “Revolving Facility
Collateral”), subject to certain exceptions;

·

a
first priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of our
and each U.S. Guarantor’s tangible and intangible assets (other than the
Revolving Facility Collateral); and

·

a
first-priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock held by us, or any of our
domestic subsidiaries that are directly owned by us or one of the U.S.
Guarantors and 65% of


the
voting capital stock of each of our existing and future foreign subsidiaries
that are directly owned by us or one of the U.S. Guarantors.

All
obligations and related guarantees under the asset-based credit facility are
secured by the Revolving Facility Collateral, subject to certain exceptions.

Certain
Covenants and Events of Default.

The senior secured credit agreements
contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to
certain exceptions, our ability to:

·

incur
additional indebtedness;

·

sell
assets;

·

pay
dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;

·

make
investments or acquisitions;

·

repay
or repurchase subordinated indebtedness (including the senior subordinated notes
discussed below) and the senior notes discussed below;

·

amend
material agreements governing our subordinated indebtedness (including the
senior subordinated notes discussed below) or our senior notes discussed
below;

·

and
change our lines of business.

The
senior secured credit agreements also contain certain customary affirmative
covenants and events of default.

At
January 30, 2009, we had no borrowings, $51.0 million of commercial letters of
credit, and $83.7 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our
asset-based revolving credit facility.

Senior Notes due
2015 and Senior Subordinated Toggle Notes due 2017

Overview.

We have $1.175 billion aggregate principal amount of 10.625% senior notes
due 2015 (the “senior notes”) outstanding, which mature on July 15, 2015,
pursuant to an indenture dated as of July 6, 2007 (the “senior indenture”), and
$655.9 million aggregate principal amount of 11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated
toggle notes due 2017 (the “senior subordinated notes”) outstanding, which
mature on July 15, 2017, pursuant to an indenture dated as of July 6, 2007 (the
“senior subordinated indenture”). The senior notes and the senior subordinated
notes are collectively referred to herein as the “notes.” The senior indenture
and the senior subordinated indenture are collectively referred to herein as the
“indentures.” We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption
prices described or set forth in the indentures.

Interest
on the notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Interest on the
senior notes is payable in cash. Cash interest on the senior subordinated notes
accrues at a rate of


11.875%
per annum, and PIK interest (as that term is defined below) accrues at a rate of
12.625% per annum, if applicable. The initial interest payment on the senior
subordinated notes was payable in cash. For any interest period thereafter
through July 15, 2011, we may elect to pay interest on the senior subordinated
notes (i) in cash, (ii) by increasing the principal amount of the senior
subordinated notes or issuing new senior subordinated notes (“PIK interest”) or
(iii) by paying interest on half of the principal amount of the senior
subordinated notes in cash interest and half in PIK interest. After July 15,
2011, all interest on the senior subordinated notes will be payable in cash.
Through January 30, 2009, all such interest has been paid in cash.

The
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the existing and
future direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the
obligations under our Credit Facilities.

We
may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption prices described
or set forth in the indentures. We also may seek, from time to time, to retire
some or all of the notes through cash purchases on the open market, in privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on
prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual
restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. We
repurchased $44.1 million and $25.0 million of the senior subordinated notes in
the fourth quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Change
of Control.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, which is defined in
the indentures, each holder of the notes has the right to require us to
repurchase some or all of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the repurchase date.

Covenants.

The indentures contain covenants limiting, among other things, our ability
and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to (subject to certain
exceptions):

·

incur
additional debt, issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred stock;

·

pay
dividends on or make certain distributions and other restricted payments;

·

create
certain liens or encumbrances;

·

sell
assets;

·

enter
into transactions with affiliates;

·

make
payments to us;

·

consolidate,
merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

·

designate
our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.


Events
of Default.

The indentures also provide for events of default which, if any
of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on
the notes to become or to be declared due and payable.

Adjusted
EBITDA

Under
the agreements governing the Credit Facilities and the indentures, certain
limitations and restrictions could arise if we are not able to satisfy and
remain in compliance with specified financial ratios. Management believes the
most significant of such ratios is the senior secured incurrence test under the
Credit Facilities.  This test measures the ratio of the senior secured debt
to Adjusted EBITDA. This ratio would need to be no greater than 4.25 to 1 to
avoid such limitations and restrictions. As of January 30, 2009, this ratio was
2.1 to 1. Senior secured debt is defined as our total debt secured by liens or
similar encumbrances less cash and cash equivalents.  EBITDA is defined as
income (loss) from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle plus interest and other financing costs, net, provision for
income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as
EBITDA, further adjusted to give effect to adjustments required in calculating
this covenant ratio under our Credit Facilities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are
not presentations made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not measures of
financial performance or condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not
be considered as an alternative to (i) net income, operating income or any
other performance measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or
(ii) operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free
cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain
cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service
requirements and replacements of fixed assets.

Our
presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical
tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis
of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use
identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may
not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We
believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to
provide additional information about the calculation of this financial ratio in
the Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of this ratio.
Specifically, non-compliance with the senior secured indebtedness ratio
contained in our Credit Facilities could prohibit us from making investments,
incurring liens, making certain restricted payments and incurring additional
secured indebtedness (other than the additional funding provided for under the
senior secured credit agreement and pursuant to specified exceptions).


The
calculation of Adjusted EBITDA under the Credit Facilities is as follows:

Interest Rate
Swaps

We
use interest rate swaps to minimize the risk of adverse changes in interest
rates. These swaps are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic
exposure. Because of high correlation between the derivative financial
instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value
of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the
value of the underlying economic exposure. Our principal interest rate exposure
relates to outstanding amounts under our Credit Facilities. At January 30, 2009,
we had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of approximately $1.69
billion. For more information see Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk” below.

Fair Value
Accounting

We
have classified our interest rate swaps, as further discussed in Item 7A.
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” below, in Level 2
(as defined by SFAS 157) of the fair value hierarchy, as the significant inputs
to the overall valuations are based on market-


observable
data or information derived from or corroborated by market-observable data,
including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market-clearing
transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with
reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the selection of
a particular model to value a derivative depends upon the contractual terms of,
and specific risks inherent in, the instrument as well as the availability of
pricing information in the market. We use similar models to value similar
instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual
terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, and
correlations of such inputs.  For our derivatives, all of which trade in
liquid markets, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does
not involve significant management judgment.

To
comply with the provisions of SFAS 157, we incorporate credit valuation
adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the
respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of
our derivatives. The credit valuation adjustments are calculated by determining
the total expected exposure of the derivatives (which incorporates both the
current and potential future exposure) and then applying each counterparty’s
credit spread to the applicable exposure. For derivatives with two-way exposure,
such as interest rate swaps, the counterparty’s credit spread is applied to our
exposure to the counterparty, and our own credit spread is applied to the
counterparty’s exposure to us, and the net credit valuation adjustment is
reflected in our derivative valuations.  The total expected exposure of a
derivative is derived using market-observable inputs, such as yield curves and
volatilities.  The inputs utilized for our own credit spread are based on
implied spreads from our publicly-traded debt.  For counterparties with
publicly available credit information, the credit spreads over LIBOR used in the
calculations represent implied credit default swap spreads obtained from a third
party credit data provider.  In adjusting the fair value of our derivative
contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact
of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings,
thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.  Additionally, we actively monitor
counterparty credit ratings for any significant changes.

As
of January 30, 2009, the net credit valuation adjustments reduced the settlement
values of our derivative liabilities by $8.5 million.  Various factors
impact changes in the credit valuation adjustments over time, including changes
in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts, as well as changes in
market rates and volatilities, which affect the total expected exposure of the
derivative instruments. When appropriate, valuations are also adjusted for
various factors such as liquidity and bid/offer spreads, which factors we deemed
to be immaterial as of January 30, 2009.

Other
Considerations

Our
inventory balance represented approximately 44% of our total assets exclusive of
goodwill and other intangible assets as of January 30, 2009. Our proficiency in
managing our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows
from operations during a given fiscal year. As a result, efficient inventory
management has been and continues to be an area of focus for us.


The
following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and
commercial commitments as of January 30, 2009 (in thousands):

(a)

Represents obligations for interest
payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations, and includes projected
interest on variable rate long-term debt, based upon 2008 year end rates.

(b)

We retain a significant portion of
the risk for our workers’ compensation, employee health insurance, general
liability, property loss and automobile insurance. As these obligations do not
have scheduled maturities, these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based
upon actuarial assumptions. Reserves for workers’ compensation and general
liability which existed as of the Merger date were discounted in order to arrive
at estimated fair value.  All other amounts are reflected on an
undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets.

(c)

Operating lease obligations are
inclusive of amounts included in deferred rent and closed store obligations in
our consolidated balance sheets.

(d)

We entered into a monitoring
agreement, dated July 6, 2007, with affiliates of certain of our Investors
pursuant to which those entities will provide management and advisory services.
 Such agreement has no contractual term and for purposes of this schedule
is presumed to be outstanding for a period of five years.

(e)

Commercial commitments include
information technology license and support agreements, supplies, fixtures,
letters of credit for import merchandise, and other inventory purchase
obligations.

(f)

Purchase obligations include legally
binding agreements for software licenses and support, supplies, fixtures, and
merchandise purchases excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit.

In
2008 and 2007, our South Carolina-based wholly owned captive insurance
subsidiary, Ashley River Insurance Company (“ARIC”), had investments in U.S.
Government securities, obligations of Government Sponsored Enterprises, short-
and long-term corporate obligations, and asset-backed obligations. These
investments were held pursuant to South Carolina regulatory requirements to
maintain certain asset balances in relation to ARIC’s liability and equity
balances which could limit our ability to use these assets for general corporate
purposes. In May 2008, the state of South Carolina made certain changes to these
regulatory requirements, which had the effect of reducing the amounts and types
of investments required, allowing ARIC to liquidate investments (primarily U.S.
Government and corporate debt securities) totaling $48.6 million during 2008.
 At January 30, 2009, the asset balances held pursuant to these regulatory
requirements equaled $20.0 million and were reflected in our consolidated
balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents.


In
August 2005, we incurred significant losses caused by Hurricane Katrina,
primarily inventory and fixed assets in the form of store fixtures and leasehold
improvements. We reached final settlement of our related insurance claim in 2006
and received proceeds totaling $21.0 million due to these losses, including
$13.0 million in 2006 and $8.0 million prior to 2006, and have utilized a
portion of these proceeds to replace lost assets. Insurance proceeds related to
fixed assets are included in cash flows from investing activities, and proceeds
related to inventory losses and business interruption are included in cash flows
from operating activities.

Legal
actions, claims and tax contingencies

. As described in Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in a number of legal actions
and claims, some of which could potentially result in material cash payments.
 Adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely
affect our liquidity.  As discussed in Note 5 we also have certain income
tax-related contingencies as more fully described below under “Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates.” Future negative developments could have a
material adverse effect on our liquidity.

Considerations
regarding distribution center leases

. The Merger and certain of the related
financing transactions may be interpreted as giving rise to certain trigger
events (which may include events of default) under leases for three of our
distribution centers (“DCs”). We do not believe such an interpretation would be
appropriate under the terms of the leases. During the 2007 Successor period, we
concluded that a probable loss existed in connection with the lease
contingencies and accrued SG&A expenses totaling $12.0 million in the
Successor statement of operations for the period ended February 1, 2008. As of
January 30, 2009, $7.0 million of such amount has been paid. We believe that we
have negotiated with the property owners proposed lease terms that would be
implemented if the owners were to refinance or sell the property and that the
resolution of these negotiations is primarily dependent on conditions in the
real estate and financial markets. We believe that any remaining potential loss
on the resolution of these matters would currently be properly categorized as
reasonably possible rather than probable and therefore reversed the remaining
$5.0 million of previously recorded SG&A expenses during the year ended
January 30, 2009. However, the possibility remains that the ultimate resolution
of these matters could require us to make a significant cash investment to
purchase these DCs.

Credit
ratings.

On December 15, 2008 Standard & Poor’s revised our
long-term debt rating outlook to positive from stable and affirmed our long-term
rating of B.  On September 18, 2008 Moody’s affirmed our long-term debt
rating of B3 and changed the outlook to positive from stable.  These
current ratings are considered non-investment grade.  Our current credit
ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could (1) negatively impact
our ability to obtain financings to finance our operations on satisfactory
terms; (2) have the effect of increasing our financing costs; and (3) have the
effect of increasing our insurance premiums and collateral requirements
necessary for our self-insured programs.

Cash flows

Cash
flows from operating activities.

A
significant component of the change in cash flows from operating activities in
2008 compared to the 2007 periods was our strong operating performance due to
greater sales, higher gross margins and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage
of sales, partially offset by significantly higher interest expense, as
described in more


detail
above under “Results of Operations.” In addition, we experienced increased
inventory turns and improved merchandise payment terms in 2008 as compared to
the 2007 periods. Accounts payable balances increased by $140.4 million in 2008
compared to a decline of $41.4 million in the 2007 Successor period and an
increase of $34.8 million in the 2007 Predecessor period partially as a result
of our implementation of initiatives to aggressively manage our payables.
 Also positively affecting cash flows from operations were increases in
accrued expenses and other in 2008, which was primarily attributable to
increases in litigation reserves, incentive bonus accruals, deferred vendor
rebates, and property and sales tax accruals. Other significant components of
the change in cash flows from operating activities in 2008 as compared to 2007
were changes in inventory balances, which increased by 10% in 2008 compared to
decreases of approximately 6% and 1% during the 2007 Successor and Predecessor
periods, respectively. Inventory levels in the highly consumable category
increased by $77.8 million, or 12%, in 2008 compared to a decline of $90.7
million, or 12%, in the 2007 Successor period and an increase of $48.8 million,
or 7%, in the 2007 Predecessor period. The seasonal category increased by $20.9
million, or 8%, in 2008 compared to a decline of $24.2 million, or 8%, in the
2007 Successor period and a decline of $38.7 million, or 11%, in the 2007
Predecessor period. The home products category declined by $2.6 million, or 2%,
in 2008 compared to an increase of $25.4 million, or 19%, in the 2007 Successor
period and a decline of $15.0 million, or 10%, in the 2007 Predecessor period.
The basic clothing category increased by $30.2 million, or 15%, in 2008 compared
to an increase of $10.0 million, or 5%, in the 2007 Successor period and a
decline of $11.5 million, or 5%, in the 2007 Predecessor period. In addition,
net income in 2008 compared to the net losses in the 2007 periods discussed
above was a principal factor in the increase in income taxes paid in 2008.
Income tax refunds received in 2007 for taxes paid in prior years that did not
reoccur in 2008 also contributed to the increase in income taxes paid during
2008.

Cash
flows from operating activities for the 2007 periods were impacted by a net loss
of $4.8 million and $8.0 million in the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods,
respectively, compared to net income of $137.9 million in 2006, as described in
detail under “Results of Operations” above, including the incurrence of $101.4
million of Transaction and related costs in the 2007 Predecessor period. Other
significant components of the change in cash flows from operating activities in
2007 as compared to 2006 were changes in inventory balances, which decreased by
approximately 6% and 1% during the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods,
respectively, compared to a decrease of approximately 3% during 2006. As
compared to changes in inventory levels in the 2007 periods discussed above, in
2006 highly consumable increased $63.2 million, or 10%; seasonal increased $6.7
million, or 2%; home products decreased $52.5 million, or 25%; and basic
clothing decreased $59.5 million, or 21%. In addition to inventory changes, the
net losses in the 2007 periods discussed above were principal factors in the
reduction in income taxes paid in those periods as compared to 2006. Also
offsetting the decline in net income were changes in accrued expenses,
particularly in the 2007 Predecessor period as compared to 2006, which was
primarily attributable to income tax related reserves, accruals for lease
liabilities on closed stores and property and sales tax accruals.

Cash
flows from investing activities

. Cash flows used in investing activities
totaling $152.6 million in 2008 were primarily related to capital expenditures
and sales of investments. Significant components of our property and equipment
purchases in 2008 included the following


approximate
amounts: $149 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of
existing stores; $22 million for new stores; $17 million for distribution and
transportation-related capital expenditures; and $13 million for information
systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2008 we opened 207 new
stores and remodeled or relocated 404 stores.

Purchases
and sales of short-term investments, which equaled net sales of $51.6 million in
2008, primarily reflect our investment activities in our captive insurance
subsidiary, including a change in regulatory requirements as discussed in more
detail above under “Other Considerations.”

The
Merger, as discussed in more detail above, required cash payments in the 2007
Successor period of approximately $6.7 billion, net of cash acquired of $350
million. Significant components of property and equipment purchases in the 2007
Successor period included the following approximate amounts: $45 million for
improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $23 million
for distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures; and $16
million for new stores. During the 2007 Successor period, we opened 170 new
stores and remodeled or relocated 235 stores. Significant components of property
and equipment purchases in the 2007 Predecessor period included the following
approximate amounts: $29 million for new stores; $15 million for improvements,
upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; and $7 million for
distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures. During the 2007
Predecessor period, we opened 195 new stores and remodeled or relocated 65
stores.

During
the 2007 Successor period we purchased a secured promissory note for $37.0
million which represents debt issued by a third-party entity from which we lease
our distribution center in Ardmore, Oklahoma. Purchases and sales of short-term
investments, which equaled net sales of $17.6 million and $4.4 million in the
respective 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods, primarily reflect our
investment activities in our captive insurance subsidiary, and all purchases of
long-term investments were related to the captive insurance subsidiary.

Cash
flows used in investing activities totaling $282.0 million in 2006 were
primarily related to capital expenditures and, to a lesser degree, purchases of
long-term investments. Significant components of our property and equipment
purchases in 2006 included the following approximate amounts: $66 million for
distribution and transportation-related capital expenditures (including
approximately $30 million related to our distribution center in Marion, Indiana
which opened in 2006); $66 million for new stores; $50 million for a capital
project designed to improve inventory flow from our DCs to consumers; and $38
million for capital projects in existing stores. During 2006 we opened 537 new
stores and remodeled or relocated 64 stores.

Purchases
and sales of short-term investments in 2006, which equaled net sales of $1.9
million, reflect our investment activities in tax-exempt auction rate securities
as well as investing activities of our captive insurance subsidiary. Purchases
of long-term investments are related to the captive insurance subsidiary.

Capital
expenditures during 2009 are projected to be in the range of $250-275 million.
We anticipate funding 2009 capital requirements with cash flows from operations
and our revolving credit facility, if necessary. Significant components of the
2009 capital plan include


growth
initiatives including leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment for
approximately 450 new stores; continued investment in our existing store base
with plans for remodeling and relocating approximately 400 stores; and
additional investments in our supply chain and information technology. We plan
to undertake these expenditures in order to improve our infrastructure and
increase our cash generated from operating activities.

Cash
flows from financing activities

.  In 2008, we repaid borrowings of
$102.5 million under our revolving credit facility and as of January 30, 2009,
we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Also during 2008, we
repurchased $44.1 million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes.

In
the 2007 Successor period, to finance the Merger, we issued long-term debt of
approximately $4.2 billion and issued common stock in the amount of
approximately $2.8 billion (primarily relating to the cash equity contributions
from the Investors); we incurred costs associated with the issuance of
Merger-related long-term debt of $87.4 million; we completed a cash tender offer
for our 2010 Notes as discussed above, resulting in the valid tender of
approximately 99% of the 2010 Notes resulting in repayments of long-term debt
and related consent fees in the amount of $215.6 million; and incurred
borrowings, net of repayments, under our new asset-based revolving credit
facility of $102.5 million.

Cash
flows used in financing activities during 2006 included the repurchase of
approximately 4.5 million shares of the Predecessor’s common stock at a total
cost of $79.9 million, cash dividends paid of $62.5 million, or $0.20 per share,
on the Predecessor’s outstanding common stock, and $14.1 million to reduce our
outstanding capital lease and financing obligations. These uses of cash were
partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options during 2006 of
$19.9 million.

The
borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit agreements in 2008, the
2007 Successor period and 2006 were primarily a result of activity associated
with periodic cash needs.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and
related disclosures.  In addition to the estimates presented below, there
are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are
not deemed critical as defined below. We believe these estimates are reasonable
and appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and
other considerations used, the resulting changes could have a material effect on
the financial statements taken as a whole.

Management
believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve
significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates. Management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit
Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the
disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates.


Merchandise
Inventories

. Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market with cost determined using the retail last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method.
Under our retail inventory method (“RIM”), the calculation of gross profit and
the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a
calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a
department level. The RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in
the retail industry due to its practicality. Also, it is recognized that the use
of the RIM will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market
(“LCM”) if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of
inventories.

Inherent
in the RIM calculation are certain significant management judgments and
estimates including, among others, initial markups, markdowns, and shrinkage,
which significantly impact the gross profit calculation as well as the ending
inventory valuation at cost. These significant estimates, coupled with the fact
that the RIM is an averaging process, can, under certain circumstances, produce
distorted cost figures. Factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation
of the inventory balance include:

·

applying
the RIM to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost
and selling price relationship and turnover;

·

applying
the RIM to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of
gross profit, such as those relating to seasonal merchandise;

·

inaccurate
estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory
at a store and the financial statement date; and

·

inaccurate
estimates of LCM and/or LIFO reserves.

Factors
that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in
estimating the shrink provision (see discussion below) and recent improvements
in the annual LIFO analysis whereby all SKUs are considered in the index
formulation. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made
only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that
time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimates
of expected year-end inventory levels, sales for the year and the expected rate
of inflation/deflation for the year and are thus subject to adjustment in the
final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. We also perform interim inventory-aging
analysis for determining obsolete inventory. Our policy is to write down
inventory to an LCM value based on various management assumptions including
estimated markdowns and sales required to liquidate such aged inventory in
future periods. Inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as
appropriate to reflect write-downs determined to be necessary.

Factors
such as slower inventory turnover due to changes in competitors’ tactics,
consumer preferences, consumer spending and unseasonable weather patterns, among
other factors, could cause excess inventory requiring greater than estimated
markdowns to entice consumer purchases, resulting in an unfavorable impact on
our consolidated financial statements. Sales shortfalls due to the above factors
could cause reduced purchases from vendors and


associated
vendor allowances that would also result in an unfavorable impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

We
calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during
the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a
physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual
is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store, at a department
level, and is determined by dividing the book-to-physical inventory adjustments
recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same
period for each store. To the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield
different results than this estimated accrual, our effective shrink rate for a
given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated
results to the actual results. Although we perform physical inventories in
virtually all of our stores on an annual basis, the same stores do not
necessarily get counted in the same reporting periods from year to year, which
could impact comparability in a given reporting period.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.

We amortize intangible assets over their
estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. If impairment
indicators are noted, amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment
based on projected undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to
fair value based on either discounted projected cash flows or appraised values.
Future cash flow projections are based on management’s projections. Significant
judgments required in this testing process may include projecting future cash
flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Projections
are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance,
market trends, strategic plans and other available information. Changes in these
estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair
value or impairment. Future indicators of impairment could result in an asset
impairment charge.

Under
SFAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we are required to test
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or
more frequently if impairment indicators occur. The goodwill impairment test is
a two-step process that requires management to make judgments in determining
what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process
consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting unit based on valuation
techniques (including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit
forecasts) and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying
value, which includes goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the
carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the
impairment by determining an “implied fair value” of goodwill. The determination
of the “implied fair value” of goodwill would require us to allocate the
estimated fair value of our reporting unit to its assets and liabilities. Any
unallocated fair value represents the “implied fair value” of goodwill, which
would be compared to its corresponding carrying value.

We
performed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets during the third quarter of 2008 based on conditions as of the
end of our second quarter, and subsequently reviewed such results as of the end
of 2008. These analyses indicated that no impairment was necessary. We are not
currently projecting a decline in cash flows that could be expected to have an
adverse effect such as a violation of debt covenants or future impairment
charges.


Purchase
Accounting.

The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in
accordance with the purchase accounting provisions of SFAS 141, “Business
Combinations,” under which our assets and liabilities have been accounted for at
their estimated fair values as of the date of the Merger. The aggregate purchase
price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, based upon an assessment of their relative fair values as
of the date of the Merger. These estimates of fair values, the allocation of the
purchase price and other factors related to the accounting for the Merger are
subject to significant judgments and the use of estimates.

Property
and Equipment

. Property and equipment are recorded at cost. We group our
assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provide for
depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated average useful life of
each asset class, except for leasehold improvements, which are amortized over
the lesser of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the
asset. Certain store and warehouse fixtures, when fully depreciated, are removed
from the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts.
The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful
depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates.

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets.

We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets
for impairment at least annually, and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. In accordance with SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we review for impairment stores open for
approximately two years or more for which recent cash flows from operations are
negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease. Our
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon
historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability
which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult
to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized
for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the
asset’s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon
future cash flows (discounted at our credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other
reasonable estimates of fair market value in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

We
recorded impairment charges included in SG&A expense of approximately $4.0
million in 2008, $0.2 million in the 2007 Predecessor period and $9.4 million in
2006 to reduce the carrying value of certain of our stores’ assets as deemed
necessary based on our evaluation that such amounts would not be recoverable,
primarily due to insufficient sales or excessive costs resulting in negative
current and projected future cash flows at these locations. Such assets, to the
extent still functional, are held for use in other store locations. The majority
of the 2006 charges were recorded pursuant to certain strategic initiatives
discussed above.

Insurance
Liabilities

. We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’
compensation, employee health insurance, general liability, property loss and
automobile coverage. These costs are significant primarily due to the large
employee base and number of stores. At the date of the Merger the liability for
workers’ compensation and general liability was discounted in accordance with
purchase accounting standards. Subsequent to the Merger,


provisions
are made to these insurance liabilities on an undiscounted basis based on actual
claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using
actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends. If future claim trends
deviate from recent historical patterns, we may be required to record additional
expenses or expense reductions, which could be material to our future financial
results.

Contingent
Liabilities – Income Taxes.

Income tax reserves are determined using the
methodology established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An
Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (“FIN 48”).  FIN 48, which we adopted
on February 3, 2007, requires companies to assess each income tax position taken
using a two step process.  A determination is first made as to whether it
is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the
technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities.  If the tax
position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit
recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position.
Uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be
made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or
varying interpretation.  If our determinations and estimates prove to be
inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial
results.

Contingent
Liabilities - Legal Matters

.

We are subject to legal, regulatory and
other proceedings and claims. We establish liabilities as appropriate for these
claims and proceedings based upon the probability and estimability of losses and
to fairly present, in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in our
financial statements and SEC filings, management’s view of our exposure. We
review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess
probability and estimates of loss. We re-evaluate these assessments on a
quarterly basis or as new and significant information becomes available to
determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability
should be adjusted. The actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding
ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded
liability. In addition, because it is not permissible under U.S. GAAP to
establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable,
in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to
the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial, for
example, or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement). See Note 8 to the
consolidated financial statements.

Lease
Accounting and Excess Facilities

. The majority of our stores are subject to
short-term leases (usually with initial or current terms of 3 to 5 years) with
multiple renewal options when available. We also have stores subject to
build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which typically carry a primary lease
term of 10 years with multiple renewal options. Approximately 42% of our stores
have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales
volume. We recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified
sales targets is considered probable. We recognize rent expense over the term of
the lease. We record minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the
base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that we take physical
possession of the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period
prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install
store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the
minimum rent, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and
record


the
difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under
the lease as deferred rent. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, are
recorded as deferred incentive rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense
over the term of the lease. We reflect as a liability any difference between the
calculated expense and the amounts actually paid. Improvements of leased
properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease
term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

For
store closures (excluding those associated with a business combination) where a
lease obligation still exists, we record the estimated future liability
associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in
accordance with SFAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” Based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected
trends, management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming
stores. Liabilities are established at the point of closure for the present
value of any remaining operating lease obligations, net of estimated sublease
income, and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs, as
prescribed by SFAS 146. Key assumptions in calculating the liability include the
timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements, estimates related to the
sublease potential of closed locations, and estimation of other related exit
costs. If actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of
sublease income differ from our estimates, the resulting liabilities could vary
from recorded amounts. These liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted
when necessary.

Share-Based
Payments

. Our share-based stock option awards are valued on an individual
grant basis using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed form option pricing model. The
application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and
highly sensitive in the valuation of stock options, which affects compensation
expense related to these options. These assumptions include an estimate of the
fair value of our common stock (as our stock is not publicly traded), the term
that the options are expected to be outstanding, an estimate of the volatility
of our stock price (which is based on a peer group of publicly traded
companies), applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock. Other
factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of share-based payments
include estimated forfeiture rates of share-based awards. If our estimates
differ materially from actual experience, we may be required to record
additional expense or reductions of expense, which could be material to our
future financial results.

Fair
Value Measurements.

We measure fair value of financial assets and
liabilities in accordance with SFAS 157, which requires that fair values be
determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability.  SFAS 157 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on
market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity
(observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy)
and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
(unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Therefore,
Level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is
little, if any, related market activity, and thus requires the use of
significant judgment and estimates.

Our
fair value measurements are primarily associated with our derivative financial
instruments and to a lesser degree our mutual fund holdings. The values of our
derivative


financial
instruments are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including
discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the
period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest
rate curves.  The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using
the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash
payments (or receipts) and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or
payments).  The variable cash receipts (or payments) are based on an
expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable
market interest rate curves.

Derivative
Financial Instruments.

We account for derivative instruments in accordance
with SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”,
as amended and interpreted.  SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for
hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires that every derivative instrument be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value, and that changes in the derivative’s fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
 See “Fair Value Measurements” above for a discussion of derivative
valuations.  Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative’s
gains and losses to either offset related results on the hedged item in the
statement of operations or be accumulated in other comprehensive income, and
requires that a company formally document, designate, and assess the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. We use derivative
instruments to manage our exposure to changing interest rates, primarily with
interest rate swaps.

In
addition to making valuation estimates, we also bear the risk that certain
derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges and currently meet
the strict hedge accounting requirements of SFAS 133 may not qualify in the
future as “highly effective,” as defined, as well as the risk that hedged
transactions in cash flow hedging relationships may no longer be considered
probable to occur. Further, new interpretations and guidance related to SFAS No.
133 may be issued in the future, and we cannot predict the possible impact that
such guidance may have on our use of derivative instruments going forward.

Adoption of
Accounting Standards

In
May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” SFAS 162
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of
nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (the GAAP hierarchy).
SFAS 162 became effective in November 2008. The adoption of this standard did
not have a material impact on our financial statements.

On
February 2, 2008, we adopted components of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements”. We have not adopted SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and
liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS
157 applies to reported balances that are required or


permitted
to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements.
Accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of
reported balances.

We
adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective February 3, 2007. The adoption
resulted in an $8.9 million decrease in retained earnings and a reclassification
of certain amounts between deferred income taxes and other noncurrent
liabilities to conform to the balance sheet presentation requirements of FIN 48.
As of the date of adoption, the total reserve for uncertain tax benefits was
$77.9 million.  This reserve excludes the federal income tax benefit for
the uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes which is now included
in deferred tax assets. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the reserve for
interest expense related to income taxes was increased to $15.3 million and a
reserve for potential penalties of $1.9 million related to uncertain income tax
positions was recorded. As of the date of adoption, approximately $27.1 million
of the reserve for uncertain tax positions would have impacted our effective
income tax rate subsequently if we were to recognize the tax benefit for these
positions.

Subsequent
to the adoption of FIN 48, we elected to record income tax related interest and
penalties as a component of the provision for income tax expense.

Accounting
Pronouncements

In
March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, an
amendment of FASB Statement 133. SFAS 161 applies to all derivative instruments
and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging
instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42 of SFAS 133 and related hedged
items accounted for under SFAS 133. SFAS 161 requires entities to provide
greater transparency through additional disclosures about how and why an entity
uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and how
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective as of the
beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2008.
 We plan to adopt SFAS 161 during the first quarter of our 2009 fiscal year
and its impact is expected to be limited to the additional disclosures discussed
above.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”. The new
standard establishes the requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and
measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest (formerly minority
interest) in an acquiree; provides updated requirements for recognition and
measurement of goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
bargain purchase; and provides updated disclosure requirements to enable users
of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early
adoption is not allowed.  Unless a qualifying transaction is consummated
subsequent to the effective date, the adoption of this standard on our financial
statements is expected to be limited to any future Merger-related adjustments to
uncertain tax positions that would, if subsequently recognized, impact our
results of operations rather than goodwill.


In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS 157
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The
standard also requires expanded information about the extent to which companies
measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure
fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For
non-financial assets and liabilities, the effective date has been delayed to
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We currently expect to adopt the
components of SFAS 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities during
2009. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this standard
on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM
7A.

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Risk
Management

We
are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates, and
to a lesser degree commodity prices. To minimize this risk, we may periodically
use financial instruments, including derivatives. As a matter of policy, we do
not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and
all derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed
pursuant to approval by the Board of Directors. All financial instrument
positions taken by us are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an
underlying economic exposure. Because of high correlation between the derivative
financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged, fluctuations in
the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal
changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

We
manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable
interest rate debt and, from time to time, derivative financial instruments. Our
principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our Credit
Facilities. Our Credit Facilities provide for variable rate borrowings of up to
$3.425 billion including availability of $1.125 billion under our
senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, subject to the borrowing
base.  In order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest
exposure under the Credit Facilities, we entered into interest rate swaps which
became effective on July 31, 2007. Pursuant to the swaps, we swapped three
month LIBOR rates for fixed interest rates, resulting in the payment of an
all-in fixed rate of 7.68% on an original notional amount of $2.0 billion
originally scheduled to amortize on a quarterly basis until maturity at
July 31, 2012.

On
October 3, 2008, a counterparty to one of our 2007 swap agreements declared
bankruptcy, which constituted a technical default under this contract and on
October 30, 2008, we terminated this swap agreement. We subsequently cash
settled the swap on November 10, 2008 for approximately $7.6 million, including
interest accrued to the date of termination. As of January 30, 2009, the
notional amount under the remaining 2007 swaps is $866.7 million.


Effective
February 28, 2008, we entered into a $350.0 million step-down interest rate swap
in order to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest
exposure under the Credit Facilities. Under the terms of this agreement we
swapped one month LIBOR rates for fixed interest rates, which will result in the
payment of a fixed rate of 5.58% on a notional amount of $350.0 million for the
first year and $150.0 million for the second year.

Effective
December 31, 2008, we entered into a $475.0 million interest rate swap in order
to mitigate an additional portion of the variable rate interest exposure under
the Credit Facilities. This swap is scheduled to mature on January 31,
2013. Under the terms of this agreement we swapped one month LIBOR rates for
fixed interest rates, which will result in the payment of a fixed rate of 5.06%
on a notional amount of $475.0 million through April 2010, $400.0 million from
May 2010 to October 2011, and $300.0 million to maturity.

A
change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax earnings and
cash flows; whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the
economic fair value of debt but not our pre-tax earnings and cash flows.
 Our interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges.
 Therefore, changes in market fluctuations related to the effective portion
of these cash flow hedges do not impact our pre-tax earnings until the accrued
interest is recognized on the derivatives and the associated hedged debt.
 Based on our outstanding debt as of January 30, 2009 and assuming that our
mix of debt instruments, derivative instruments and other variables remain the
same, the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in variable
interest rates would have a pretax impact on our earnings and cash flows of
approximately $6.2 million.

The
interest rate swaps are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended and
interpreted (collectively, “SFAS 133”).  SFAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging
activities. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either
assets or liabilities at fair value.

The
conditions and uncertainties in the global credit markets have substantially
increased the credit risk of other counterparties to our swap agreements.
 In the event such counterparties fail to perform under our swap agreements
and we are unable to enter into new swap agreements on terms favorable to us,
our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk may be materially
impaired. We attempt to manage counterparty credit risk by periodically
evaluating the financial position and creditworthiness of such counterparties,
monitoring the amount for which we are at risk with each counterparty, and where
possible, dispersing the risk among multiple counterparties. There can be no
assurance that we will manage or mitigate our counterparty credit risk
effectively.


ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Dollar
General Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar General
Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 30, 2009 (Successor) and February 1,
2008 (Successor), and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended January 30, 2009
(Successor), the periods from March 6, 2007 to February 1, 2008 (Successor) and
from February 3, 2007 to July 6, 2007 (Predecessor), and the year ended February
2, 2007 (Predecessor). These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we
express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Dollar General
Corporation and subsidiaries at January 30, 2009 (Successor) and February 1,
2008 (Successor), and the consolidated results of their operations and their
cash flows for the year ended January 30, 2009 (Successor), the periods from
March 6, 2007 to February 1, 2008 (Successor) and from February 3, 2007 to July
6, 2007 (Predecessor), and the year ended February 2, 2007 (Predecessor), in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
February 3, 2007, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax
positions in connection with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”.

Basis
of presentation and accounting policies

Basis of
presentation

These
notes contain references to the years 2008 and 2006, which represent fiscal
years ended January 30, 2009 and February 2, 2007, respectively, each of which
were 52-week accounting periods. The Company completed a merger transaction on
July 6, 2007 and therefore the 2007 presentation includes separate presentation
of the periods before and after the merger. The Company’s fiscal year ends on
the Friday closest to January 31. The consolidated financial statements include
all subsidiaries of the Company, except for its not-for-profit subsidiary which
the Company does not control.  Intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.

Dollar
General Corporation (the “Company”) was acquired on July 6, 2007 through a
Merger (as defined and discussed in greater detail in Note 2 below) accounted
for as a reverse acquisition.  Although the Company continued as the same
legal entity after the Merger, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are presented for the “Predecessor” and “Successor” relating to the
periods preceding and succeeding the Merger, respectively.  As a result of
the Company applying purchase accounting and a new basis of accounting beginning
on July 7, 2007, the financial reporting periods presented are as follows:

·

The
2008 presentation reflects the Successor.

·

The
2007 periods presented include the Predecessor period of the Company, reflecting
22 weeks of operating results from February 3, 2007 to July 6, 2007 and 30 weeks
of operating results for the Successor period, reflecting the Merger of the
Company and Buck Acquisition Corp. (“Buck”) from July 7, 2007 to February 1,
2008.

·

Buck’s
results of operations for the period from March 6, 2007 to July 6, 2007 (prior
to the Merger on July 6, 2007) are also included in the consolidated financial
statements for the Successor period described above as a result of certain
derivative financial instruments entered into by Buck prior to the Merger, as
further described below.  Other than these financial instruments, Buck had
no assets, liabilities, or operations prior to the Merger.

·

The
2006 presentation reflects the Predecessor.

The
consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor periods have been prepared
using the Company’s historical basis of accounting.  As a result of
purchase accounting, the pre-Merger and post-Merger consolidated financial
statements are not comparable.

The
Company leases three of its distribution centers (“DCs”) from lessors, which
meet the definition of a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) as described by
Financial Accounting


Standards
Board (“FASB”) Interpretation 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46”), as revised. One of these DCs has been recorded as a financing
obligation whereby the property and equipment are reflected in the consolidated
balance sheets.  The land and buildings of the other two DCs have been
recorded as operating leases in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) 13, “Accounting for Leases.”  The
Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and, accordingly, has not
included these entities in its consolidated financial statements.

Business
description

The
Company sells general merchandise on a retail basis through 8,362 stores (as of
January 30, 2009) in 35 states covering most of the southern, southwestern,
midwestern and eastern United States.  The Company has DCs in Scottsville,
Kentucky; Ardmore, Oklahoma; South Boston, Virginia; Indianola, Mississippi;
Fulton, Missouri; Alachua, Florida; Zanesville, Ohio; Jonesville, South Carolina
and Marion, Indiana.

The
Company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers.
Approximately 10% of the Company’s purchases in 2008 were made from The Procter
& Gamble Company. The Company’s next largest supplier accounted for
approximately 6% of the Company’s purchases in 2008.

Cash and cash
equivalents

Cash
and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with insignificant
interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less when
purchased.  Such investments primarily consist of money market funds,
certificates of deposit (which may include foreign time deposits), and
commercial paper.  The carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable
estimate of their fair value due to the short maturity of these investments. The
Company held foreign time deposits of $0 and $5.2 million as of January 30, 2009
and February 1, 2008, respectively.

Payments
due from banks for third-party credit card, debit card and electronic benefit
transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $16.2
million and $13.9 million at January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008,
respectively.

The
Company’s cash management system provides for daily investment of available
balances and the funding of outstanding checks when presented for payment.
 Outstanding but unpresented checks totaling approximately $127.6 million
and $107.9 million at January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, respectively, have
been included in Accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets.  Upon
presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available cash
balances or the Company’s credit facilities.

The
Company has certain cash and cash equivalents balances that are being held in
accordance with certain insurance-related regulatory requirements which could
limit the Company’s ability to use these assets for general corporate purposes,
as further described below under “Investments in debt and equity securities.”


Investments
in debt and equity securities

The
Company accounts for its investment in debt and marketable equity securities in
accordance with SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities,” and accordingly, classifies them as held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading.  Debt securities categorized as
held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost.  Debt and equity securities
categorized as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with any unrealized
gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of
Accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Trading securities (primarily mutual
funds held pursuant to deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans,
as further discussed in Note 9) are stated at fair value, with changes in fair
value recorded in income as a component of Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expense.

In
general, the Company invests excess cash in shorter-dated, highly liquid
investments such as money market funds, certificates of deposit, and commercial
paper.  Such securities have been classified either as held-to-maturity or
available-for-sale, depending on the type of securities purchased (debt versus
equity) as well as the Company’s intentions with respect to the potential sale
of such securities before their stated maturity dates.  Given the short
maturities of such investments (except for those securities described in further
detail below), the carrying amounts approximate the fair values of such
securities.

In
years prior to 2007, the Company invested in tax-exempt auction rate securities,
which are debt instruments having longer-dated (in some cases, many years) legal
maturities, but with interest rates that are generally reset every 28-35 days
under an auction system.  There were no such investments outstanding as of
January 30, 2009 or February 1, 2008.

In
2008 and 2007, the Company’s South Carolina-based wholly owned captive insurance
subsidiary, Ashley River Insurance Company (“ARIC”), had investments in U.S.
Government securities, obligations of Government Sponsored Enterprises, short-
and long-term corporate obligations, and asset-backed obligations. These
investments were held pursuant to South Carolina regulatory requirements to
maintain certain asset balances in relation to ARIC’s liability and equity
balances which could limit the Company’s ability to use these assets for general
corporate purposes. In May 2008, the state of South Carolina made certain
changes to these regulatory requirements, which had the effect of reducing the
amounts and types of investments required to be held. As a result of these
changes, the Company reclassified certain investments held by ARIC from
held-to-maturity to available-for-sale, and ARIC subsequently liquidated
investments (primarily U.S. Government and corporate debt securities) totaling
$48.6 million during 2008. At January 30, 2009, the asset balances held pursuant
to these regulatory requirements equaled $20.0 million and were reflected in the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents.

Historical
cost information pertaining to investments in mutual funds by participants in
the Company’s supplemental retirement and compensation deferral plans classified
as trading securities is not readily available to the Company.


On
January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and
trading securities consisted of the following (in thousands):

On
January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, these investments were included in the
following accounts in the consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):


The
contractual maturities of held-to-maturity securities as of January 30, 2009
were in excess of three years and were $31.4 million at cost and $28.9 million
at fair value, respectively.

For
the Successor year ended January 30, 2009 and period ended February 1, 2008, and
the Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007 and year ended February 2, 2007, gross
realized gains and losses on the sales of available-for-sale securities were not
material.  The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific
identification method.

Merchandise
inventories

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail
last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. Under the Company’s retail inventory method
(“RIM”), the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of
inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail
inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level.  Costs
directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized into
inventory. The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was approximately $50.0
million at January 30, 2009 and $6.1 million at February 1, 2008. Current cost
is determined using the retail first-in, first-out method.  The Company’s
LIFO reserves were adjusted to zero at July 6, 2007 as a result of the Merger.
The Successor recorded LIFO provisions of $43.9 million and $6.1 million during
2008 and 2007, respectively. The Predecessor recorded a LIFO credit of $1.5
million in 2006.

In
2008, the increased commodity cost pressures mainly related to food and pet
products which have been driven by fruit and vegetable prices and rising freight
costs.  Increases in petroleum, resin, metals, pulp and other raw material
commodity driven costs also resulted in multiple product cost increases. The
Company intends to address these commodity cost increases through negotiations
with its vendors and by increasing retail prices as necessary.  On a
quarterly basis, the Company estimates the annual impact of commodity cost
fluctuations based upon the best available information at that point in time.

Store pre-opening
costs

Pre-opening
costs related to new store openings and the construction periods are expensed as
incurred.

Property and
equipment

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost.  The Company provides for depreciation
and amortization on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful
lives:

Land
improvements


Buildings

39-40

Furniture,
fixtures and equipment

3-10

Improvements
of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the
applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.


Impairment
of long-lived assets

When
indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value
of long-lived assets, other than goodwill, in relation to the operating
performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying
assets. In accordance with SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets,” the Company reviews for impairment stores open more than
two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment
results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future
cash flows over the life of the lease. The Company’s estimate of undiscounted
future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the
stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many
factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a
long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment
is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated
fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon estimated future
cash flows (discounted at the Company’s credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other
reasonable estimates of fair market value. Assets to be disposed of are adjusted
to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value.

The
Company recorded impairment charges included in SG&A expense of
approximately $4.0 million in 2008, $0.2 million in the 2007 Predecessor period
and $9.4 million in 2006 to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores’
assets as deemed necessary based on the Company’s evaluation that such amounts
would not be recoverable primarily due to insufficient sales or excessive costs
resulting in negative current and projected future cash flows at these
locations. The majority of the 2006 charges were recorded pursuant to certain
strategic initiatives discussed in Note 3.

Goodwill and other
intangible assets

The
Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless
such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for
impairment when indicators of impairment are present, based on undiscounted cash
flows, and if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted
cash flows or appraised values.

Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually
or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present and written down to
fair value as required. No impairment of intangible assets has been identified
during any of the periods presented.

The
goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that requires management to make
judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first
step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of the Company’s
reporting unit based on valuation techniques (including a discounted cash flow
model using revenue and profit forecasts) and comparing that estimated fair
value with the recorded carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the
estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed
to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an “implied fair value”
of goodwill. The determination of the “implied fair value” of goodwill would
require the Company to allocate the estimated fair value of its reporting unit
to its assets and liabilities. Any unallocated fair value would represent


the
“implied fair value” of goodwill, which would be compared to its corresponding
carrying value.

Other
assets

Other
assets consist primarily of long-term investments, qualifying prepaid expenses,
debt issuance costs which are amortized over the life of the related
obligations, and utility and security deposits. Such debt issuance costs
increased substantially subsequent to the Merger as further discussed in Notes 2
and 6.

Vendor
rebates

The
Company accounts for all cash consideration received from vendors in accordance
with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (“EITF”) 02-16,
“Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor.” Cash consideration received from a vendor is generally
presumed to be a rebate or an allowance and is accounted for as a reduction of
merchandise purchase costs and classified as a current or long term liability,
as applicable, until recognition in the statement of operations at the time the
goods are sold. However, certain specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying
SG&A expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products may be
offset by cash consideration received from vendors, in accordance with
arrangements such as cooperative advertising, when earned for dollar amounts up
to but not exceeding actual incremental costs. The Company recognizes amounts
received for cooperative advertising on performance, “first showing” or
distribution, consistent with its policy for advertising expense in accordance
with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position 93-7, “Reporting on Advertising Costs.”

Rent
expense

Rent
expense is recognized over the term of the lease.  The Company records
minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable
lease term commencing on the date that the Company takes physical possession of
the property from the landlord, which normally includes a period prior to the
store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store
fixtures.  When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the
minimum rent, the Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line
basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the
amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent.  Tenant allowances, to
the extent received, are recorded as deferred incentive rent and are amortized
as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease.  Any difference
between the calculated expense and the amounts actually paid are reflected as a
liability,

with the current portion
in Accrued expenses and other and the long-term portion in Other liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets, and totaled approximately $7.7 million and $3.7
million at January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, respectively.

The
Company recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified
sales targets are considered probable, in accordance with EITF Issue 98-9,
“Accounting for Contingent Rent.” The amount expensed but not paid as of January
30, 2009 and February 1,


was approximately $10.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively, and is included
in Accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets (See Note
8).

In
the normal course of business, based on an overall analysis of store performance
and expected trends, management periodically evaluates the need to close
underperforming stores. Generally, for store closures where a lease obligation
still exists, the Company records the estimated future liability associated with
the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with SFAS
146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The
estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation for certain
store closures associated with the Merger were based on EITF 95-3, “Recognition
of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” Key
assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to
terminate lease agreements, estimates related to the sublease potential of
closed locations, and estimation of other related exit costs. Liabilities are
reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary.  The current portion of
the closed store rent liability is reflected in Accrued expenses and other and
the long-term portion in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets,
and totaled approximately $13.2 million at January 30, 2009 and $20.2 million at
February 1, 2008.

Accrued expenses
and other liabilities

Accrued
expenses and other consist of the following:

Other
accrued expenses primarily include the current portion of liabilities for legal
settlements, freight expense, contingent rent expense, interest, electricity,
lease contract termination liabilities for closed stores, common area and other
maintenance charges, store insurance liabilities and income tax related
reserves.

Insurance
liabilities

The
Company retains a significant portion of risk for its workers’ compensation,
employee health, general liability, property and automobile claim exposures.
 Accordingly, provisions are made for the Company’s estimates of such
risks.  The undiscounted future claim costs for the workers’ compensation,
general liability, and health claim risks are derived using actuarial methods.
 To the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from those estimates,
future results of operations will be affected. Ashley River Insurance Company
(or ARIC, as defined above), a South Carolina-based wholly owned captive
insurance subsidiary of the Company, charges the operating subsidiary companies
premiums to insure the retained workers’ compensation and non-property general
liability exposures.  Pursuant to South Carolina insurance regulations,
ARIC has cash and cash equivalents balances that may be limited for


general
corporate purposes, as further described above under “Investments in debt and
equity securities.” ARIC currently insures no unrelated third-party risk.

As
a result of the Merger, the Company recorded its assumed self-insurance reserves
as of the Merger date at their present value in accordance with SFAS 141,
“Business Combinations”, using a discount rate of 5.4%. The balance of the
resulting discount was $11.7 million and $18.7 million at January 30, 2009 and
February 1, 2008, respectively. Other than for reserves assumed in a business
combination, the Company’s policy is to record self-insurance reserves on an
undiscounted basis.

Other
liabilities

Other
non-current liabilities consist of the following:

Other
liabilities consist primarily of deferred rent, lease contract termination
liabilities for closed stores, leasehold interests liabilities, and rebate
obligations.

Fair value
accounting

On
February 2, 2008, the Company adopted components of SFAS No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements”.

The Company has not adopted SFAS 157 for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements.  SFAS 157 applies to reported balances that are required or
permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements.
Accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of
reported balances.

SFAS
157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an
entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement should be
determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market
participant assumptions in fair value measurements, SFAS 157 establishes a fair
value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based
on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity
(observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy)
and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions
(unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).


Level
1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or
indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs may include
quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as
inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted
prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that
are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability, which are based on an entity’s own
assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances
where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value
hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers
factors specific to the asset or liability.

The
valuation of the Company’s derivative financial instruments is determined using
widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on
the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the
contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses
observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.  The fair
values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard
methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments (or receipts)
and the discounted expected variable cash receipts (or payments).  The
variable cash receipts (or payments) are based on an expectation of future
interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate
curves.

To
comply with the provisions of SFAS 157, the Company incorporates credit
valuation adjustments (CVAs) to appropriately reflect both its own
nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the
fair value measurements.  In adjusting the fair value of its derivative
contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the
impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral
postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.

Although
the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its
derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the CVAs associated
with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit
spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties.
 However, as of January 30, 2009, the Company has assessed the significance
of the impact of the CVAs on the overall valuation of its derivative positions
and has determined that the CVAs are not significant to the overall valuation of
its derivatives. Based on the Company's review of the CVAs by counterparty
portfolio, the Company has determined that the CVAs are not significant to the
overall portfolio valuations, as the CVAs are deemed to be immaterial in terms
of basis points and are a very small percentage of the aggregate notional value.
 Although some of the CVAs as a percentage of termination value appear to
be more significant, primary emphasis was placed on a review of the CVA in basis
points and the percentage of the notional value. As a result, the Company has
determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in
Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.


The
following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of January 30, 2009, aggregated by the level in
the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall.

The
Company does not have any fair value measurements using significant unobservable
inputs (Level 3) as of January 30, 2009.

The
carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments, receivables and payables approximate their
respective fair values.  At January 30, 2009, the fair value of the
Company’s debt, excluding capital lease obligations, was approximately $3.747
billion, or approximately $380.1 million less than the carrying values of the
debt, compared to a fair value of $3.783 billion at February 1, 2008, or
approximately $489.2 million less than the carrying value. The estimated fair
value of the debt is based primarily on quoted prices for those or similar
instruments.

Derivative
financial instruments

The
Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS
No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as
amended and interpreted (collectively, “SFAS 133”). This literature
requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance
sheet at fair value, and contains accounting rules for hedging instruments,
which depend on the nature of the hedge relationship. All financial instrument
positions taken by the Company are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging
an underlying economic exposure.

The
Company’s derivative financial instruments, in the form of interest rate swaps
at January 30, 2009, are related to variable interest rate risk exposures
associated with the Company’s long-term debt and were entered into in an attempt
to manage that risk. The counterparties to the Company’s derivative agreements
are all major international financial institutions. The Company continually
monitors its position and the credit ratings of its counterparties and does not
anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties, however, there can be no
assurance that such nonperformance will not occur.


Share-based
payments

Effective
February 4, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123 (Revised 2004) “Share Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) and began recognizing compensation expense for
share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the grant
date. SFAS 123(R) requires share-based compensation expense recognized since
February 4, 2006 to be based on: (a) grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” for unvested options granted prior to the adoption date and (b)
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R)
for unvested options granted after the adoption date. The Company adopted SFAS
123(R) under the modified-prospective-transition method and, therefore, results
from prior periods have not been restated.

Under
SFAS 123(R), forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce
expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically
based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to
differ, from the prior estimate. The forfeiture rate is the estimated percentage
of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming
fully vested. The Company bases this estimate on historical experience or
estimates of future trends, as applicable. An increase in the forfeiture rate
will decrease compensation expense.

SFAS
123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as required prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R).

The
fair value of each option grant is separately estimated and amortized into
compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the applicable grant date
and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock
option awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves
assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of
compensation expense.

The
Company also accounts for nonvested restricted stock awards in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 123(R). The Company calculates compensation expense as
the difference between the market price of the underlying stock on the grant
date and the purchase price, if any, and recognizes such amount on a
straight-line basis over the period in which the recipient earns the nonvested
restricted stock and restricted stock unit award. Under the provisions of SFAS
123(R), unearned compensation is not recorded within shareholders’ equity.

The
Company has elected to determine its excess tax benefit pool upon adoption of
SFAS 123(R) in accordance with the provisions of FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards.” Under the provisions of this FSP, the cumulative
benefit of stock option exercises included in additional paid-in capital for the
periods after the effective date of SFAS 123 is reduced by the cumulative income
tax effect of the pro forma stock option expense previously disclosed in
accordance with the requirements of SFAS 123. (The provision of this FSP applied
only to options that were fully vested before the date of adoption of SFAS
123(R). The amount of any excess tax benefit for


options
that are either granted after the adoption of SFAS 123(R) or are partially
vested on the date of adoption were computed in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 123(R).) The amount of any excess deferred tax asset over the actual
income tax benefit realized for options that are exercised after the adoption of
SFAS 123(R) will be absorbed by the excess tax benefit pool. Income tax expense
will be increased should the Company’s excess tax benefit pool be insufficient
to absorb any future deferred tax asset amounts in excess of the actual tax
benefit realized. The Company has determined that its excess tax benefit pool
was approximately $68 million as of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on February 4,
2006.  After the Merger and the related application of purchase accounting,
the excess tax benefit pool has been reduced to zero.

Revenue and gain
recognition

The
Company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes
possession of merchandise.  All sales are net of discounts and estimated
returns and are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that
are imposed concurrent with those sales.  The liability for retail
merchandise returns is based on the Company’s prior experience. The Company
records gain contingencies when realized.

The
Company recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption.  The
liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of
purchase. The liability for outstanding gift cards was approximately $1.5
million and $1.2 million at January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, respectively,
and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other. Through January 30, 2009, the
Company has not recorded any breakage income related to its gift card
program.

Advertising
costs

Advertising
costs are expensed upon performance, “first showing” or distribution, and are
reflected net of qualifying cooperative advertising funds provided by vendors in
SG&A expenses. Advertising costs were $27.8 million, $23.6 million, $17.3
million and $45.0 million in 2008, the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods,
and 2006, respectively.  These costs primarily include promotional
circulars, targeted circulars supporting new stores, television and radio
advertising, in-store signage, and costs associated with the sponsorships of
certain automobile racing activities. Vendor funding for cooperative advertising
offset reported expenses by $7.8 million, $6.6 million, $2.0 million and $7.9
million in 2008, the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods, and 2006,
respectively.

Capitalized
interest

To
assure that interest costs properly reflect only that portion relating to
current operations, interest on borrowed funds during the construction of
property and equipment is capitalized.  Interest costs capitalized were
equal to zero in 2008 and the 2007 periods, and were approximately $2.9 million
in 2006.


Income
taxes

The
Company reports income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”).  Under SFAS 109, the asset and liability method
is used for computing the future income tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or income tax
returns.  Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during
the year in the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities.

As
discussed in Note 5, effective February 3, 2007 the Predecessor modified its
method of accounting for income taxes in connection with the adoption of FASB
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An
Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (“FIN 48”). The adoption resulted in an
$8.9 million decrease in retained earnings and a reclassification of certain
amounts between deferred income taxes and other noncurrent liabilities to
conform to the balance sheet presentation requirements of FIN 48. As of the date
of adoption, the total reserve for uncertain tax benefits was $77.9 million.
This reserve excludes the federal income tax benefit for the uncertain tax
positions related to state income taxes, which is now included in deferred tax
assets. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the reserve for interest expense
related to income taxes was increased to $15.3 million and a reserve for
potential penalties of $1.9 million related to uncertain income tax positions
was recorded. As of the date of adoption, approximately $27.1 million of the
reserve for uncertain tax positions would have impacted the Company’s effective
income tax rate subsequently if the Company were to recognize the tax benefit
for these positions.

Subsequent
to the adoption of FIN 48, the Company has elected to record income tax related
interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax expense.

Income
tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by FIN 48.
 FIN 48 requires companies to assess each income tax position taken using a
two step process.  A determination is first made as to whether it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical
merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities.  If the tax position is
expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the
tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position.
 Uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities
to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or
varying interpretation.  If the Company’s determinations and estimates
prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to the
Company’s future financial results.

Management
estimates

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.


Accounting
pronouncements

In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”, an amendment of FASB Statement 133. SFAS
161 applies to all derivative instruments and nonderivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42
of SFAS 133 and related hedged items accounted for under SFAS 133. SFAS 161
requires entities to provide greater transparency through additional disclosures
about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its
related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items
affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
SFAS 161 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that
begins after November 15, 2008.  The Company plans to adopt SFAS 161 during
the first quarter of 2009 and its impact is expected to be limited to the
additional disclosures discussed above.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”. The new
standard establishes the requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and
measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest (formerly minority
interest) in an acquiree; provides updated requirements for recognition and
measurement of goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
bargain purchase; and provides updated disclosure requirements to enable users
of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. This Statement applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Early
adoption is not allowed.  Unless a qualifying transaction is consummated
subsequent to the effective date, the adoption of this standard on the Company’s
financial statements is expected to be limited to any future Merger-related
adjustments to uncertain tax positions that would, if subsequently recognized,
impact results of operations rather than goodwill.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS 157
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The
standard also requires expanded information about the extent to which companies
measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure
fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard
applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be
measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of fair value in
any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. For non-financial assets and liabilities, the effective date has
been delayed to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
adopted components of SFAS 157 in 2008 and currently expects to adopt the
components of SFAS 157 relating to nonfinancial assets and liabilities during
2009. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of this
standard on its consolidated financial statements.


Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications of the 2006 and 2007 amounts have been made to conform to the
2008 presentation.

2.

Merger

On
March 11, 2007, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Merger Agreement”) with Buck Holdings L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
(“Parent”), and Buck, a Tennessee corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent.  Parent is and Buck was (prior to the Merger) controlled by
investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P.
(“KKR”).  On July 6, 2007, the transaction was consummated through a merger
(the “Merger”) of Buck with and into the Company. The Company survived the
Merger as a subsidiary of Parent.  The Company’s results of operations
after July 6, 2007 include the effects of the Merger.

The
aggregate purchase price was approximately $7.1 billion, including direct costs
of the Merger, and was funded primarily through debt financings as described
more fully below in Note 6 and cash equity contributions from KKR, GS Capital
Partners VI Fund, L.P. and affiliated funds (affiliates of Goldman, Sachs &
Co.), Citi Private Equity, Wellington Management Company, LLP, CPP Investment
Board (USRE II) Inc., and other equity co-investors (collectively, the
“Investors”) of approximately $2.8 billion (553.4 million shares of new common
stock, $0.50 par value per share, valued at $5.00 per share).  Also in
connection with the Merger, certain of the Company’s management employees
invested in and were issued new shares, representing less than 1% of the
outstanding shares, in the Company.  Pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement, the former holders of the Predecessor’s common stock, par value $0.50
per share, received $22.00 per share, or approximately $6.9 billion, and all
such shares were acquired as a result of the Merger. As of January 30, 2009 and
February 1, 2008, there were approximately 556,227,947 and 555,481,897 shares of
Company common stock outstanding, respectively, a portion of which is redeemable
as further discussed below in Note 10.

As
discussed in Note 1, the Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in
accordance with the purchase accounting provisions of SFAS 141, “Business
Combinations”.  Because of this accounting treatment, the Company’s assets
and liabilities have properly been accounted for at their estimated fair values
as of the Merger date.  The aggregate purchase price has been allocated to
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon
an assessment of their relative fair values as of the Merger date.


The
allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):

The
purchase price allocation as of January 30, 2009 included approximately $4.34
billion of goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.  The goodwill balance at February 1, 2008 increased by $21.3
million over the balance immediately following the Merger, representing a
refinement of the purchase price allocation related to the Merger. The goodwill
balance at January 30, 2009 decreased $6.3 million from February 1, 2008 due to
an adjustment to income tax contingencies as further discussed in Note 5. The
purchase price allocation as of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008 also
included approximately $1.4 billion of other intangible assets, as follows:

The
Company recorded amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets
for 2008 and the 2007 Successor period of $45.0 million and $26.1 million,
respectively, ($40.9 million and $23.7 million, respectively, of which is
included in rent expense).


For
intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated aggregate amortization
expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows: 2009 - $41.1
million, 2010 - $27.3 million, 2011 - $20.9 million, 2012 - $17.0 million, and
2013 - $12.0 million.

Fees
and expenses related to the Merger totaled $102.6 million, principally
consisting of investment banking fees, legal fees and stock compensation ($39.4
million as further discussed in Note 10), and are reflected in the 2007 results
of operations.  Capitalized debt issuance costs as of the Merger date of
$87.4 million for Merger-related financing were reflected in other long-term
assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

The
following represents the unaudited pro forma results of the Company’s
consolidated operations as if the Merger had occurred on February 3, 2007 and
February 4, 2006, respectively, after giving effect to certain adjustments,
including the depreciation and amortization of the assets acquired based on
their estimated fair values and changes in interest expense resulting from
changes in consolidated debt (in thousands):

Subsequent
to the announcement of the Merger Agreement, the Company and its directors,
along with other parties, were named in seven putative class actions filed in
Tennessee state courts alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty arising out
of the proposed Merger, all as described more fully under “Legal Proceedings” in
Note 8 below.

3.

Strategic
initiatives

During
2006, the Company began implementing certain strategic initiatives related to
its historical inventory management and real estate strategies, as more fully
described below.

Inventory
management

In
November 2006, the Company undertook an initiative to discontinue its historical
inventory packaway model for virtually all merchandise by the end of fiscal
2007. Under the packaway model, certain unsold inventory items (primarily
seasonal merchandise) were stored on-site and returned to the sales floor until
the items were eventually sold, damaged or discarded. Through end-of-season and
other markdowns, this initiative resulted in the elimination of seasonal, home
products and basic clothing packaway merchandise to allow for increased levels
of newer, current-season merchandise.  In connection with this strategic
change, in the third quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a reserve for lower of
cost or market inventory


impairment
estimates of $63.5 million and incurred higher markdowns and writedowns on
inventory in the second half of 2006 and in 2007 than in comparable prior-year
periods.  As a result of the Merger and in accordance with SFAS 141, the
Company’s inventory balances, including the inventory associated with this
strategic change, were adjusted to fair value and the related reserve was
eliminated.

Exit and disposal
activities

In
November 2006, the Company decided to close, in addition to those stores that
might be closed in the ordinary course of business, approximately 400 stores by
the end of fiscal 2007, all of which were closed by February 1, 2008.
 Additionally, in connection with the Merger, management approved and
completed a plan to close an additional 60 stores prior to February 1, 2008.
 The Company has recorded the following pre-tax costs associated with the
closing of these approximately 460 stores (in millions):

(a)

Reflects amounts as of January 30,
2009, which, in total, are $3.6 million greater than estimates as of February 1,
2008.

(b)

These amounts were recorded as
assumed liabilities in connection with the Merger.

(c)

Including reversals of deferred rent
accruals totaling $0.5 million, of which $0.1 million is reflected in 2006, and
$0.4 million is reflected in 2007.  Excludes accretion expense to be
incurred in future periods.

Other
associated store closing costs as listed in the table above primarily include
the removal of any usable assets as well as real estate consulting and other
services.

Liability
balances related to exit activities discussed above are as follows (in
millions):

(a)

2008 expenses associated with exit
and disposal activities are included in selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

(b)

Primarily represents store closing
costs including removal of store fixtures.


4.

Property
and equipment

Property
and equipment is recorded at cost and summarized as follows:

Depreciation
expense related to property and equipment was approximately $190.5 million for
2008, $116.9 million for the 2007 Successor period, $83.5 million for the 2007
Predecessor period, and $199.6 million for 2006.  Amortization of capital
lease assets is included in depreciation expense.

5.

Income
taxes

The
provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following:


A
reconciliation between actual income taxes and amounts computed by applying the
federal statutory rate to income before income taxes is summarized as
follows:

The
2008 effective income tax rate is an expense of 44.4%.  This expense is
greater than the expected U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% principally due to the
non-deductibility of the settlement and related expenses associated with the
Merger-related shareholder lawsuit.

The
income tax rate for the Successor period ended February 1, 2008 is a benefit of
26.9%.  This benefit is less than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 35%
due to the incurrence of state income taxes in several of the group’s
subsidiaries that file their state income tax returns on a separate entity basis
and the election to include, effective February 3, 2007, income tax related
interest and penalties in the amount reported as income tax expense.

The
income tax rate for the Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007 is an expense of
300.2%.  This expense is higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of
35% due principally to the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related
expenses.

The
2006 income tax rate was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% principally
due to state income taxes.

Deferred
taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities are as follows:


Net
deferred tax liabilities are reflected separately on the consolidated balance
sheets as current and noncurrent deferred income taxes. The following table
summarizes net deferred tax liabilities as recorded in the consolidated balance
sheets:

The
Company has state net operating loss carryforwards as of January 30, 2009 that
total approximately $307.7 million which will expire in 2013 through 2028.
 The Company also has state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $20.8
million that will expire beginning in 2009 through 2027.

The
valuation allowance has been provided for federal capital losses and state tax
credit carryforwards.  The 2008 increase of $8.2 million was recorded as
income tax expense of $3.0 million and an adjustment to goodwill of $5.2
million.  The full amount of the change in the valuation allowance for the
2007 Successor period, a decrease of $4.2 million, was recorded as an adjustment
to goodwill. The increase of $0.6 million in the Predecessor period ended July
6, 2007 and the increase of $3.2 million in 2006 were included in income tax
expense for the respective periods.  Based upon expected future income,
management believes that it is more


likely
than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income
to realize the deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the valuation
allowance.

During
2008, goodwill recorded in connection with the Merger was reduced by $6.3
million principally as a result of the favorable settlement of uncertain income
tax positions that existed at the time of the Merger.

The
Predecessor adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective February 3, 2007.
 The adoption resulted in an $8.9 million decrease in retained earnings and
a reclassification of certain amounts between deferred income taxes and other
noncurrent liabilities to conform to the balance sheet presentation requirements
of FIN 48.  As of the date of adoption, the total uncertain tax benefits
were $77.9 million.  This amount excludes the federal income tax benefit
for the uncertain tax positions related to state income taxes, which is included
in deferred tax assets.  As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the reserve
for interest expense related to income taxes was increased to $15.3 million and
a reserve for potential penalties of $1.9 million related to uncertain income
tax positions was recorded.

Subsequent
to the adoption of FIN 48, the Company has elected to record income tax related
interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax
expense.

In
the Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service
completed an examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns through
fiscal year 2003 resulting in a net income tax refund.  There are no
unresolved issues related to this examination.  None of the Company’s
federal income tax returns are currently under examination by the Internal
Revenue Service; however, fiscal years 2005 and later are still subject to
possible examination by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Company has
various state income tax examinations that are currently in progress.  The
estimated liability related to these state income tax examinations is included
in the Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions.  Generally, the
Company’s tax years ended in 2005 and forward remain open for examination by the
various state taxing authorities.

As
of January 30, 2009, the total uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related
to income taxes and potential income tax penalties were $59.1 million, $11.3
million and $1.5 million, respectively, for a total of $71.9 million.  Of
this amount, $20.8 million and $47.3 million are reflected in current
liabilities as accrued expenses and other and in other noncurrent liabilities,
respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet with the remaining $3.8 million
reducing deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards.

As
of February 1, 2008, the total uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related
to income taxes and potential income tax penalties were $96.6 million, $19.7
million and $1.5 million, respectively, for a total of $117.8 million.  Of
this amount, $23.2 million and $78.3 are reflected in current liabilities as
accrued expenses and other and in other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, in
the consolidated balance sheet with the remaining $16.3 million reducing
deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carry forwards.


The
change, from the date of adoption, through the end of the Predecessor period
ended July 6, 2007 in the uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to
income taxes and potential income tax penalties that impacted the consolidated
statement of operations was a net increase of $10.4 million and $0.2 million and
a decrease of $0.4 million, respectively.  The change, from the end of the
Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007, through the end of the Successor period
ended February 1, 2008, in the uncertain tax benefits and interest expense
related to income taxes that impacted the consolidated statement of operations
was a net increase of $0.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
  There was no change in the reserve for potential income tax
penalties during the Successor period ended February 1, 2008.

During
2008, the Company included in its consolidated statement of operations a net
increase of $0.8 million, a net decrease of $1.0 million and a net increase of
$0.3 million related to uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to
income taxes and potential tax penalties, respectively. The net decrease in
interest expense related to uncertain tax positions is due to the reduction
during 2008 in amounts previously accrued related to uncertain tax
positions.

The
Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain
tax positions may be reduced by approximately $33.6 million in the coming twelve
months principally as a result of the settlement of currently ongoing state
income tax examinations and the anticipated filing of an income tax accounting
method change request that is expected to resolve certain uncertainties related
to accounting methods employed by the Company.  The reasonably possible
change of $33.6 million is included in both current liabilities ($20.1 million)
and other noncurrent liabilities ($13.5 million) in the consolidated balance
sheet as of January 30, 2009. Also, as of January 30, 2009, approximately $23.9
million of the uncertain tax positions would impact the Company’s effective
income tax rate if the Company were to recognize the tax benefit for these
positions.

A
reconciliation of the uncertain income tax positions from February 3, 2007 (the
date of adoption) through January 30, 2009 is as follows:

Current
and long-term obligations

Current
and long-term obligations consist of the following:

On
July 6, 2007, the Company entered into two senior secured credit agreements (the
“Credit Facilities”).  The Credit Facilities provide financing of $3.425
billion, consisting of $2.3 billion in a senior secured term loan facility which
matures on July 6, 2014, and a senior secured asset-based revolving credit
facility of up to $1.125 billion, subject to borrowing base availability, which
matures on July 6, 2013.

Under
the Credit Facilities, the Company has the right at any time to request up to
$325.0 million of incremental commitments under one or more incremental term
loan facilities and/or asset-based revolving credit facilities, subject to
certain conditions and subject to the lender’s desire to extend the incremental
facilities.

The
amount available under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility
(including up to $350.0 million for letters of credit) may not exceed the
borrowing base (consisting of specified percentages of eligible inventory and
credit card receivables less any applicable availability reserves).  The
senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility includes a $1.0 billion
tranche and a $125.0 million (“last out”) tranche.  Repayments of the
senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility will be applied to the
$125.0 million tranche only after all other tranches have been fully paid down.
 As of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, the Company had outstanding
borrowings of $0 and $102.5 million, respectively, under the “last out” tranche.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable
margin plus, at the Company’s option, either (a) LIBOR or (b) a base rate (which
is usually equal to the prime rate).  The applicable margin for borrowings
is (i) under the term loan facility, 2.75% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.75% for
base-rate borrowings (ii) as of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008,
respectively, under the asset-based revolving credit facility (except in the
last out tranche described above), 1.25% and 1.50% for LIBOR borrowings; 0.25%
and 0.50% for base-rate borrowings and for any last out borrowings, 2.25% for
LIBOR borrowings and 1.25% for base-rate borrowings.  The applicable
margins for borrowings under the asset-based revolving credit facility (except
in the case of last out borrowings) are subject to adjustment each quarter based
on average daily excess availability under the asset-based revolving credit
facility.


As
of February 1, 2008, the average interest rate for borrowings under the
revolving credit facility was 6.35%.  The interest rate for borrowings
under the term loan facility was 3.44% and 6.22% (without giving effect to the
interest rate swaps discussed in Note 7) as of January 30, 2009 and February 1,
2008, respectively.

In
addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit
Facilities, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under
the asset-based revolving credit facility for any unutilized commitments.
 The commitment fee rate is 0.375% per annum.  The commitment fee rate
will be reduced (except with regard to the last out tranche) to 0.25% per annum
at any time that the unutilized commitments under the asset-based credit
facility are equal to or less than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the
asset-based revolving credit facility.  The Company also must pay customary
letter of credit fees.

The
senior secured credit agreement for the term loan facility requires the Company
to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with
percentages of excess cash flow, proceeds of non-ordinary course asset sales or
dispositions of property, and proceeds of incurrences of certain debt.  In
addition, the senior secured credit agreement for the asset-based revolving
credit facility requires the Company to prepay the asset-based revolving credit
facility, subject to certain exceptions, with proceeds of non-ordinary course
asset sales or dispositions of property and any borrowings in excess of the then
current borrowing base.  Beginning September 30, 2009, the Company is
required to repay installments on the loans under the term loan credit facility
in equal quarterly principal amounts in an aggregate amount per annum equal to
1% of the total funded principal amount at July 6, 2007, with the balance
payable on July 6, 2014.

All
obligations under the Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by
substantially all of the Company’s existing and future domestic subsidiaries
(excluding certain immaterial subsidiaries and certain subsidiaries designated
by the Company under the Credit Facilities as “unrestricted subsidiaries”).

All
obligations and guarantees of those obligations under the term loan credit
facility are secured by, subject to certain exceptions, a second-priority
security interest in all existing and after-acquired inventory and accounts
receivable; a first priority security interest in substantially all of the
Company’s and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets (other than the
inventory and accounts receivable collateral); and a first-priority pledge of
the capital stock held by the Company.  All obligations under the
asset-based revolving credit facility are secured by all existing and
after-acquired inventory and accounts receivable, subject to certain
exceptions.

The
Credit Facilities contain certain covenants, including, among other things,
covenants that limit the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness,
sell assets, incur additional liens, pay dividends, make investments or
acquisitions, or repay certain indebtedness.

For
the year ended January 30, 2009, the Company had borrowings of $0 and repayments
of $102.5 million, and for the 2007 Successor period the Company had borrowings
of $1.522 billion and repayments of $1.420 billion, under the asset based
revolving credit facility. For the year ended February 2, 2007, the Company had
borrowings of $2.013 billion and repayments of $2.013 billion, under a prior
revolving credit facility. As of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008,
respectively, the Company had $0 and $102.5 million in borrowings, $51.0 million
and


$28.8
million of commercial letters of credit, and $83.7 million and $69.2 million of
standby letters of credit outstanding under the asset-based revolving credit
facility, with excess availability under that facility of $932.8 million and
$769.2 million.  As of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, the Company
had $2.3 billion outstanding under the term loan facility.

In
addition, on July 6, 2007, in conjunction with the Merger, the Company issued
$1.175 billion aggregate principal amount of 10.625% senior notes due 2015 (the
“senior notes”) which were issued net of a discount of $23.2 million and which
mature on July 15, 2015 pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 6, 2007 (the
“senior indenture”), and $725 million aggregate principal amount of
11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017 (the “senior
subordinated notes”), which mature on July 15, 2017, pursuant to an indenture,
dated as of July 6, 2007 (the “senior subordinated indenture”).  The senior
notes and the senior subordinated notes are collectively referred to herein as
the “notes”.  The senior indenture and the senior subordinated indenture
are collectively referred to herein as the “indentures”.

Interest
on the notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning
January 15, 2008.  Interest on the senior notes is payable in cash.
 Cash interest on the senior subordinated notes will accrue at a rate of
11.875% per annum and PIK interest (as that term is defined below) will accrue
at a rate of 12.625% per annum.  For certain interest periods, the Company
may elect to pay interest on the senior subordinated notes by increasing the
principal amount of the senior subordinated notes or issuing new senior
subordinated notes (“PIK interest”).

The
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of the existing and
future direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the
obligations under the Company’s Credit Facilities.

The
Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time at redemption prices
described or set forth in the indentures. In January 2009 and January 2008, the
Company repurchased $44.1 million and $25.0 million, respectively, of the
11.875%/12.625% senior subordinated toggle notes due 2017, resulting in pretax
gains of $3.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively.

The
indentures contain certain covenants, including, among other things, covenants
that limit the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens,
sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, or consolidate or dispose
of all of its assets.

Scheduled
debt maturities for the Company’s fiscal years listed below are as follows (in
thousands): 2009 - $14,158; 2010 - $26,415; 2011 - $23,779; 2012 - $23,272; 2013
- - $23,292 thereafter - $4,046,132.

On
July 6, 2007, immediately after the completion of the Merger, the Company
completed a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its $200 million
principal amount of 8 5/8% Notes due June 2010 (the “2010 Notes”).
 Approximately 99% of the 2010 Notes were validly tendered and accepted for
payment.  The tender offer included a consent payment equal to 3% of the
par value of the 2010 Notes, and such payments along with associated settlement
costs totaling $6.2 million were paid and reflected as Other (income) expense in
the 2007


Successor
period presented.  Additionally, because the Company received the requisite
consents to the proposed amendments to the indenture pursuant to which the 2010
Notes were issued, a supplemental indenture to effect such amendments was
executed and delivered.  The amendments, which eliminated substantially all
of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture, became operative upon
the purchase of the tendered 2010 Notes.

Derivative
financial instruments

The
Company uses interest rate swaps

to manage its interest rate

risk.
In April 2007, Buck entered into interest rate swaps, contingent upon the
completion of the Merger, on a portion of the loans anticipated to result from
the Merger. These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges on October 12, 2007.
As a result of these swaps, the Company is paying an all-in fixed interest rate
of 7.68% on a notional amount equal to $866.7 million as of January 30, 2009.
The notional amount of these swaps amortizes on a quarterly basis through July
31, 2012. Unrealized losses of $3.7 million for the 2007 Successor period are
included in Other (income) expense in the consolidated statements of operations,
reflecting the changes in fair value of these swaps prior to their designation
as qualifying cash flow hedging relationships in October 2007, which were offset
by earnings under the contractual provisions of the swaps of $1.7 million during
the same time period.

In
October 2008 the Company terminated one of the interest rate swaps entered into
by Buck in April 2007 with a notional amount equal to $486.7 million as of the
date of termination. The termination was the result of the bankruptcy
declaration by the counterparty to the swap and this technical default gave the
Company the right to terminate the derivative contract.  The Company
subsequently cash settled the swap in November 2008 for approximately $7.6
million, including interest accrued to the date of termination.

The
estimated fair value of the Company’s terminated interest rate swap was a
liability of approximately $5.0 million as of October 30, 2008 (the termination
date). Based on various factors, the Company concluded that the hedge was
expected to be highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows attributable
to the hedged risk, and has therefore applied hedge accounting for this interest
rate swap through the termination date.

Upon
termination, the Company performed the final effectiveness test, and the amount
related to the gains and losses since the hedge designation date of
approximately $3.7 million (after adjusting for the termination) remained in
Accumulated other comprehensive loss at the termination date. Such amount is
being reclassified into earnings as interest expense over the term of the
original swap as the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings and this
expense is expected to be approximately $1.4 million in 2009.

In
February and December 2008, the Company entered into additional interest rate
swaps, each of which were designated as cash flow hedges at inception. At
January 30, 2009, the Company is paying all-in fixed interest rates of 5.58% and
5.06% on notional amounts of $350.0 million and $475.0 million, respectively,
pursuant to the February 2008 and December 2008 swaps. The notional amount of
the February 2008 swap reduces to $150.0 million in February


and matures in February 2010. The December 2008 swap amortizes to a notional
amount of $300.0 million upon its maturity in January 2013.

As
of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s
interest rate swaps of $(63.5) million and $(82.3) million was recorded in
non-current Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For the year
ended January 30, 2009, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the
swaps of $14.2 million was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a
separate component of equity, offset by related income taxes of $4.5 million.
From the date the swaps were designated as hedges to February 1, 2008, the
effective portion of the change in fair value of the swaps of ($78.6) million
was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, offset by related income
taxes of $29.5 million. The Company also recorded expense in Other (income)
expense in the consolidated statements of operations related to hedge
ineffectiveness of $1.0 million and $0.4 million during 2008 and the 2007
Successor period, respectively.

In
February 2009, the Company entered into a contract to hedge approximately 50% of
its anticipated 2009 fuel usage related to the transportation of merchandise.
Such contract is not expected to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and as
a result, gains or losses under this contract will be recorded in Other (gains)
losses in the consolidated statement of operations.

Commitments
and contingencies

Leases

As
of January 30, 2009, the Company was committed under capital and operating lease
agreements and financing obligations for most of its retail stores, three of its
DCs, and certain of its furniture, fixtures and equipment.  The majority of
the Company’s stores are subject to short-term leases (usually with initial or
current terms of three to five years), often with multiple renewal options.
 The Company also has stores subject to build-to-suit arrangements with
landlords, which typically carry a primary lease term of 10 years with multiple
renewal options. Approximately 42% of the stores have provisions for contingent
rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume.  Certain leases
contain restrictive covenants.  As of January 30, 2009, the Company is not
aware of any material violations of such covenants.

The
Merger and certain of the related financing transactions may be interpreted as
giving rise to certain trigger events (which may include events of default)
under leases for three of the Company’s distribution centers (“DCs”). The
Company does not believe such an interpretation would be appropriate under the
terms of the leases. During the 2007 Successor period, the Company concluded
that a probable loss existed in connection with the restructurings and accrued
SG&A expenses totaling $12.0 million in the Successor statement of
operations for the period ended February 1, 2008. As of January 30, 2009, $7.0
million of such amount has been paid. The Company believes that it has
negotiated with the property owners proposed lease terms that would be
implemented if the owners were to refinance or sell the property and that the
resolution of these negotiations is primarily dependent on conditions in the
real estate and financial markets. The Company’s current position is that any
remaining potential loss on the resolution of these matters would currently be
properly characterized as reasonably possible rather than probable and has
therefore reversed the remaining $5.0 million of SG&A expenses


related
to the leases during the year ended January 30, 2009. However, the possibility
remains that the ultimate resolution of these matters could require the Company
to make a significant cash investment to purchase these DCs.

In
January 1999 and April 1997, the Company sold its DCs located in Ardmore,
Oklahoma and South Boston, Virginia, respectively, for 100% cash consideration.
 Concurrent with the sale transactions, the Company leased the properties
back for periods of 23 and 25 years, respectively.  The transactions were
recorded as financing obligations rather than sales as a result of, among other
things, the lessor’s ability to put the properties back to the Company under
certain circumstances.  The property and equipment, along with the related
lease obligations, associated with these transactions were recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets.

In
August 2007, the Company purchased a secured promissory note (the “Ardmore
Note”) from Principal Life Insurance Company, which had a face value of $34.3
million at the date of purchase and approximated the remaining financing
obligation. The Ardmore Note represents debt issued by the third party entity
from which the Company leases the Ardmore DC. The Ardmore Note is being
accounted for as a “held to maturity” debt security in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities” (see Note 1). However, by acquiring the Ardmore Note, the Company
holds the debt instrument pertaining to its lease financing obligation and,
because a legal right of offset exists, is accounting for the acquired Ardmore
Note as a reduction of its outstanding financing obligations in its consolidated
balance sheets as of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008 in accordance with
the provisions of FASB Interpretation 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to
Certain Contracts – An Interpretation of APB Opinion 10 and FASB Statement
105.”

In
May 2003, the Company purchased two secured promissory notes (the “South Boston
Notes”) from Principal Life Insurance Company totaling $49.6 million. The South
Boston Notes represented debt issued by the third party entity from which the
Company leased the South Boston DC. In June 2006, the Company acquired the third
party entity, which owned legal title to the South Boston DC assets and had
issued the related debt in connection with the original financing transaction.
There was no material gain or loss recognized as a result of this transaction.
Based on the Company’s ownership of the third party entity at January 30, 2009,
the financing obligation and South Boston Notes are eliminated in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.


Future
minimum payments as of January 30, 2009 for capital and operating leases are as
follows:

Capital
leases were discounted at an effective interest rate of approximately 5.4% at
January 30, 2009.  The gross amount of property and equipment recorded
under capital leases and financing obligations at January 30, 2009 and February
1, 2008, was $34.8 million and $33.5 million, respectively.  Accumulated
depreciation on property and equipment under capital leases and financing
obligations at January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008, was $5.3 million and $2.7
million, respectively.

Rent
expense under all operating leases is as follows:

Legal
proceedings

On
August 7, 2006, a lawsuit entitled

Cynthia Richter, et al. v.
Dolgencorp, Inc., et al.

was filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama (Case No. 7:06-cv-01537-LSC)
(“Richter”) in which the plaintiff alleges that she and other current and former
Dollar General store managers were improperly classified as exempt executive
employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and seeks to recover
overtime pay,


liquidated
damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On August 15, 2006, the Richter
plaintiff filed a motion in which she asked the court to certify a nationwide
class of current and former store managers. The Company opposed the plaintiff’s
motion. On March 23, 2007, the court conditionally certified a nationwide
class of individuals who worked for Dollar General as store managers since
August 7, 2003. The number of persons who will be included in the class has
not been determined, and the court has not approved the Notice that will be sent
to the class.

On
May 30, 2007, the court stayed all proceedings in the case, including the
sending of the Notice, to evaluate, among other things, certain appeals pending
in the Eleventh Circuit involving claims similar to those raised in this action.
That stay was extended through May 15, 2009. During the stay, the statute of
limitations has been tolled for potential class members. If the court ultimately
permits Notice to issue, the Company will have an opportunity at the close of
the discovery period to seek decertification of the class, and the Company
expects to file such a motion if necessary.

The
Company believes that its store managers are and have been properly classified
as exempt employees under the FLSA and that this action is not appropriate for
collective action treatment. The Company intends to vigorously defend this
action. However, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether the court
ultimately will permit this action to proceed collectively, and no assurances
can be given that the Company will be successful in the defense on the merits or
otherwise. If the Company is not successful in its efforts to defend this
action, the resolution could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial statements as a whole.

On
May 18, 2006, the Company was served with a lawsuit entitled

Tammy
Brickey, Becky Norman, Rose Rochow, Sandra Cogswell and Melinda Sappington v.
Dolgencorp, Inc. and Dollar General Corporation

(Western District of
New York, Case No. 6:06-cv-06084-DGL, originally filed on February 9,
2006 and amended on May 12, 2006 (“Brickey”)). The Brickey plaintiffs seek
to proceed collectively under the FLSA and as a class under New York, Ohio,
Maryland and North Carolina wage and hour statutes on behalf of, among others,
assistant store managers who claim to be owed wages (including overtime wages)
under those statutes. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether the
court will permit this action to proceed collectively or as a class. However,
the Company believes that this action is not appropriate for either collective
or class treatment and that the Company’s wage and hour policies and practices
comply with both federal and state law. The Company plans to vigorously defend
this action; however, no assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in the defense on the merits or otherwise, and, if it is not
successful, the resolution of this action could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial statements as a whole.

On
March 7, 2006, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama (

Janet Calvert v.
Dolgencorp, Inc.

, Case No. 2:06-cv-00465-VEH (“Calvert”)), in
which the plaintiff, a former store manager, alleged that she was paid less than
male store managers because of her sex, in violation of the Equal Pay Act and
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (“Title VII”). The
complaint subsequently was amended to include additional plaintiffs, who also
allege to have been paid less than males because of their sex, and to add
allegations that the Company’s compensation practices disparately impact
females. Under the amended complaint, Plaintiffs seek to proceed collectively
under the Equal


Pay
Act and as a class under Title VII, and request back wages, injunctive and
declaratory relief, liquidated damages, punitive damages and attorney’s fees and
costs.

On
July 9, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion in which they asked the court
to approve the issuance of notice to a class of current and former female store
managers under the Equal Pay Act. The Company opposed plaintiffs’ motion. On
November 30, 2007, the court conditionally certified a nationwide class of
females under the Equal Pay Act who worked for Dollar General as store managers
between November 30, 2004 and November 30, 2007. The notice was issued
on January 11, 2008, and persons to whom the notice was sent were required
to opt into the suit by March 11, 2008. Approximately 2,100 individuals
have opted into the lawsuit.  The Company will have an opportunity at the
close of the discovery period to seek decertification of the Equal Pay Act
class, and the Company expects to file such motion.

The
plaintiffs have not yet moved for class certification relating to their Title
VII claims.  The Company expects such motion to be filed within the next
several months and will strenuously oppose such a motion.

At
this time, it is not possible to predict whether the court ultimately will
permit the Calvert action to proceed collectively under the Equal Pay Act or as
a class under Title VII. However, the Company believes that the case is not
appropriate for class or collective treatment and that its policies and
practices comply with the Equal Pay Act and Title VII.  The Company intends
to vigorously defend the action; however, no assurances can be given that the
Company will be successful in the defense on the merits or otherwise. If the
Company is not successful in defending the Calvert action, its resolution could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
whole.

On
July 30, 2008, the Company was served with a complaint filed in the District
Court for Dallas County, Iowa (

Julie Cox, et al. v. Dolgencorp, Inc., et
al

– Case No. LACV-034423) in which the plaintiff, a former store manager,
alleges that the Company discriminates against pregnant employees on the basis
of sex and retaliates against employees in violation of the Iowa Civil Rights
Act.  Cox seeks to represent a class of “all current, former and future
employees from the State of Iowa who are employed by Dollar General who suffered
from, are currently suffering from or in the future may suffer from” alleged
sex/pregnancy discrimination and retaliation and seeks declaratory and
injunctive relief as well as equitable, compensatory and punitive damages and
attorneys’ fees and costs.

The
plaintiff has not yet moved for class certification.  At this time, it is
not possible to predict whether the court ultimately will permit the

Cox

action to proceed as a class. However, the Company believes that the case is not
appropriate for class treatment and that its policies and practices comply with
the Iowa Civil Rights Act.  The Company intends to vigorously defend the
action; however, no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful
in the defense on the merits or otherwise. If the Company is not successful in
defending this action, its resolution could have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial statements as a whole.


On
December 4, 2008, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Tennessee (

Tressa Holt, et al v. Dollar General
Corporation, et al.

, Case No.1:08-cv-01298 JDB) in which the plaintiff, on
behalf of herself and a putative class of non-exempt store employees, alleges
that the Company violated the Fair Labor Standards Act by failing to pay for all
hours worked, including overtime hours. At this time, it is not possible to
predict whether the court will permit this action to proceed collectively.
 However, the Company believes that this action is not appropriate for
collective treatment and that the Company’s wage and hour policies and practices
comply with the FLSA. The Company plans to vigorously defend this action;
however, no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in the
defense on the merits or otherwise, and, if it is not successful, the resolution
of this action could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
statements as a whole.

Subsequent
to the announcement of the agreement relating to the Merger, the Company and its
directors were named in seven putative class actions alleging claims for breach
of fiduciary duty arising out of the Company’s proposed sale to KKR. Each of the
complaints alleged, among other things, that the Company’s directors engaged in
“self-dealing” by agreeing to recommend the transaction to the Company’s
shareholders and that the consideration available to such shareholders in the
transaction is unfairly low. On motion of the plaintiffs, each of these cases
was transferred to the Sixth Circuit Court for Davidson County, Twentieth
Judicial District, at Nashville. By order dated April 26, 2007, the seven
lawsuits were consolidated in the court under the caption, “In re: Dollar
General,” Case No. 07MD-1. On June 13, 2007, the court denied the
Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary injunction to block the shareholder vote that
was then held on June 21, 2007. On June 22, 2007, the Plaintiffs filed
their amended complaint making claims substantially similar to those outlined
above. The court on November 6, 2008 certified a class of all persons who held
stock in the Company on the date of the Merger.  The defendants filed for
summary judgment.

On
November 24, 2008, all defendants, including the Company, reached an agreement
in principle to settle this lawsuit, subject to final documentation and court
approval. The Company determined that the agreement would be in the best
interest of the Company to avoid costly and time consuming litigation. Based on
the agreement in principle, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $34.5
million in the third quarter of 2008 in connection with the proposed settlement,
net of anticipated insurance proceeds of $7.5 million. In the fourth quarter,
the Company ultimately collected $10 million in insurance proceeds ($2.5 million
more than the anticipated amount), and on February 2, 2009, the Company funded
the settlement. On February 11, 2009, the court approved the terms of the
settlement. The additional $2.5 million in insurance proceeds received in the
fourth quarter of 2008 has been recorded as a reduction of Litigation settlement
and related costs, net in the 2008 statement of operations. Additional
adjustments, not expected to be material, may be made to the estimated
additional legal fees and costs.

From
time to time, the Company is a party to various other legal actions involving
claims incidental to the conduct of its business, including actions by
employees, consumers, suppliers, government agencies, or others through private
actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other
litigation, including under federal and state employment laws and wage and hour
laws.  The Company believes, based upon information currently available,
that such other litigation and claims, both individually and in the aggregate,
will be


resolved
without a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements as a
whole. However, litigation involves an element of uncertainty. Future
developments could cause these actions or claims to have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, or financial
position. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to the
Company or settled by the Company, may result in liability material to the
Company’s financial position or may negatively affect operating results if
changes to the Company’s business operation are required.

Other

In
August of 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 was signed
into law.  The new law addresses, among other things, the permissible
levels of lead and listed phthalates in certain products.  The first tier
of new standards for permissible levels of lead and phthalates became effective
in February 2009; the second tier is effective in August 2009. To ensure
compliance, the Company undertook a process during the fourth quarter of 2008 to
identify, mark down and cease the sale of any remaining inventory that would be
impacted by the new law. The effect of these markdowns resulted in a 2008 charge
of $8.6 million included in Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of
operations. The Company is continuing to evaluate its inventory for the next
implementation phase of the new law, but does not currently expect the impact of
this process to be material to its financial statements. Until the process is
complete, however, the Company cannot definitely rule out that possibility.

Benefit
plans

The
Dollar General Corporation 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, which became
effective on January 1, 1998, is a safe harbor defined contribution plan and is
subject to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (“ERISA”).

Participants
are permitted to contribute between 1% and 25% of their pre-tax annual eligible
compensation as defined in the 401(k) plan document, subject to certain
limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  Employees who are over age 50
are permitted to contribute additional amounts on a pre-tax basis under the
catch-up provision of the 401(k) plan subject to Internal Revenue Code
limitations. The Company currently matches employee contributions, including
catch-up contributions, at a rate of 100% of employee contributions up to 5% of
annual eligible salary, after an employee has been employed for one year and has
completed a minimum of 1,000 hours of service.

A
participant’s right to claim a distribution of his or her account balance is
dependent on ERISA guidelines and Internal Revenue Service regulations. All
active employees are fully vested in all contributions to the 401(k) plan.
During 2008, the 2007 Successor and Predecessor periods, and 2006, the Company
expensed approximately $8.0 million, $3.0 million, $4.3 million, and $6.4
million, respectively, for matching contributions. The Merger did not
significantly impact the comparability of such expense amounts between
periods.

The
Company also has a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”) and
compensation deferral plan (“CDP”), called the Dollar General Corporation
CDP/SERP Plan, for


a
select group of management and highly compensated employees.  The
supplemental retirement plan is a noncontributory defined contribution plan with
annual Company contributions ranging from 2% to 12% of base pay plus bonus
depending upon age plus years of service and job grade.  Under the CDP,
participants may defer up to 65% of base pay and up to 100% of bonus pay. An
employee may be designated for participation in one or both of the plans,
according to the eligibility requirements of the plans. The Company matches base
pay deferrals at a rate of 100% of base pay deferral, up to 5% of annual salary,
with annual salary offset by the amount of match-eligible salary in the 401(k)
plan. All participants are 100% vested in their CDP accounts.

Effective
May 22, 2008, CDP eligibility changed as follows: to be eligible for CDP salary
deferrals, individuals must earn compensation in excess of the IRS limit under
IRC 401(a)(17) and to be eligible for CDP bonus deferrals, individuals must earn
compensation in excess of the IRS highly compensated limit under Section
414(q)(1)(B). Also, effective May 28, 2008, SERP eligibility was frozen and
management or highly compensated employees hired on or after that date are not
eligible for SERP participation.

As
a result of the Merger which constituted a “change in control” under the
CDP/SERP Plan, all previously unvested amounts under the SERP vested on July 6,
2007.  For newly eligible SERP participants after July 6, 2007, the SERP
accounts vest at the earlier of the participant’s attainment of age 50 or the
participant’s being credited with 10 or more “years of service”, upon
termination of employment due to death or “total and permanent disability” or
upon a “change in control”, all as defined in the CDP/SERP Plan.  The
Company incurred compensation expense for these plans of approximately $1.2
million in 2008, $0.3 million in the 2007 Successor period, $0.5 million in the
2007 Predecessor period, and $0.8 million in 2006.

The
CDP/SERP Plan assets are invested at the option of the participant in an account
that mirrors the performance of a fund or funds selected by the Company’s
Compensation Committee or its delegate (the “Mutual Fund Options”) or, prior to
the Merger, in an account that mirrored the performance of the Company’s common
stock (the “Common Stock Option”).  Effective August 2, 2008, the deemed
fund options under the CDP/SERP Plan were changed to mirror the same fund
options offered under the 401(k) plan. A participant’s CDP and SERP account
balances will be paid in accordance with the participant’s election by (a) lump
sum, (b) monthly installments over a 5, 10 or 15 year period or (c) a
combination of lump sum and installments.  The vested amount will be
payable at the time designated by the plan upon the participant’s termination of
employment or retirement, except that participants may elect to receive an
in-service distribution or an “unforeseeable emergency hardship” distribution of
vested amounts credited to the CDP account. Account balances deemed to be
invested in the Mutual Fund Options are payable in cash and, prior to the
Merger, account balances deemed to be invested in the Common Stock Option were
payable in shares of Dollar General common stock and cash in lieu of fractional
shares.

As
a result of the Merger, the CDP/SERP Plan liabilities as of the Merger date were
fully funded into an irrevocable rabbi trust. All account balances deemed to be
invested in the Common Stock Option were liquidated at a value of $22.00 per
share and the proceeds were transferred to an existing Mutual Fund Option within
the Plan.


Asset
balances in the Mutual Funds Option are stated at fair market value, which is
based on quoted market prices. The current portion of these balances is included
in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and the long term portion is
included in Other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance
with EITF 97-14 “Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts
Earned Are Held in a Rabbi Trust and Invested,” the Company’s stock was recorded
at historical cost and included in Other shareholders’ equity, prior to the
Merger. Also, prior to the Merger, the deferred compensation liability related
to the Company stock for active plan participants was included in shareholders’
equity and subsequent changes to the fair value of the obligation were not
recognized, in accordance with the provisions of EITF 97-14. However, as a
result of the Merger, Company stock is no longer an available option to Plan
participants. The deferred compensation liability related to the Mutual Funds
Option is recorded at the fair value of the investment options as chosen by the
participants. The current portion of these balances is included in Accrued
expenses and other and the long term portion is included in Other liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets.

Through
January 2008, the Company sponsored a supplemental executive retirement plan for
the Chief Executive Officer (called the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
for David A. Perdue) and accounted for the plan in accordance with SFAS 158. As
a result of the Merger, which constituted a change in control under the terms of
this plan and the grantor trust agreement, and Mr. Perdue’s subsequent
resignation, Mr. Perdue became 100% vested. A deposit of approximately $6.2
million was made to the trust representing Mr. Perdue’s lump sum vested benefit
and accumulated interest, which amount was paid to Mr. Perdue on January 7,
2008, effectively terminating the plan.

Prior
to the Merger, non-employee directors could defer all or a part of any fees
normally paid by the Company to a voluntary nonqualified compensation deferral
plan. The compensation eligible for deferral included the annual retainer,
meeting and other fees, as well as any per diem compensation for special
assignments, earned by a director for his or her service to the Company’s Board
of Directors or one of its committees. The deferred compensation was credited to
a liability account, which was then invested at the option of the director, in
deemed investments which mirrored either the Mutual Fund Options or the Common
Stock Option and the deferred compensation was to be paid in accordance with the
director’s election. All deferred compensation was immediately due and payable
upon a “change in control” of the Company, as defined by the Plan. As a result
of the Merger, which constituted a change in control under the Plan, all
accounts held in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors were
distributed.

Share-based
payments

The
Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with SFAS 123(R).
 Under SFAS 123(R), the fair value of each award is separately estimated
and amortized into compensation expense over the service period.  The fair
value of the Company’s stock option grants are estimated on the grant date using
the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model.  The application of this
valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in
the determination of compensation expense.


The
Company adopted SFAS 123(R) effective February 4, 2006 and began recognizing
compensation expense for stock options based on the fair value of the awards on
the grant date. The Company adopted SFAS 123(R) under the
modified-prospective-transition method and, therefore, results from prior
periods have not been restated. Under SFAS 123(R), forfeitures are estimated at
the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period.

Prior
to the Merger, the Company maintained various share-based compensation programs
which included options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.  In
connection with the Merger, the Company’s outstanding stock options, restricted
stock and restricted stock units became fully vested immediately prior to the
closing of the Merger and were settled in cash, canceled or, in limited
circumstances, exchanged for new options of the Company, as described below.
 Unless exchanged for new options, each option holder received an amount in
cash, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to $22.00
less the exercise price of each in-the-money option.  Additionally, each
restricted stock and restricted stock unit holder received $22.00 in cash,
without interest and less applicable withholding taxes.  Certain stock
options held by Company management were exchanged for new options to purchase
common stock in the Company (the “Rollover Options”).  The exercise price
of the Rollover Options and the number of shares of Company common stock
underlying the Rollover Options were adjusted as a result of the Merger.
 The Rollover Options otherwise continue under the terms of the equity plan
under which the original options were issued.

On
July 6, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the 2007 Stock Incentive
Plan for Key Employees, which Plan was subsequently amended (as so amended, the
“Plan”).  The Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalent rights
to key employees, directors, consultants or other persons having a service
relationship with the Company, its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates.
 The number of shares of Company common stock authorized for grant under
the Plan is 27.5 million, 24 million of which may be granted in the form of
stock options. As of January 30, 2009, 4,154,826 of such shares are available
for future grants, including 2,913,210 shares which may be granted in the form
of stock options.

During
the 2008 and the 2007 Successor period, the Company granted options that vest
solely upon the continued employment of the recipient (“Time Options”) as well
as options that vest upon the achievement of predetermined annual or cumulative
financial-based targets (“Performance Options”).  According to the award
terms, 20% of the Time Options and Performance Options generally vest annually
over a five-year period. In the event the performance target is not achieved in
any given period, such options for that period will subsequently vest upon the
achievement of a cumulative performance target.  Vesting of the Time
Options and Performance Options is also subject to acceleration in the event of
an earlier change in control or public offering.  Each of these options,
whether Time Options or Performance Options have a contractual term of 10 years
and an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant.

Both
the Time Options and the Performance Options are subject to various provisions
set forth in a management stockholder’s agreement entered into with each option
holder by which the Company may require the employee, upon termination, to sell
to the Company any vested


options
or shares received upon exercise of the Time Options or Performance Options at
amounts that differ based upon the reason for the termination. In particular, in
the event that the employee resigns “without good reason” (as defined in the
management stockholder’s agreement), then any options whether or not then
exercisable are forfeited and any shares received upon prior exercise of such
options are callable at the Company’s option at an amount equal to the lesser of
fair value or the amount paid for the shares (i.e. the exercise price).  In
such cases, because the employee would not benefit in any share appreciation
over the exercise price, for accounting purposes, under SFAS 123(R) such options
are not considered vested until the expiration of the Company’s call option,
which is generally five years subsequent to the date of grant.
 Accordingly, all references to the vesting provisions or vested status of
the options discussed in this note give effect to the vesting pursuant to the
provisions of SFAS 123(R) and may differ from descriptions of the vesting status
of the Time Options and Performance Options located elsewhere in the Company’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Each
of the Company’s management-owned shares, Rollover Options, and vested new
options include certain provisions by which the holder of such shares, Rollover
Options, or vested new options may require the Company to repurchase such
instruments in limited circumstances.  Specifically, each such instrument
is subject to a repurchase right for a period of 365 days after termination due
to the death or disability of the holder of the instrument that occurs generally
within five years from the date of grant.  In such circumstances, the
holder of such instruments may require the Company to repurchase any shares at
the fair market value of such shares and any Rollover Options or vested new
options at a price equal to the intrinsic value of such Rollover or vested new
options.  Because the Company does not have control over the circumstances
in which it may be required to repurchase the outstanding shares or Rollover
Options, such shares and Rollover Options, valued at $9.7 million and $4.2
million, respectively, at January 30, 2009, and at $6.0 million and $3.2
million, respectively, at February 1, 2008 have been classified as Redeemable
common stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of these dates.
 The values of these equity instruments are based upon the fair value and
intrinsic value of the underlying stock and Rollover Options at the date of
issuance. Because redemption of such shares is uncertain, such shares are not
subject to re-measurement until their redemption becomes probable.

In
addition to the repurchase rights upon death or disability that are common to
all management held shares, Rollover Options, and vested new options, the
management stockholder’s agreement which the Company entered into with certain
executive officers provided such officers with an additional repurchase right in
the event their employment terminated for any reason prior to the expiration of
this repurchase right on July 21, 2008.  Such executive officers could have
required the Company to repurchase their outstanding shares and Rollover Options
at a price of $5 per share in the case of shares and the difference in $5 per
share and the exercise price of any Rollover Options that they hold.  This
repurchase right existed for a period of 365 days following termination of
employment within the required timeframe.  As noted above, each of the
shares, whether held by general members of management or executive officers, has
been classified within Redeemable common stock on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008.  In the case of
the Rollover Options held by the executive officers, however, the additional
repurchase rights in the event of termination of employment prior to
July 21, 2008 were considered within the control of


the
employee, and as such, $3.6 million (representing the fixed repurchase price)
related to such Rollover Options were classified in Other (noncurrent)
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at February 1, 2008
pursuant to SFAS 123(R).

Subsequent
to the Merger, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted an Equity Appreciation
Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”).  The Rights Plan provides for the granting
of equity appreciation rights to nonexecutive managerial employees.
 Through January 30, 2009, 1,050,674 equity appreciation rights had been
granted, 50,237 of such rights had been cancelled and 1,000,437 of such rights
remain outstanding. The vesting of such rights is based upon continued
employment and either a change in control of the Company or a qualified public
offering as defined in the Rights Plan. Through January 30, 2009, no
compensation expense related to the Rights Plan had been recognized based
primarily on the uncertainty of the vesting events.

For
the year ended January 30, 2009, the fair value method of SFAS 123(R)
resulted in share-based compensation expense and a corresponding reduction in
net income before income taxes in the amount of $10.0 million ($6.1 million net
of tax) of which $8.9 million ($5.4 million net of tax) was related to stock
options and $1.1 million ($0.7 million net of tax) was related to restricted
stock as discussed below.

The
2007 Successor statement of operations reflects share-based compensation expense
(a component of SG&A expenses) under the fair value method of SFAS 123(R)
for outstanding share-based awards and a corresponding reduction of pre-tax
income in the amount of $3.8 million ($2.4 million net of tax).

The
Company recognized $45.4 million of share-based compensation expense in the 2007
Predecessor statement of operations ($28.5 million net of tax), including $6.0
million of  compensation expense prior to the Merger included in SG&A
expenses comprised of $2.3 million for stock options and $3.7 million for
restricted stock and restricted stock units. The remaining $39.4 million of such
expense related directly to the Merger is reflected in Transaction and related
costs in the consolidated statement of operations for the Predecessor period
ended July 6, 2007, for the accelerated vesting of stock options ($18.7 million)
and restricted stock and restricted stock units ($20.7 million).

For
the year ended February 2, 2007, the fair value method of SFAS 123(R)
resulted in additional share-based compensation expense and a corresponding
reduction in net income before income taxes in the amount of $3.6 million ($2.2
million net of tax).

The
fair value of each option grant is separately estimated by applying the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing valuation model. The weighted average for
key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted in the
year ended January 30, 2009, the Successor period ended February 1, 2008, the
Predecessor period ended July 6, 2007 and the year ended February 2, 2007, and a
summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as
follows:


Expected
dividend yield - This is an estimate of the expected dividend yield on the
Company’s stock.  Prior to the Merger this estimate was based on historical
dividend payment trends. Subsequent to the Merger, the Company is subject to
limitations on the payment of dividends under its credit facilities as further
discussed in Note 6.  An increase in the dividend yield will decrease
compensation expense.

Expected
stock price volatility - This is a measure of the amount by which the price of
the Company’s common stock has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. Prior to
the Merger, the Company used actual historical changes in the market price of
the Company’s common stock and implied volatility based upon traded options,
weighted equally, to calculate the volatility assumption, as it was the
Company’s belief that this methodology provided the best indicator of future
volatility. For historical volatility, the Company calculated daily market price
changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected
life of the options to determine volatility. Subsequent to the Merger the
expected volatilities have been based upon the historical volatilities of a peer
group of four companies, as the Company’s common stock is not publicly traded.
An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Weighted
average risk-free interest rate - This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of
the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option. An
increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Expected
term of options - This is the period of time over which the options granted are
expected to remain outstanding. For options issued prior to the Merger, the
Company took into consideration that its stock option grants prior to August
2002 were significantly different than grants issued on and after that date, and
therefore that the historical and post-vesting employee behavior patterns for
grants prior to that date were of little or no value in determining future
expectations. As a result, the Company excluded these pre-August 2002 grants
from its analysis of expected term. For pre-Merger options, the Company
estimated expected term using a computation based on an assumption that
outstanding options would be exercised approximately halfway through their
contractual term, taking into consideration such factors as grant date,
expiration date, weighted-average time-to-vest, actual exercises and
post-vesting cancellations. Options granted have a maximum term of 10 years. Due
to the absence of historical data for grants issued subsequent to the Merger,
the Company has estimated the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting
date and the contractual term of the option. An increase in the expected term
will increase compensation expense.

All
nonvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted in the 2007
Successor and Predecessor periods had a purchase price of zero. The Company
records compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the restriction
period based on the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
The nonvested restricted stock and restricted


stock
unit awards granted under the plan to employees during the 2007 Predecessor
period were originally scheduled to vest and become payable ratably over a
three-year period from the respective grant dates. The nonvested restricted
stock unit awards granted under the plan to non-employee directors during the
2007 Predecessor period were originally scheduled to vest over a one-year period
from the respective grant dates, but became payable as a result of the Merger as
discussed above.

In
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R), unearned compensation is not
recorded within shareholders’ equity for nonvested restricted stock and
restricted stock unit awards. Accordingly, during the year ended February 2,
2007, the Company reversed its unearned compensation balance as of February 3,
2006 of approximately $5.2 million, with an offset to common stock and
additional paid-in capital.

At
January 30, 2009, 1,129,297 Rollover Options were outstanding, all of which were
exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding Rollover Options was
$4.8 million with a weighted average remaining contractual term of 6.44 years,
and a weighted average exercise price of $1.25. At February 1, 2008, 1,799,102
Rollover Options were outstanding, all of which were exercisable. The aggregate
intrinsic value of outstanding Rollover Options was $6.7 million with a weighted
average remaining contractual term of 7.36 years, and a weighted average
exercise price of $1.25.

During
the Predecessor period from February 3, 2007 to July 6, 2007 and year ended
February 2, 2007, the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted
was $5.37 and $5.86, respectively; 4,213,373 and 617,234 options vested, net of
forfeitures, respectively; with a total fair value of approximately $23.6
million and $2.5 million, respectively; and the total intrinsic value of stock
options exercised was $10.8 million and $6.8 million, respectively. The total
intrinsic value of stock options repurchased by the Company under terms of the
management stockholder’s agreements during 2008 and the 2007 Successor period
was $2.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

All
stock options granted prior to the Merger in the Predecessor period ended July
6, 2007 and year ended February 2, 2007 under the terms of the Company’s
pre-Merger stock incentive plan were non-qualified stock options issued at a
price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date
of grant, were originally scheduled to vest ratably over a four-year period, and
were to expire 10 years following the date of grant.

A
summary of Time Options activity during the Successor period ended January 30,
2009 is as follows:


During
2008, the weighted average grant date fair value of Time Options granted was
$2.38; 1,566,000 Time Options vested and are exercisable, net of forfeitures,
with a total fair value of approximately $4.1 million, and none of those options
were exercised.  At January 30, 2009, the aggregate intrinsic value of
outstanding 2007 Time Options was $5.3 million with a weighted average remaining
contractual term of 8.9 years. During the 2007 Successor period, the weighted
average grant date fair value of Time Options granted was $2.65; no options
vested or were exercised. At February 1, 2008, the aggregate intrinsic value of
outstanding 2007 Time Options was $0 with a weighted average remaining
contractual term of 9.6 years, and none of the outstanding Time Options were
exercisable.

A
summary of Performance Options activity during the Successor period ended
January 30, 2009 is as follows:

During
2008, the weighted average grant date fair value of Performance Options granted
was $2.38; 1,848,487 Performance Options vested and are exercisable, net of
forfeitures, with a total fair value of approximately $4.8 million, and none of
those options were exercised. At January 30, 2009, the aggregate intrinsic value
of outstanding Performance Options was $5.3 million with a weighted average
remaining contractual term of 8.9 years. During the 2007 Successor period, the
weighted average grant date fair value of Performance Options granted was $2.65;
1,907,000 Performance Options vested and are exercisable, net of forfeitures,
with a total fair value of approximately $5.1 million, and none of those options
were exercised. At February 1, 2008, the aggregate intrinsic value of
outstanding 2007 Performance Options was $0 with a weighted average remaining
contractual term of 9.6 years.

At
January 30, 2009, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
stock options was $42.9 million with an expected weighted average expense
recognition period of 3.8 years.

The
Company currently believes that the performance targets related to the
Performance Options will be achieved.  If such goals are not met, and there
is no change in control, no compensation cost relating to these Performance
Options will be recognized and any compensation cost recognized to date will be
reversed.

In
January 2008, the Company granted 890,000 nonvested restricted shares to its
Chief Executive Officer. These shares vest on the first to occur of (i) a change
in control, (ii) an initial public offering, (iii) termination without cause or
due to death or disability, or (iv) the last day of the Company’s 2011 fiscal
year. These shares represent the only outstanding restricted shares as of
January 30, 2009 and February 1, 2008. For 2008 and the 2007 Successor period,
the share-based compensation expense related to restricted shares before income

Capital
stock

On
November 29, 2006 and September 30, 2005, the Predecessor’s Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500 million and up to 10 million
shares, respectively, of the Predecessor’s outstanding common stock. These
authorizations allowed for purchases in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions from time to time, subject to market conditions. The
objective of these share repurchase initiatives was to enhance shareholder value
by purchasing shares at a price that produced a return on investment that was
greater than the Company’s cost of capital. Additionally, share repurchases
generally were undertaken only if such purchases resulted in an accretive impact
on the Company’s fully diluted earnings per share calculation.  No
purchases were made pursuant to the 2006 authorization, which was terminated as
a result of the Merger. During 2006, the Company purchased approximately 4.5
million shares of the Predecessor pursuant to the 2005 authorization at a total
cost of $79.9 million.

million charge included in Cost of goods sold related to the markdown of certain

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) or
15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management
prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all
related financial information contained in this report. This responsibility
includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

To
comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of
2002, management designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive
assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting.
Such assessment  was based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its inherent limitations, a
system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly
monitors our internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to
correct any deficiencies as they are identified. Based on its assessment,
management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is
effective as of January 30, 2009.

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP
regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not
subject to attestation by Ernst & Young LLP pursuant to temporary rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only
management’s report in this annual report.

Changes

.  There have been no
changes during the quarter ended January 30, 2009 in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have

OTHER
INFORMATION

Named Executive
Officer Base Salary Adjustments

On
March 18, 2009, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved
annual base salary increases for each of our named executive officers listed
below (the “named executive officers”), all to be effective April 1, 2009.
 Mr. Dreiling’s base salary increase was recommended by the Compensation
Committee and, on March 19, 2009, approved by the Board of Directors.

Named Executive
Officer Bonus Program

On
March 18, 2009, the Compensation Committee approved the fiscal 2009 annual bonus
program (the “2009 Teamshare Program”) applicable to the named executive
officers, among others. Mr. Dreiling’s participation in the 2009 Teamshare
Program (to the extent not otherwise required by the terms of his employment
agreement with us) was recommended by the Compensation Committee and, on March
19, 2009, approved by the Board of Directors.

Under
the 2009 Teamshare Program, the named executive officers will be eligible to
receive a cash bonus payment equal to a certain percentage of base salary based
upon the Company’s achievement in fiscal 2009 of a pre-established financial
performance measure based upon earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and
depreciation (“EBITDA”), with adjustments similar to those made for purposes of
calculating performance targets for our long-term incentive program, including
exclusions for the impact of: (a) any fee paid to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., Goldman Sachs & Co. and any affiliates thereof pursuant to the terms of
the Monitoring Fee Letter Agreement dated July 6, 2007; (b) all consulting,
accounting, legal, valuation, banking, filing, disclosure and similar costs,
fees and expenses directly related to the consideration, negotiation, approval
and consummation of the proposed acquisition and related financing of the
Company by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (including without
limitation any costs, fees and expenses relating to the filing and maintenance
of the Form S-1 market maker registration statement) and any litigation or
settlement of any litigation related thereto; (c) any costs, fees and expenses
directly related to the consideration, negotiation, and


consummation
of any public offering of our common stock or any asset sale, merger or other
transaction that results in a change-in-control of the Company; and (d) any
unplanned items of a non-recurring or extraordinary nature as determined in good
faith by the CEO and CFO and approved by the Committee.

The
Committee established a target financial performance level for purposes of the
2009 Teamshare Program at a level equal to the Company’s annual financial
objective.  The Committee also established the threshold financial
performance level, below which no bonus may be paid under the 2009 Teamshare
Program, at 95% of the target financial performance level. There is no maximum
level of EBITDA performance associated with the 2009 Teamshare Program, although
any individual payout under the Program is capped at $2.5 million.

The
Committee considers the 2009 Teamshare Program target financial performance
level to be challenging and generally consistent with the level of difficulty of
achievement associated with our performance-based awards for prior years.
 We did not achieve the threshold Teamshare performance level in fiscal
years 2006 or 2005. We achieved Teamshare performance levels between threshold
and target in fiscal year 2004, between target and maximum in fiscal year 2007,
and at maximum in fiscal year 2003. Fiscal 2008 was the first year in which we
did not associate a maximum level of EBITDA performance with the bonus program.
 For fiscal 2008, we achieved a Teamshare performance level of
approximately 218% of the target.

The
bonus payable to each named executive officer if we reach the 2009 target
financial performance level is equal to the applicable percentage, as set forth
in the chart below, of such officer’s salary:

Payments
for financial performance below or above the target level shall be prorated on a
graduated scale commensurate with performance levels in accordance with the
following schedule. As a threshold matter, unless required by contract, no such
named executive officer is eligible to receive a bonus under the 2009 Teamshare
Program if that officer receives an “unsatisfactory” overall subjective
individual performance rating and payment of any bonus is in the Committee’s
discretion if the named executive officer receives a “needs improvement” overall
individual performance rating.

Procedures
for Shareholders to Nominate Directors; Arrangements to Serve as Directors.

All of our directors are managers of Buck Holdings, LLC which serves as
the general partner of Buck Holdings, L.P.  The Second Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement of Buck Holdings, LLC generally requires
that the members of Buck Holdings, LLC


take
all necessary action to ensure that the persons who serve as its managers also
serve on our Board. In addition, Mr. Dreiling’s employment agreement
provides that he will continue to serve as a member of our Board as long as he
remains our Chief Executive Officer.

Because
of these requirements, together with Buck Holdings’ controlling ownership of our
outstanding common stock, we do not have a policy or procedures with respect to
shareholder recommendations for nominees to our Board.

(c)

Audit
Committee Financial Expert.

Our Audit Committee is composed of
Messrs. Calbert and Agrawal. As a closely held company and in the absence of a
public trading market for our common stock, our Board has not designated any
member of the Audit Committee as an “audit committee financial expert.” Though
not formally considered by our Board given that our securities are not
registered or traded on any national securities exchange, we do not believe that
Messrs. Calbert or Agrawal would be considered independent because of their
relationships with KKR which indirectly owns, through its interests in Parent, a
substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock, and certain other
relationships with us as more fully described under Item 13 below.

(d)

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics.

We have adopted a Code of Business

officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, on
www.dollargeneral.com promptly following the amendment or waiver.  We may
elect to disclose any such amendment or waiver in a report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC either in addition to or in lieu of the website disclosure. The

We refer to the persons included in
the Summary Compensation Table below as our “named executive officers”.
References to “2008,” “2007,” and “2006” mean, respectively, our fiscal years
ended January 30, 2009, February 1, 2008 and February 2, 2007. References to the
“Merger” mean our merger, discussed more fully elsewhere in this document, that
occurred on July 6, 2007 as a result of which we became a subsidiary of Buck
Holdings, L.P. (“Buck” or “Parent”), a Delaware limited partnership controlled
by investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P.
(“KKR” or “Sponsor”).


Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Executive
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

We
strive to attract, retain and motivate persons with superior ability, to reward
outstanding performance, and to align the interests of our named executive
officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The material
compensation principles applicable to the 2008 compensation of our named
executive officers included the following, all of which are discussed in more
detail in “Elements of 2008 Named Executive Officer Compensation” below:

·

We
generally target total compensation at the benchmarked median of our market
comparator group, but we make adjustments based on circumstances, such as unique
job descriptions and our particular niche in the retail sector, that are not
reflected in the market data. For competitive reasons, our levels of total
compensation or any component of compensation may exceed the median of our
comparator group.

·

We
set base salaries to reflect the responsibilities, experience and contributions
of the named executive officers and the salaries for comparable benchmarked
positions, subject to minimums set forth in employment agreements.

·

We
reward named executive officers who enhance our performance by linking cash and
equity incentives to the achievement of our financial goals.

·

We
promote share ownership to align the interests of our named executive officers
with those of our shareholders.

The
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors utilizes employment agreements
with the named executive officers which, among other things, set forth minimum
levels of certain compensation components. The Committee believes such
arrangements are a common protection offered to named executive officers at
comparable companies, and help ensure continuity and aid in retention. The
agreements also provide for standard protections to both the officer and to
Dollar General should the officer’s employment terminate.

Named Executive
Officer Compensation Process

Oversight

.
 The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for
recommending CEO compensation to our Board and for approving compensation of
other named executive officers. The Board retains sole authority to determine
CEO compensation. The Committee members include Messrs. Calbert, Agrawal and
Jones.

Use
of Outside Advisors

.  Prior to the Merger, the former Compensation
Committee selected Hewitt Associates as its compensation consultant and approved
a written agreement with Hewitt which describes the general terms of the working
relationship.  Hewitt remains a consultant to the Company subsequent to the
Merger, and while the written agreement with Hewitt has not been formally
renewed, we continue to operate consistent with its terms.


The
written agreement with Hewitt specifies that Hewitt may perform compensation
consulting services upon management or Committee request, which services may
include competitive market pay analyses, support regarding legal, regulatory or
accounting considerations impacting compensation programs, redesign of those
programs, assistance with market data, trends and competitive practices, meeting
preparation and attendance and other miscellaneous work.

While
the Committee or any of its members may consult directly with Hewitt should it
or they choose to do so, subsequent to the Merger Hewitt has directly dealt
solely with Mr. Dreiling, Ms. Challis Lowe (while she served as our EVP of Human
Resources) and Mr. Robert Ravener (since he became our SVP and Chief People
Officer) (Ms. Lowe or Mr. Ravener, during the applicable time period, our
“Senior HR Officer”), as well as with non-executive members of our human
resources group, both with respect to management’s work in connection with named
executive officer compensation (as described below under “Management’s Role”)
and in connection with general employee compensation and benefits matters. Our
Committee Chairman, Mr. Calbert, reviews with Mr. Dreiling and our Senior HR
Officer information provided by Hewitt, along with Mr. Dreiling’s and our Senior
HR Officer’s executive compensation recommendations.

Management’s
Role

. Mr. Dreiling and the Senior HR Officer, along with non-executive
members of the human resources group, assist Hewitt in gathering and analyzing
relevant competitive data and identifying and evaluating various alternatives
for named executive officer compensation (including their own). Mr. Dreiling and
the Senior HR Officer regularly provide and discuss their recommendations
regarding named executive officer pay components, typically based on Hewitt
benchmarking data, to the Compensation Committee Chairman between Committee
meetings and to the full Committee at Committee meetings. Mr. Dreiling assesses
named executive officer performance (with Mr. Bere’s assistance with respect to
fiscal 2007 performance) for purposes of determining whether each named
executive officer is eligible, as a threshold matter, for a base salary increase
and for a Teamshare bonus payout in the event the relevant EBITDA performance
level is achieved (each as discussed more fully below under “Elements of 2008
Named Executive Officer Compensation”).

While
the Board and the Committee members valued and welcomed such input from
management, the Board and the Committee ultimately made all 2008 named executive
officer compensation decisions.

Use
of Market Benchmarking Data

.  To attract and retain named executive
officers who we believe will enhance our long-term business results, we must pay
compensation that is competitive with the external market for executive talent.
We believe that this primary talent market consists of retail companies with
revenues and business models similar to ours because those companies have
executive positions similar in breadth, complexity and scope of responsibility
to our named executive officer positions. For 2008, Hewitt provided data to
management regarding total and individual compensation elements from its
proprietary salary survey database and from the proxy statements of selected
retail companies that met these criteria. We refer to this combined group as the
market comparator group. In 2008, this group consisted of Advance Auto Parts,
AutoZone, Big Lots, Family Dollar, Kohl’s, Limited Brands,


Longs
Drug Stores, Nordstrom, OfficeMax, Payless Shoe Source, Retail Ventures,
Staples, J.C. Penney, The Gap, Macy’s, Blockbuster, The Pantry, Ross Stores, and
SuperValu Inc.

Hewitt was also asked to provide
summary market data from all of the retail companies in their data base and from
the proxy statement information for certain other significantly larger retail
companies (Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreen’s and CVS) as additional reference points
in assessing the appropriateness of the compensation levels of our named
executive officers.

For
2009 compensation decisions, the same market comparator group of nineteen
companies was used except for five companies (Advance Auto Parts, Kohl’s,
Limited Brands, Retail Ventures and SuperValu) that discontinued their
participation in the Hewitt study.  These companies were replaced by
7-Eleven, Genuine Parts, McDonald’s, PetsMart, and Yum Brands which were chosen
due to their relative comparability to the companies in the existing market
comparator group.

The
Committee believes that the median range of the competitive market generally is
the appropriate target for a named executive officer’s total compensation, and
the Committee takes into account the value of the named executive officer’s
long-term compensation when determining the levels of the cash compensation
components.  The Committee recognizes, however, that it is difficult to
compare equity granted by a private company to equity granted by a public
company because of liquidity and other comparability issues.  In addition,
the Committee does not make annual equity grants to the named executive
officers, as it believes that the long-term equity previously granted to the
named executive officers in fiscal 2007 or at the time they were employed, as
applicable, is sufficiently retentive and otherwise adequately meets our
compensation objectives as discussed under “Long-Term Incentive Program” below.

Elements of 2008
Named Executive Officer Compensation

We
provide compensation in the form of base salary, short-term cash incentives,
long-term equity incentives, benefits and perquisites. As discussed in more
detail below, the Compensation Committee believes that each of these elements is
a necessary component of the compensation package and is consistent with
compensation programs at competing companies.

Base
Salary.

Base salary generally promotes the recruiting and
retention functions of our compensation principles by reflecting the salaries
for comparable positions in the competitive marketplace and by providing a
stable and predictable source of income for our executives. The Committee
believes that we would be unable to attract or retain quality named executive
officers in the absence of competitive base salary levels. For this reason, base
salary constitutes a significant portion of a named executive officer’s total
compensation. Base salary also furthers the pay for performance role of our
philosophy because, as a threshold matter, a named executive officer is not
eligible for a salary increase unless he or she achieves a satisfactory overall
subjective performance evaluation.

Following
fiscal 2007, Mr. Dreiling (with input from Mr. Bere) subjectively assessed each
named executive officer in the context of that officer’s job responsibilities
and made a determination as to whether that officer’s performance for fiscal
2007 was satisfactory or unsatisfactory on an overall basis.  A
determination of unsatisfactory performance would have


precluded
that named executive officer from receiving an increase in 2008 base salary.
 A threshold determination of satisfactory performance did not by itself
result in any variation in a named executive officer’s compensation.
 Rather, satisfactory performance merely created the possibility of an
increase in base salary.  Once a named executive officer’ eligibility was
established, the magnitude of any salary increase was determined on the basis of
benchmarking information from Hewitt regarding the compensation and role of each
named executive officer within our management structure in comparison to the
compensation that companies in our market comparator group provide to similarly
situated executives. Because Mr. Dreiling determined that each such person
performed satisfactorily overall, as a threshold matter each named executive
officer was eligible to be considered for a 2008 salary increase.

In
determining each named executive officer’s 2008 base salary, the Compensation
Committee reviewed the composition of the market comparator group, as described
above, and Ms. Lowe informed the Compensation Committee of the results of the
benchmarking analysis, which had been discussed in detail separately with the
Committee’s chairman. This benchmarking data showed that there was significant
movement in the market median for Ms. Guion’s position and, as a result, the
Committee adjusted her pay accordingly which resulted in an approximate 15.5%
base salary increase. The Committee approved 3% base salary increases for all
other named executive officers (other than Mr. Dreiling, who was not considered
for an increase given his recent hiring in January 2008) in order to maintain
base salaries within the median range of the market comparator group.

Subsequent
to the fiscal 2008 year end but prior to the filing of this document, the
Compensation Committee considered the 2009 base salary increases for each named
executive officer. Mr. Dreiling advised the Committee that he had subjectively
assessed the overall performance of each named executive officer and determined
that each had performed the duties and responsibilities of his or her respective
position in a satisfactory manner.  As in prior years, a determination of
unsatisfactory performance would have precluded that named executive officer
from receiving an increase in base salary, and the threshold determination of
satisfactory performance did not by itself result in any variation in
compensation.  Rather, satisfactory performance merely created the
possibility of an increase in base salary. The magnitude of the salary increase
was determined on the basis of benchmarking information from Hewitt regarding
data from our market comparator group.

After
reviewing a summary of the Hewitt data, the Committee determined that a 2.25%
increase in base salary for each named executive officer (other than Mr.
Dreiling and Ms Lanigan) was within the competitive median range of base salary
increases within the market comparator group.  The benchmarking data showed
that there was additional movement in the market median for Ms. Lanigan’s
position and, as a result, the Committee adjusted her pay accordingly which
resulted in an approximate 5% base salary increase.  All such increases are
effective April 1, 2009.

The
Committee also met with Mr. Dreiling privately to subjectively review his
performance in fiscal 2008 in the context of his job responsibilities.  The
Committee determined that Mr. Dreiling’s fiscal 2008 performance was
satisfactory on an overall basis, thus also qualifying him for a 2009 base
salary increase.  As with other named executive officers, such
determination did not by itself result in any variation in Mr. Dreiling’s
compensation, but rather


merely
created the possibility of a base salary increase.  Based on the same
Hewitt market data reviewed for the other named executive officers, the
Committee recommended, and the non-management members of the Board of Directors
approved, a 12.1% base salary increase for Mr. Dreiling, effective April 1,
2009, in order to maintain his base salary within the median range of the market
comparator group.

Short-Term
Incentive Plan.

Our short-term incentive plan, called Teamshare,
serves to motivate named executive officers to achieve certain pre-established,
objective financial goals. As a threshold matter, unless required by contract, a
named executive officer is not eligible to receive a bonus under the 2008
Teamshare program if that officer receives an “unsatisfactory” overall
subjective individual performance rating, and payment of any bonus is in the
Compensation Committee’s discretion if the officer receives a “needs
improvement” overall individual performance rating. Accordingly, Teamshare
fulfills an important part of our pay for performance philosophy while aligning
the interests of our named executive officers and our shareholders. Teamshare
also helps meet our recruiting and retention objectives by providing
compensation opportunities that are consistent with those prevalent in our
market comparator group.

(a)

2008 Teamshare Structure

.  Teamshare provides an opportunity
for each named executive officer to receive a cash bonus payment equal to a
certain percentage of base salary based upon Dollar General’s achievement of a
pre-established financial performance measure. As it did in 2007, the
Compensation Committee selected as the 2008 Teamshare financial performance
measure a measure based upon earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”), with adjustments similar to those made for the purposes
of calculating performance targets for our long term incentive program,
including exclusions for the impact of:

·

any
fee paid to KKR, Goldman Sachs & Co. and any affiliates thereof pursuant to
the terms of the Monitoring Fee Letter Agreement dated July 6, 2007;

·

all
consulting, accounting, legal, valuation, banking, filing, disclosure and
similar costs, fees and expenses directly related to the consideration,
negotiation, approval and consummation of the Merger and related financing and
any related litigation or settlement of any related litigation; and

·

any
unplanned items of a non-recurring or extraordinary nature as determined in good
faith by the CEO and CFO and approved by the Committee.

The
Committee established the target financial performance level for purposes of the
2008 Teamshare program at $815 million, which, consistent with prior practice,
was equal to our annual financial objective. It also was similar to the fiscal
2008 level for vesting of performance-based options granted on July 6, 2007 to
the named executive officers. The Committee established the threshold financial
performance level, below which no bonus may be paid under the 2008 Teamshare
program, at 95% of the target financial performance level. This differed from
prior practice which established the threshold level at 90% of the target level
as the


Committee
believed that a threshold level of 95% of target was more consistent with other
companies within the KKR portfolio.

Unlike
the Teamshare program in prior years, there was no maximum level of EBITDA
performance associated with the 2008 Teamshare program. The Committee felt that
setting a maximum EBITDA performance level could discourage employees to strive
to achieve EBITDA results beyond the maximum level.

The
Committee considered the 2008 Teamshare program target financial performance
level to be challenging and generally consistent with the level of difficulty of
achievement associated with the our performance-based awards for prior years.
 We did not achieve the threshold Teamshare performance level in fiscal
years 2006 or 2005. We achieved Teamshare performance levels between threshold
and target in fiscal years 2004 and 2002, between target and maximum in fiscal
year 2007, and at maximum in fiscal year 2003.

The
bonus payable to each named executive officer if Dollar General reached the 2008
target financial performance level was equal to the applicable percentage of
each officer’s salary as set forth in the chart below. Such payout levels, which
are consistent with prior years’ payout levels, were selected because they are
within the median range of the Hewitt data for the market comparator group.


Payments
for financial performance below or above the target level are prorated on a
graduated scale commensurate with performance levels in accordance with the
following schedule.

This
pro ration schedule, through 110% of the target EBITDA performance level (the
prior maximum EBITDA performance level), is consistent with the pro ration
schedule in prior years.  The Committee determined that the pro ration
schedule for EBITDA performance above 110% of target should approximate a
sharing between Dollar General and the Teamshare participants of 20% of the
EBITDA dollars earned above that level.  When calculated against the total
incentive dollars that would be paid at 110% of the target EBITDA performance
level, the incremental incentive payout equated to an additional 7.1491% of each
named executive officer’s bonus target for each additional 1% of EBITDA earned
above 110% of the target level.

(b)

2008 Teamshare Results

.   Following fiscal 2008, Mr.
Dreiling assessed each named executive officer in the context of that officer’s
job responsibilities and made a subjective determination as to whether that
officer’s performance for fiscal 2008 was satisfactory or unsatisfactory on an
overall basis.  A determination of unsatisfactory performance would have
precluded that named executive officer from receiving a Teamshare payout for
2008 performance (unless otherwise contractually provided) regardless of whether
we achieved our overall, objective EBITDA performance target for fiscal 2008.
 A threshold determination of satisfactory performance did not by itself
result in any variation in the named executive officer’s incentive compensation.
 Rather, satisfactory performance merely created the possibility of a
payout under the Teamshare program.  Once a named executive officer’s
eligibility was established, the Teamshare payout was determined based upon our
objective EBITDA performance.  Because Mr. Dreiling determined that each
such person performed satisfactorily


overall,
as a threshold matter each named executive officer was eligible to receive a
2008 Teamshare payout to the extent we achieved the relevant EBITDA performance
level.

The
Committee also subjectively reviewed Mr. Dreiling’s individual performance for
2008 in a manner similar to Mr. Dreiling’s evaluations of the other named
executive officers discussed above.  The Committee determined that he had
performed satisfactorily and as a threshold matter, he was therefore also
eligible to receive a 2008 Teamshare payout to the extent we achieved the
relevant EBITDA performance level.

In
March 2009, the Compensation Committee approved the EBITDA performance level at
217.63% of target. Accordingly, Teamshare payouts in the amount reflected in the
“Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation
Table will be made to each named executive officer (other than Mr. Buley and Ms.
Lowe who are no longer employed by Dollar General) at the following percentages
of base salary:  Mr. Dreiling, 217.63%; Mr. Bere, 177.73%; Mr. Tehle,
141.46%; Ms. Guion, 141.46%; and Ms. Lanigan, 141.46%.

(c)

Teamshare Structure

. As it did in 2008, the Compensation Committee selected
as the 2009 Teamshare financial performance measure a measure based upon
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), with
adjustments similar to those described above pertaining to the 2008 Teamshare
structure. The Committee established the target financial performance level for
purposes of the 2009 Teamshare program at a level equal to our annual financial
objective, which was consistent with past practice. The Committee considers the
2009 Teamshare program target financial performance level to be challenging and
generally consistent with the level of difficulty of achievement associated with
the our performance-based awards for prior years (see “2008 Teamshare Structure”
above for a discussion of the level of achievement in recent years of the
financial performance targets).

As
in 2008 and for the same reasons identified under “2008 Teamshare Structure”
above, the Committee established the threshold financial performance level,
below which no bonus may be paid under the 2009 Teamshare program, at 95% of the
target financial performance level, and the Committee did not establish a
maximum level of EBITDA performance under the 2009 Teamshare program.

The
bonus payable to each named executive officer if Dollar General reaches the 2009
target financial performance level is equal to the applicable percentage of each
officer’s salary as set forth in the chart below. Such payout levels, which are
consistent with prior years’ payout levels, were selected because they are
within the median range of the Hewitt data for the market comparator group.


Payments
for financial performance below or above the target level are prorated on the
same graduated scale commensurate with performance levels as described under
“2008 Teamshare Structure” above, except that for every 1% EBITDA increase over
110% of target, each named executive officer is eligible to receive an
additional 9.14% of his or her bonus target.

Long-Term
Incentive Program.

Long-term equity incentives motivate named
executive officers to focus on long-term success for shareholders. These
incentives provide a balance between short-term and long-term goals and are also
important to our compensation program’s recruiting and retention objectives
because most of the companies in our market comparator group offer them.
 Our long-term incentives are designed to compensate named executive
officers for a long-term commitment to us, while motivating sustained increases
in our financial performance.  We believe that our long-term equity
incentive program provides significant motivation and retention value to us for
many reasons, most notably:

·

Due
to limitations on transferability until the occurrence of certain liquidity
events, an investment in our common stock generally is illiquid while the
executive remains employed by us. If an executive’s employment with us
terminates, we may generally compel him or her to sell that stock back to us for
a price determined in accordance with the Management Stockholder’s Agreement
between us and that executive.

·

Half
of all option awards are time-based and vest over a five-year period, provided
the executive continues to be employed by us.  The other half are intended
to be performance-based and generally require that Dollar General achieve
specified financial targets before those options will vest. These terms are
further discussed below.

Equity
awards are made under our Board-adopted and shareholder-approved 2007 Stock
Incentive Plan for Key Employees (the “2007 Plan”).  Under the current
equity award program, a personal financial investment in Dollar General is a
prerequisite to eligibility to receive an option grant under the 2007 Plan. In
2007, that personal investment could be made in the form of cash, rollover of
stock and/or rollover of in-the-money options issued prior to the Merger. Each
named executive officer (other than Mr. Dreiling who joined us in 2008 and is
discussed separately below) met the personal investment requirement and,
accordingly, received option grants in 2007 under the 2007 Plan. Because the
named executive officers received options in 2007, they were not granted any
further options in 2008 and are not expected to receive additional options in
2009 absent a job promotion or other special circumstance.


The
options granted under the 2007 Plan are divided so that half are time-vested and
half are performance-vested based on a comparison of an EBITDA-based performance
metric, as described below, against pre-set goals for that performance metric.
The combination of time and performance based vesting of these awards is
designed to compensate executives for long-term commitment to us, while
motivating sustained increases in our financial performance. The options have an
exercise price of $5 per share, which was the fair market value on the grant
date as determined by our Board of Directors.

The
time-vested options vest and become exercisable ratably on each of the five
anniversary dates of July 6, 2007 solely based upon continued employment with us
over that time period. The performance-vested options are eligible to vest and
become exercisable ratably if the Board determines in good faith that we achieve
specified annual performance targets based on EBITDA and adjusted as described
below. For fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 that target was $700 million and $828
million, respectively, which targets were based on the long-term financial plan
at the time of the Merger and anticipated permitted adjustments, primarily to
account for unique expenses related to the Merger.  If a performance target
for a given fiscal year is not met, the performance-based options may still vest
and become exercisable on a “catch up” basis if, at the end of a subsequent
fiscal year through fiscal 2012, a specified cumulative EBITDA-based performance
target is achieved. Because the performance targets are based on our long-term
financial plan, we believe these levels, while attainable, require strong
performance and execution.

For
purposes of calculating the achievement of performance targets for our long-term
incentive program, “EBITDA” means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization plus transaction, management and/or similar fees paid to KKR
and/or its affiliates. In addition, the Board is required to fairly and
appropriately adjust the calculation of EBITDA to reflect, to the extent not
contemplated in our financial plan, the following: acquisitions, divestitures,
any change required by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
relating to share-based compensation or for other changes in GAAP promulgated by
accounting standard setters that, in each case, the Board in good faith
determines require adjustment to the EBITDA performance metric we use for our
long-term incentive program. Adjustments to EBITDA for purposes of calculating
performance targets or our long-term incentive program may not in all
circumstances be identical to adjustments to EBITDA for other purposes,
including our Teamshare targets and the covenants contained in our principal
financial agreements. Accordingly, comparability of such measures is
limited.

The
specified adjusted EBITDA performance targets were achieved for both fiscal 2007
and fiscal 2008.

Benefits
and Perquisites.

We provide benefits and limited perquisites to
named executive officers for retention and recruiting purposes, to promote tax
efficiency for such persons, and to replace benefit opportunities lost due to
regulatory limits. We also provide named executive officers with benefits and
perquisites as additional forms of compensation that are believed to be
consistent and competitive with benefits and perquisites provided to similar
positions in our market comparator group and our industry. Most of the
perquisites were established prior to the Merger by the former Compensation
Committee, which believed these benefits and perquisites


help
to attract and retain executive talent. Along with certain benefits offered to
named executive officers on the same terms that are offered to all of our
salaried employees (such as health and welfare benefits and matching
contributions under our 401(k) plan), we provide such persons with certain
additional benefits and perquisites.

The
named executive officers have the opportunity to participate in the Compensation
Deferral Plan (the “CDP”) and the defined contribution Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (the “SERP”, and together with the CDP, the “CDP/SERP Plan”).
Our Compensation Committee determined in 2008 to no longer offer SERP
participation to persons to whom employment offers are made after May 28, 2008,
including newly hired executive officers.

We
provide each named executive officer a life insurance benefit equal to 2.5 times
his or her base salary up to a maximum of $3 million. We pay the premiums and
gross up such person’s income to pay the tax cost of this benefit. We also
provide each named executive officer a disability insurance benefit that
provides income replacement of 60% of base salary up to a maximum monthly
benefit of $20,000. We pay the cost of this benefit and gross up such officer’s
income to pay the tax cost of the premiums of this benefit to the extent
necessary to provide benefits comparable to the group plan applicable to all
salaried employees.

Each
named executive officer may choose either a leased automobile (for which we pay
for gasoline, repairs, service and insurance) or a fixed monthly automobile
allowance. We provide a gross-up payment to pay the tax cost of the imputed
income for both programs.  Since the Compensation Committee believes that
executive automobile programs are no longer typical in the competitive retail
market, the Committee determined in 2008 to no longer offer an automobile lease
or allowance program to persons to whom employment offers are made after May 28,
2008, including newly hired executive officers, and terminated the program for
existing named executive officers as of July 6, 2009.

We
also provide a relocation assistance program to named executive officers under a
policy applicable to officer-level employees, which policy is similar to that
offered to certain other employees. In 2008, we incurred relocation expenses for
Mr. Dreiling in accordance with this policy and his employment agreement (as
discussed below in “Compensation of Mr. Dreiling”) and for Mr. Bere in
accordance with the policy.  The significant differences between the
relocation assistance available to officers from the relocation assistance
available to non-officers are as follows:

·

We
provide a pre-move allowance of 5% of the officer’s annual base salary (we cap
this allowance at $5,000 for other employees);

·

We
provide home sale assistance by offering to purchase the officer’s prior home at
an independently determined appraised value in the event the prior home is not
sold to an outside buyer (we do not offer this service to other employees);


·

We
reimburse officers for all reasonable and customary home purchase closing costs
(we limit our reimbursement to other employees to 2% of the purchase price to a
maximum of $2,500) except for loan origination fees which are limited to 1%;
and

·

We
provide 60 days of temporary living expenses (we limit temporary living expenses
to 30 days for all other employees).

Compensation of
Mr. Dreiling

Mr.
Dreiling entered into a five-year employment agreement to become CEO and a
member of our Board effective January 21, 2008.  Key compensatory
provisions of the agreement include:

·

Minimum
annual base salary of $1,000,000.

·

Annual
bonus payout range of 50% (threshold), 100% (target) and up to no less than 200%
(maximum) of base salary based upon EBITDA performance.  For 2008, Mr.
Dreiling was guaranteed to earn at least a threshold level bonus.

·

A
signing bonus of $2,000,000.

·

Equity
grants consisting of 890,000 shares of restricted stock and options to purchase
2.5 million shares of Dollar General at $5 per share (the fair market value on
the grant date). The restricted stock is scheduled to vest upon the earlier to
occur of the last day of fiscal 2011, a change in control, an initial public
offering, termination without cause or due to death or disability, or
resignation with good reason. Half of the options are time-vested and the other
half are performance-vested. These options vest upon the same terms as the other
options that have been granted under the 2007 Plan.

·

Payment
of the premiums on his personal long-term disability insurance policies.

·

Use
of our plane for Mr. Dreiling and his spouse for up to nine trips per year
between our headquarters and his second home in California.

·

Reimbursement
and gross-up for taxes of all closing costs and expenses, including broker’s
fees, loan origination and/or loan discount fees (not to exceed 2 points in
total), and attorney fees incurred to purchase a residence in the Nashville,
Tennessee area and for up to 2 months’ lease cancellation on his apartment in
the New York metropolitan area.  Reimbursement and/or payment of and
gross-up for taxes of temporary living expenses for 120 days as well as 2 house
hunting trips not to exceed 7 nights/8 days. Relocation also includes the
payment of packing, loading, transporting, storing and delivering his household
goods including the movement of 1 car and a miscellaneous expense allowance
equal to $50,000 less applicable taxes.

·

Reimbursement
of legal fees up to $35,000, grossed-up for taxes, incurred in negotiating and
preparing the employment agreement and documents associated with Mr. Dreiling’s
equity grants.

·

Payment
of monthly membership fees and costs related to his membership in professional
clubs selected by him, grossed-up for any taxes.

Mr.
Dreiling was chosen for the CEO position after a lengthy and careful search. The
Board firmly believes he is the right leader for the Company as we move forward.
 The terms of his employment agreement summarized above were settled after
negotiation with Mr. Dreiling,


and
the Board believes that they are fair and appropriate given CEO compensation and
benefits at comparable companies and given Mr. Dreiling’s experience and
leadership ability.  These arrangements were also necessary to entice Mr.
Dreiling to resign from his previous employer and to give him the opportunity to
offset the potential financial gain he would be foregoing by leaving that
employer.

Severance
Agreements

As
noted above, we have an employment agreement with each of our named executive
officers that among other things provide for such officer’s rights upon a
termination of employment. We believe that reasonable severance benefits are
appropriate to protect the named executive officer against circumstances over
which he or she does not have control and as consideration for the promises of
non-competition, non-solicitation and non-interference that we require in our
employment agreements.

All
of our severance provisions in the event of a change-in-control operate under a
double trigger, requiring both a change-in-control and a termination event,
except for the provisions related to long-term equity incentives under our 2007
Plan.  Under the 2007 Plan, (1) all time-vested options will vest and
become immediately exercisable as to 100% of the shares of common stock subject
to such options immediately prior to a change-in-control and (2) all
performance–vested options will vest and become immediately exercisable as to
100% of the shares of common stock subject to such options immediately prior to
a change-in-control if, as a result of the change–in-control,
(x) investment funds affiliated with KKR realize a specified internal rate
of return on 100% of their aggregate investment, directly or indirectly, in our
equity securities (the “Sponsor Shares”)

and

(y) the investment
funds affiliated with KKR earn a specified cash return on 100% of the Sponsor
Shares; provided, however, that in the event that a change-in-control occurs in
which more than 50% but less than 100% of our common stock or other voting
securities or the common stock or other voting securities of Buck Holdings, L.P.
is sold or otherwise disposed of, then the performance-vested options will
become vested up to the same percentage of Sponsor Shares on which investment
funds affiliated with KKR achieve a specified internal rate of return on their
aggregate investment and earn a specified return on their Sponsor Shares.

Payments to Mr.
Buley and Ms. Lowe in Connection with Employment Separation

Mr.
Buley’s and Ms. Lowe’s employment with us ended in April 2008 and September
2008, respectively. Payments and other benefits to Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe in
connection with these employment terminations are itemized under “Potential
Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control” below and generally were in
accordance with the terms of their employment agreements.  In recognition
of her service to Dollar General, we transferred to Ms. Lowe title to her
Company-leased automobile in connection with her separation from our employment.
In addition, we extended health insurance coverage benefits to Ms. Lowe and her
eligible dependents from the date of her employment termination through December
31, 2008. Ms. Lowe bore the entire cost of this coverage extension.


Considerations
Associated with Regulatory Requirements

Section 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”),
disallows a Federal income tax deduction to publicly held companies for
compensation paid to specified executive officers to the extent that
compensation exceeds $1 million per covered officer in any fiscal year. This
limitation applies only to compensation that is not considered
performance-based. Because our common stock is not publicly traded,
Section 162(m) will not limit the tax deductibility of any executive
compensation for 2008.

The
Compensation Committee administers our compensation programs with the good faith
intention of complying with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code,
which relates to the taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation
arrangements.

Compensation Committee Report

Our
Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation
S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on such review and discussions,
the Compensation Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this document.

This
report has been furnished by:

·

Michael
M. Calbert, Chairman

·

Raj
Agrawal

·

Adrian
Jones

This
Compensation Committee Report is deemed furnished, not filed, in this document
and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act as a result of furnishing the Compensation
Committee Report in this manner.


Summary Compensation Table

The
following table summarizes compensation paid to or earned by our named executive
officers in each of fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. We have omitted
from this table the column for Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Earnings as no amounts are required to be reported in such column
for any named executive officer.

(1)

Mr.
Dreiling was hired on January 21, 2008.  Mr. Bere joined the Company in
December 2006. Ms. Lanigan joined the Company in July 2002, but was not a named
executive officer in fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006.  Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe
separated from the Company on April 15, 2008 and September 15, 2008,
respectively.

(2)

All
named executive officers deferred a portion of their fiscal 2008 salaries under
the CDP. The amounts of such deferrals are included in the Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Table. All named executive officers also contributed a portion of
their fiscal 2008 salary to our 401(k) Plan. All named executive officers (other
than Mr. Dreiling) for which fiscal 2007 salaries are reported in this column
deferred a portion of their fiscal 2007 salaries under the CDP and contributed a
portion of their salaries to our 401(k) Plan.  All named executive officers
for which fiscal 2006 salaries are reported in this column deferred a portion of
their fiscal 2006 salaries under the CDP and contributed a portion of their
salaries to our 401(k) Plan.

(3)

The
2007 amount for Mr. Dreiling represents the signing bonus paid pursuant to his
employment agreement.  The 2006 amounts represent a one-time discretionary
bonus awarded to these named executive officers for fiscal 2006.

(4)

Represents
the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with
respect to the fiscal year in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 123(R) (“SFAS 123(R)”), but disregarding the estimate of forfeitures
related to service-based vesting conditions, for outstanding awards of
restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”).  Prior to the Merger,
the expense was recorded on a straight-line basis over the restriction period
based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. There were
no forfeitures of restricted stock or RSUs held by the named executive officers
during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. For more information regarding
the assumptions used in the valuation of these awards, see Note 10 of the
annual consolidated financial statements included in this document. As a result
of the Merger, all restricted stock and RSU awards outstanding immediately
before the Merger vested


and,
therefore, all remaining compensation expense associated with those awards was
recognized in fiscal 2007 in accordance with SFAS 123(R).

(5)

Represents
the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with
respect to the fiscal year in accordance with SFAS 123(R), but disregarding the
estimate of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions, for stock
options. Option awards were valued under the fair value method of SFAS 123(R)
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

For
more information regarding the assumptions used in the valuation of these
awards, see Note 10 of the annual consolidated financial statements included in
this document.  As a result of the Merger, all options outstanding
immediately before the Merger vested and, therefore, all compensation expense
associated with those awards was recognized in fiscal 2007 in accordance with
SFAS 123(R). In connection with their employment separations, Mr. Buley and Ms.
Lowe had 787,500 and 540,000 options, respectively, that were forfeited in
fiscal 2008 and, as a result of those forfeitures, certain previously recorded
expenses related to these options were reversed.  Mr.

Tehle and Ms. Guion had 63,000 and 50,300 options,
respectively, that were forfeited in fiscal 2007 as a result of the Merger.
 There were no forfeitures of options held by named executive officers in
fiscal 2006.

(6)

Represents
amounts earned pursuant to our Teamshare bonus program for fiscal 2008 and
fiscal 2007.  See the discussion of the “Short-Term Incentive Plan” in
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above.  The 2007 amount reported for
Mr. Dreiling represents a prorated payment for the number of days worked in
fiscal 2007.  Mr. Bere and Ms. Guion each deferred 5% of his or her fiscal
2008 bonus payments under the CDP. Messrs. Bere and Buley and Ms. Guion deferred
5%, 20% and 5%, respectively, of their fiscal 2007 bonus payments under the CDP.
No amounts were earned under our Teamshare bonus program for fiscal 2006 because
we did not meet the financial performance level required for a payout.

(7)

Includes
$45,840 for tax reimbursements related to relocation, $26,200 for tax
reimbursements related to our payment of certain legal expenses, $7,832 for tax
reimbursements related to life and disability insurance premiums,  $5,183
for premiums paid under Mr. Dreiling’s existing portable long-term disability
policies, $4,167 for our match contributions to the CDP, $3,824 for premiums
paid under our life and disability insurance programs, and $249,599 which
represents the aggregate incremental cost of providing certain perquisites,
including $114,647 for costs associated with personal airplane usage, $76,641
for costs associated with relocation, $33,706 for reimbursement of legal
expenses incurred in connection with negotiating his employment agreement with
us, $21,000 for an annual automobile allowance, and other amounts which
individually did not equal the greater of $25,000 or 10% of total perquisites,
including a decorative plaque, expenses related to attendance at entertainment
events, and a racing scanner/headset.  The aggregate incremental cost
related to the personal airplane usage was calculated using costs we would not
have incurred but for the usage (including costs incurred as a result of
“deadhead” legs of personal flights), including fuel costs, maintenance costs,
engine restoration/reserve fees, crew expenses, landing, parking and other
associated fees, and supplies and catering costs. The aggregate incremental cost
related to relocation included moving expenses, househunting meal and
transportation expenses, temporary living expenses, and closing costs incurred
in connection with his new home (such as loan origination fees, points and other
closing fees).

Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2008

The
table below sets forth each named executive officer’s annual Teamshare bonus
opportunity established for fiscal 2008. Actual bonus amounts earned by each
named executive officer for fiscal 2008 as a result of our EBITDA performance
are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above and represent prorated
payment on a graduated scale for performance above the target EBITDA performance
level, but below the maximum payout cap of $2.5 million, for each of the named
executive officers.  Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe did not receive a Teamshare
payout for fiscal 2008 due to their employment separations from the Company
prior to the end of the fiscal year.  See “Short-Term Incentive Plan” in
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above for further discussion of the
fiscal 2008 Teamshare program.

We
did not make any equity awards to our named executive officers in fiscal 2008.
 Accordingly, we have omitted from this table all columns pertaining to
equity grants.


Outstanding Equity Awards at 2008 Fiscal
Year-End

The
table below sets forth information regarding outstanding equity awards held by
our named executive officers as of the end of fiscal 2008, including (1) equity
awards granted under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan; and (2) Rollover Options, as
defined and discussed following the table, granted under our 1998 Stock
Incentive Plan.  We have omitted from this table the columns pertaining to
stock awards under equity incentive plans because they are inapplicable.


(1)

The options reported in this column
were granted under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and are scheduled to vest 25%
per year on July 6, 2009, July 6, 2010, July 6, 2011 and July 6, 2012. In
addition, these options are subject to certain accelerated vesting provisions as
described in “Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control”
below.

(2)

If we achieve specific EBITDA
targets, options reported in this column, which were granted under our 2007
Stock Incentive Plan, are eligible to vest 1/3 per year on January 29, 2010,
January 28, 2011, and February 3, 2012.  If an annual EBITDA target is not
met, these options may still vest on a “catch up” basis if, at the end of fiscal
years 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2012, the applicable cumulative EBITDA target is
achieved.  These options also are subject to certain accelerated vesting
provisions as described in “Potential Payments upon Termination or
Change-in-Control” below.

(3)

These restricted shares were granted
under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan and are scheduled to vest upon the earliest
to occur of:  a change in control of the Company, an initial public
offering of the Company, Mr. Dreiling’s termination without cause or due to
death or disability, Mr. Dreiling’s resignation for good reason, or February 3,
2012.

(4)

Based on a per share fair market
value of $5.50 as of January 30, 2009 as determined by our Board in good faith.
 Such good faith determination was based upon (a) a third party valuation
as of January 30, 2009; (b) management’s opinion that no events have occurred
between such third party valuation date and the date of the Board’s
determination that would materially change the information used as a basis for
such third party valuation; and (c) all other material factors known to the
Board at the time of the determination, including a report on material pending
and threatened litigation and financial results through the end of the period
immediately preceding the date of such valuation.

(5)

These options were granted under our
2007 Stock Incentive Plan and vested on July 6, 2008.

(6)

These options were granted under our
2007 Stock Incentive Plan and vested 50% as of February 1, 2008 and 50% as of
January 30, 2009.

(7)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested on August 12, 2003.

(8)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested on March 13, 2004.

(9)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested on July 6, 2007.

(10)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested 25% on August 9, 2005 and 75% on
February 3, 2006.

(11)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested 25% on August 24, 2005 and 75% on
February 3, 2006.

(12)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested 25% on March 16, 2007 and 75% on July 6, 2007.

(13)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested 25% per year on December 2, 2004 and December 2,
2005 and 50% on February 3, 2006.

(14)

The options for which these Rollover
Options were exchanged vested 25% per year on August 26, 2004, August 26, 2005,
August 26, 2006 and July 6, 2007.

Mr.
Buley and Ms. Lowe held no outstanding equity awards at fiscal year end due to
their separation from our employment during fiscal 2008. See “Option Exercises
and Stock Vested During Fiscal 2008”.

In
connection with the Merger, certain named executive officers elected to roll
over all or a portion of their options held prior to the Merger (the “Rollover
Options”) rather than receive in exchange for each such option the cash Merger
consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to
$22.00 less the exercise price of each option. The exercise


price
of the Rollover Options and the number of shares underlying the Rollover Options
were adjusted as a result of the Merger to provide their pre-Merger value
equivalents. The Rollover Options are fully vested and are deemed to have been
granted, and otherwise continue, under the terms of our 1998 Stock Incentive
Plan under which the original options were issued.

See
“Long-Term Incentive Program” in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above
for discussion of the terms of the equity awards granted under the 2007 Stock
Incentive Plan.

Option Exercises and Stock Vested During Fiscal

In
connection with Mr. Buley’s and Ms. Lowe’s employment separations, we exercised
our call rights under our Management Stockholder’s Agreement with each of Mr.
Buley and Ms. Lowe to purchase all of our outstanding equity owned by each such
executive, including shares of stock previously purchased from us by each
executive as well as all vested options and Rollover Options held by each
executive. All unvested options held by Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe were
automatically cancelled upon the employment terminations.  The table below
provides information regarding the value realized by Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe upon
our purchase of vested stock options and Rollover Options pursuant to each
Management Stockholder’s Agreement. The vested options and Rollover Options were
cancelled upon their purchase by us from each of Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe. We have
omitted from this table the columns pertaining to stock awards because they are
inapplicable.

(1)

Represents the
aggregate dollar amount realized by each named executive officer upon the
transfer of vested options and Rollover Options to us when we exercised our call
rights under the applicable Management Stockholder’s Agreement. The value
realized is computed by multiplying the number of vested options and Rollover
Options by the difference between the per share fair market value of our common
stock as determined by our Board as of the last day of the month preceding the
call ($5.00) and the per share exercise price of the vested options ($5.00) and
Rollover Options ($1.25). Such good faith determination was based upon (a) a
third party valuation as of May 2, 2008; (b) management’s opinion that no events
have occurred between such third party valuation date and the date of the
Board’s determination that would materially change the information used as a
basis for such third party valuation; and (c) all other


material
factors known to the Board at the time of the determination, including a report
on material pending and threatened litigation and financial results through the
end of the period immediately preceding the date of such valuation.  The
amounts reported in this column were previously reported in the same column in
the Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table in our Form 10-K for the 2007 fiscal
year because they represented the value that the applicable named executive
officer would have received in the Merger in exchange for options held prior to
the Merger, but which value the executive chose to roll over into the Rollover
Options that we called in 2008. Ms. Lowe also realized $130,275 not reflected in
this table as a result of our call of shares of stock that she previously
purchased from us at fair market value.

Pension Benefits

Fiscal 2008

We
have omitted the Pension Benefits table as it is inapplicable.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

Fiscal 2008

Information
regarding each named executive officer’s participation in our CDP/SERP Plan is
included in the following table. The material terms of the CDP/SERP Plan are
described after the table.  Please also see “Benefits and Perquisites” in
“Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above.

(1)

Reported as "Salary" in the Summary
Compensation Table.

(2)

Reported as "All Other Compensation"
in the Summary Compensation Table.

(3)

The amounts shown in this column are
not reported in the Summary Compensation Table because they do not represent
above-market or preferential earnings.

(4)

Includes the following amounts
previously reported as compensation to each named executive officer in the
Summary Compensation Table in the Form 10-K or proxy statements, as applicable,
filed for the fiscal years indicated:


*

Amounts for Mss. Guion and Lanigan
represent the respective aggregate amounts previously reported in the Summary
Compensation Table contained in the proxy statement filed in calendar year 2005
with respect to compensation in fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004.

Pursuant
to the CDP, named executive officers may annually elect to defer up to 65% of
base salary if their compensation is in excess of the Internal Revenue Service
limit set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and up to 100% of bonus pay if their
compensation equals or exceeds the Internal Revenue Service highly compensated
limit under Section 414(g)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. We currently
match base pay deferrals at a rate of 100%, up to 5% of annual salary, with
annual salary offset by the amount of match-eligible salary under the 401(k)
plan. All named executive officers are 100% vested in all compensation and
matching deferrals and earnings on those deferrals.

Pursuant
to the SERP, we make an annual contribution equal to a certain percentage of a
participant's annual salary and bonus to all participants who are actively
employed in an eligible job grade on January 1 and continue to be employed
as of December 31 of a given year. Persons hired after May 27, 2008 (the
“Eligibility Freeze Date”) are not eligible to participate in the SERP. The
contribution percentage is based on age, years of service and job grade. The
fiscal 2008 contribution percentage for each eligible named executive officer
was 7.5% for Mr. Bere, Mr. Tehle and Ms. Guion and 4.5% for
Ms. Lanigan. Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe were not eligible for a fiscal 2008
contribution due to their employment separations prior to December 31, 2008.
 Mr. Dreiling was not eligible for a fiscal 2008 contribution because he
was not employed by us as of January 1, 2008.

As
a result of the Merger, which constituted a change-in-control under the CDP/SERP
Plan, all previously unvested SERP amounts vested on July 6, 2007. For
newly eligible SERP participants after July 6, 2007 but prior to the
Eligibility Freeze Date, SERP amounts vest at the earlier of the participant's
attainment of age 50 or the participant's being credited with 10 or more "years
of service", or upon termination of employment due to death or "total and
permanent disability" or upon a “change-in-control”, all as defined in the
CDP/SERP Plan.


The
amounts deferred or contributed to the CDP/SERP Plan are credited to a liability
account, which is then invested at the participant's option in an account that
mirrors the performance of a fund or funds selected by the Compensation
Committee or its delegate (the "Mutual Fund Options"). Beginning on August 2,
2008, these funds are identical to the funds offered in our 401(k) Plan.

A
participant who ceases employment with at least 10 years of service or
after reaching age 50 and whose CDP account balance or SERP account balance
exceeds $25,000 may elect for that account balance to be paid in cash by
(a) lump sum, (b) monthly installments over a 5, 10 or 15-year period
or (c) a combination of lump sum and

installments.  Otherwise, payment is made in a
lump sum.  The vested amount will be payable at the time designated by the
Plan upon the participant's termination of employment. A participant's CDP/SERP
benefit normally is payable in the following February if employment ceases
during the first 6 months of a calendar year or is payable in the following
August if employment ceases during the last 6 months of a calendar year.
However, participants may elect to receive an in-service lump sum distribution
of vested amounts credited to the CDP account, provided that the date of
distribution is no sooner than 5 years after the end of the year in which
the amounts were deferred. In addition, a participant who is actively employed
may request an "unforeseeable emergency hardship" in-service lump sum
distribution of vested amounts credited to the participant’s CDP account.
 Account balances deemed to be invested in the Mutual Fund Options are
payable in cash.  As a result of the Merger, the CDP/SERP Plan liabilities
through July 6, 2007 were fully funded into an irrevocable rabbi trust. We also
funded into the rabbi trust deferrals into the CDP/SERP Plan between July 6,
2007 and October 15, 2007. All CDP/SERP Plan liabilities incurred on or after
October 15, 2007 are unfunded.

Potential Payments upon Termination or
Change-in-Control

Other
than with respect to Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe, the tables below reflect potential
payments to each of our named executive officers in various termination and
change-in-control scenarios based on compensation, benefit, and equity levels in
effect on January 30, 2009. The amounts shown assume that the termination or
change-in-control event was effective as of January 30, 2009. For stock
valuations, we have assumed that the price per share is the fair market value of
our stock on January 30, 2009 ($5.50), which was the value determined by our
Board of Directors in good faith based upon a third party valuation as of
January 30, 2009 and the other factors described in footnote 4 to the

table set forth under “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2008 Fiscal
Year-End” above . The amounts shown are merely estimates. We cannot determine
the actual amounts to be paid until the time of the named executive officer’s
termination of employment or the time of a change-in-control.

Because
Mr. Buley’s and Ms. Lowe’s employment separations occurred prior to the end of
fiscal 2008, we discuss below, and the tables below present, the payments they
actually received in connection with such employment separations.


Payments
Regardless of Manner of Termination

Regardless
of the termination scenario, the named executive officers will receive (and Mr.
Buley and Ms. Lowe received) earned but unpaid base salary through the
employment termination date, along with any other payments or benefits owed
under any of our plans or agreements covering the named executive officer as
governed by the terms of those plans or agreements. These benefits include
vested amounts in the CDP/SERP Plan discussed under “Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation” above.

The
tables below exclude any amounts payable to the named executive officer to the
extent that they are available generally to all salaried employees and do not
discriminate in favor of our executive officers.

Payments Upon
Termination Due to Retirement

Retirement
is not treated differently from any other voluntary termination without good
reason (as defined under the relevant agreements) under any of our plans or
agreements for named executive officers, except that all Rollover Options will
remain exercisable for a period of 3 years following the named executive
officer’s retirement unless the options expire earlier.  To be entitled to
the extended exercise period for the Rollover Options, the retirement must occur
on or after the named executive officer reaches the age of 65 or, with our
express consent, prior to age 65 in accordance with any applicable early
retirement policy then in effect or as may be approved by our Compensation
Committee.

Payments Upon
Termination Due to Death or Disability

In
the event of death or disability, with respect to each named executive
officer:

·

The
20% portion of the time-based options that would have become exercisable on the
next anniversary date of the Merger if the named executive officer had remained
employed with us through that date will become vested and exercisable.

·

The
20% portion of the performance-based options that would have become exercisable
in respect of the fiscal year in which the named executive officer’s employment
terminates if the named executive officer had remained employed with us through
that date, will remain outstanding through the date we determine whether the
applicable performance targets are met for that fiscal year.  If the
performance targets are met for that fiscal year, that 20% portion of the
performance-based options will become exercisable on such performance-vesting
determination date. Otherwise, that 20% portion will be forfeited.

·

All
unvested options will be forfeited, and vested options generally may be
exercised (by the employee’s survivor in the case of death) for a period of 1
year (3 years in the case of Rollover Options) from the service termination date
unless we purchase such vested options in total at the fair market value of the
shares of our common stock underlying the vested options less the aggregate
exercise price of the vested options.


In
the event of death, each named executive officer’s beneficiary will receive
payments under our group life insurance program in an amount, up to a maximum of
$3 million, equal to 2.5 times the named executive officer’s annual base
salary. We have excluded from the tables below amounts that the named executive
officer would receive under our disability insurance program since the same
benefit level is provided to all of our salaried employees. The named executive
officer’s CDP/SERP Plan benefit also becomes fully vested (to the extent not
already vested) upon his or her death and is payable in a lump sum within
60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which the named executive
officer’s death occurs.

In
the event of disability, each named executive officer’s CDP/SERP Plan benefit
becomes fully vested (to the extent not already vested) and is payable in a lump
sum within 60 days after the end of the calendar quarter in which we
receive notification of the determination of the named executive officer’s
disability by the Social Security Administration.

In
addition to the foregoing payments and benefits, in the event of Mr. Dreiling’s
death or termination of employment due to disability,

any then unvested shares of his 890,000
restricted shares will vest. In the event of Mr. Dreiling’s termination of
employment due to disability, he will also be entitled to receive any incentive
bonus accrued in respect of any of our previously completed fiscal years but
unpaid as of the date of his termination. In the event of his termination of
employment due to his disability, he will also receive a lump sum cash payment,
payable at the time annual bonuses are paid to our other senior executives,
equal to a pro-rata portion of his annual incentive bonus, if any, that he would
have been entitled to receive, if such termination had not occurred, for the
fiscal year in which his termination occurred.

In
the event Mr. Bere’s employment is terminated due to death or disability, he
will also be entitled to receive any incentive bonus accrued in respect of any
of our previously completed fiscal years but unpaid as of the date of such
termination.

For
purposes of the named executive officers’ employment agreements, other than Mr.
Dreiling’s, “disability” means the employee must be disabled for purposes of our
long-term disability insurance plan. For purposes of Mr. Dreiling’s employment
agreement, “disability” means he must be disabled for purposes of our long-term
disability insurance plan or for purposes of his portable long-term disability
insurance policy. For purposes of the CDP/SERP Plan, “disability” means total
and permanent disability for purposes of entitlement to Social Security
disability benefits.

Payments Upon
Voluntary Termination

The
payments to be made to a named executive officer upon voluntary termination vary
depending upon whether the named executive officer resigns with or without “good
reason” or after our failure to offer to renew, extend or replace the named
executive officer’s employment agreement under certain circumstances. For
purposes of each named executive officer, “good reason” generally means (as more
fully described in the applicable employment agreement):


·

a
reduction in base salary or target bonus level;

·

our
material breach of the named executive officer’s employment agreement;

·

the
failure of any successor to all or substantially all of our business and/or
assets to assume and agree to perform the employment agreement;

·

our
failure to continue any significant compensation plan or benefit without
replacing it with a similar plan or a compensation equivalent (except for
across-the-board changes or terminations similarly affecting at least 95% of all
of our executives);

·

relocation
of our principal executive offices outside of the middle-Tennessee area or
basing the officer anywhere other than our principal executive offices; or

·

assignment
of duties inconsistent, or the significant reduction of the title, powers and
functions associated, with the named executive officer’s position, all without
the named executive officer’s written consent. For all named executive officers
other than Mr. Dreiling, such acts will not constitute good reason if it results
from our restructuring or realignment of duties and responsibilities for
business reasons that leaves the named executive officer at the same
compensation and officer level and with similar responsibility levels or results
from the named executive officer’s failure to meet performance criteria.

No
event (in the case of Messrs. Dreiling and Bere, no isolated, insubstantial and
inadvertent event not in bad faith) will constitute "good reason" if we cure the
claimed event within 30 days (10 business days in the case of Messrs.
Dreiling and Bere) after receiving notice from the named executive officer.

Voluntary
Termination with Good Reason or After Failure to Renew the Employment
Agreement.

If any named executive officer resigns with good
reason, all then unvested option grants held by that officer will be forfeited.
Unless we purchase any then vested options (including Rollover Options) in total
at a price equal to the fair market value of the shares underlying the vested
options, less the aggregate exercise price of the vested options, the named
executive officer generally may exercise vested options for a period of 180 days
(90 days in the case of Rollover Options) from the termination date.

Any
unvested shares of Mr. Dreiling’s 890,000 shares of restricted stock will vest
if he resigns with good reason.

In
the event any named executive officer (other than Mr. Dreiling or Mr. Bere)
resigns under the circumstances described in (2) below, or in the event we fail
to extend the term of Mr. Dreiling’s employment as provided in (3) below, the
relevant named executive officer’s equity will be treated as described under
“Voluntary Termination without Good Reason” below.

Additionally,
if the named executive officer (1) resigns with good reason, or (2) in the case
of named executive officers other than Mr. Dreiling and Mr. Bere, resigns within
60 days of


our
failure to offer to renew, extend or replace the named executive officer’s
employment agreement before, at or within 60 days after the end of the
agreement's term (unless we enter into a mutually acceptable severance
arrangement or the resignation is a result of the named executive officer’s
voluntary retirement or termination), or (3) in the case of Mr. Dreiling, in the
event we elect not to extend the term of his employment by providing 60 days
prior written notice before the applicable extension date, then the named
executive officer will receive the following benefits as soon as
administratively practicable after the 60

th

day after termination of
employment but contingent upon the execution and effectiveness of a release of
certain claims against us and our affiliates in the form attached to the named
executive officer’s employment agreement:

·

Continuation
of base salary, as in effect immediately before the termination, for
24 months payable in accordance with our normal payroll cycle and
procedures (Mr. Bere will instead receive a lump sum payment equal to 2 times
his base salary in effect on July 6, 2007).

·

A
lump sum payment equal to 2 times the named executive officer’s target incentive
bonus then in effect (Mr. Dreiling’s target incentive bonus payment instead will
be payable over 24 months; Mr. Bere will instead receive a lump sum payment
equal to 2 times the target incentive bonus he was eligible to earn under our
bonus plan as in effect on July 6, 2007).

·

A
lump sum payment equal to 2 times our annual contribution for the named
executive officer’s participation in our medical, dental and vision benefits
program (in the case of Mr. Dreiling, the medical, dental and vision benefit
instead will be in the form of a continuation of these benefits to Mr. Dreiling,
his spouse and his eligible dependents to the extent covered immediately prior
to the employment termination, for 2 years from the termination date or, if
earlier, until he is or becomes eligible for comparable coverage under the group
health plans of a subsequent employer).

·

Mr.
Dreiling will receive a prorated bonus payment based on our performance for the
fiscal year, paid at the time bonuses are normally paid for that fiscal
year.

·

If
Mr. Bere’s termination occurred prior to the payment of our fiscal 2008 bonus,
he would receive a lump sum payment of his fiscal 2008 bonus, determined as if
he had remained employed through the date necessary to receive the payment of
the fiscal 2008 bonus but prorated based on the number of months during fiscal
2008 during which he was employed by us.

·

Outplacement
services, at our expense, for 1 year or, if earlier, until other employment is
secured.

Note
that any amounts owed to a named executive officer in the form of salary
continuation that would otherwise have been paid during the 60 day period after
the named executive officer’s employment termination will instead be payable in
a single


lump
sum as soon as administratively practicable after the 60

th

day after
such termination date and the remainder will be paid in the form of salary
continuation payments as set forth above.

Subject
to any applicable prohibition on acceleration of payment under Section 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), we may, at any
time and in our sole discretion, elect to make a lump-sum payment of all these
amounts (other than Mr. Dreiling’s medical, dental and vision benefit
continuation which shall be provided over 24 months), or all other earned, but
unpaid amounts, due as a result of this type of termination.

The
named executive officer will forfeit any unpaid severance amounts upon a
material breach of any continuing obligation under the employment agreement or
the release (the “Continuing Obligations”), which include:

·

The
named executive officer must maintain the confidentiality of, and refrain from
disclosing or using, our (a) trade secrets for any period of time as the
information remains a trade secret under applicable law and (b) confidential
information for a period of 2 years following the employment termination
date.

·

For
a period of 2 years after the employment termination date, the named executive
officer may not accept or work in a “competitive position” within any state in
which we maintain stores at the time of his termination date or any state in
which we have specific plans to open stores within 6 months of that date.
 For this purpose, “competitive position” means any employment, consulting,
advisory, directorship, agency, promotional or independent contractor
arrangement between the named executive officer and any person engaged wholly or
in material part in the business in which we are engaged, including but not
limited to Wal-Mart, Target, K-Mart, Walgreen’s, Rite-Aid, CVS, Family Dollar
Stores, Fred’s, the 99 Cents Stores, and Dollar Tree Stores (and, with respect
to Messrs. Dreiling and Bere, Costco, BJ’s Wholesale Club, Casey’s General
Stores and The Pantry, Inc.; and also, with respect to Mr. Bere, Longs Drug
Stores; Walgreen’s, Rite-Aid and CVS are not specifically listed in Mr.
Dreiling’s employment agreement), or any person then planning to enter the deep
discount consumable basics retail business, if the named executive officer is
required to perform services for that person which are substantially similar to
those he or she provided or directed at any time while employed by us.

·

For
a period of 2 years after the employment termination date, the named
executive officer may not actively recruit or induce any of our exempt employees
(exempt executives in the case of Mr. Dreiling) to cease employment with us.

·

For
a period of 2 years after the employment termination date, the named
executive officer may not solicit or communicate with any person who has a
business relationship with us and with whom the named executive officer had
contact while employed by us, if that contact would likely interfere with our
business relationships or result in an unfair competitive advantage over us.


·

The
named executive officer may not engage in any communications to persons outside
Dollar General which disparages Dollar General or interferes with our existing
or prospective business relationships.

Voluntary
Termination without Good Reason.

If the named executive officer
resigns without good reason, he or she will forfeit all unvested equity grants
and all vested but unexercised options (other than Rollover Options).
 Rollover Options are fully exercisable and generally may be exercised for
3 months from the termination date unless they expire earlier or unless we
repurchase them, on a per share basis, at a per share price equal to the lesser
of (1) the fair market value of one of our shares, minus the per share exercise
price of a Rollover Option or (2) the sum of (x) $5.00 per share (the “Base
Price”) plus (y) the applicable percentage (e.g., 20% for each anniversary of
July 6, 2007 or each anniversary of the grant date, depending upon the executive
officer) of the excess of the fair market value of one of our shares over the
per share Base Price, minus (z) the per share exercise price of a Rollover
Option.

Payments Upon
Involuntary Termination

The
payments to be made to a named executive officer upon involuntary termination
vary depending upon whether termination is with or without “cause”. For purposes
of each named executive officer, “cause” generally means (as more fully
described in the applicable employment agreement):

·

Attendance
at work in a state of intoxication or in possession of any prohibited drug or
substance which would amount to a criminal offense;

·

Assault
or other act of violence;

·

Any
act involving fraud or dishonesty;

·

Any
material breach of any SEC or other law or regulation or any Dollar General
policy governing securities trading or inappropriate disclosure or
"tipping";

·

Any
activity or public statement, other than as required by law, that prejudices
Dollar General or reduces our good name and standing or would bring Dollar
General into public contempt or ridicule; or

·

Conviction
of, or plea of guilty or

nolo contendere

to, any felony whatsoever or any
misdemeanor that would preclude employment under our hiring policy.

For
purposes of determining treatment of a named executive officer’s Rollover
Options, “cause” means, to the extent that our Compensation Committee determines
that it is directly and materially harmful to our business or reputation:

·

A
felony conviction or the failure to contest prosecution of a felony; or

·

Willful
misconduct or dishonesty.


Involuntary
Termination for Cause.

If the named executive officer is
involuntarily terminated for cause, he or she will forfeit all unvested equity
grants, as well as all vested but unexercised options. However, we may
repurchase all Rollover Options at a per share price equal to the lesser of (x)
Base Price over the per share exercise price of these options and (y) the fair
market value of one of our shares underlying these options over the per share
exercise price of these options.

Involuntary
Termination without Cause.

If the named executive officer is
involuntarily terminated without cause, the named executive officer’s equity
grants will be treated as described under “Voluntary Termination with Good
Reason or After Failure to Renew the Employment Agreement” above. In addition,
each named executive officer will receive the applicable payments and benefits
as described under “Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or After Failure to
Renew the Employment Agreement” above.

Payments After a
Change-in-Control

Upon
a change-in-control, regardless of whether the named executive officer’s
employment terminates:

·

All
unvested time-based options will become fully vested and exercisable, and all
unvested performance-based options will become fully vested and exercisable
subject to KKR’s achievement of certain return-based performance targets.

·

All
CDP/SERP Plan benefits will become fully vested (to the extent not already
vested).

·

Any
then unvested shares of Mr. Dreiling’s 890,000 shares of restricted stock will
vest.

If
the named executive officer, other than Messrs. Dreiling or Bere, is
involuntarily terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, in each case
within 2 years following a change-in-control that constitutes a change in
ownership or effective control within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of
the Code, he or she will receive, as soon as administratively practicable after
the 60

th

day after the employment termination but contingent upon
execution and effectiveness of a release of certain claims against us and our
affiliates in the form attached to the relevant employment agreement, a lump sum
payment equal to the sum of (x) 2 times the named executive officer’s annual
base salary plus 2 times the named executive officer’s target incentive bonus,
each as in effect immediately prior to the change-in-control (or in each case,
if greater, at the employment termination date) plus (y) 2 times our annual
contribution for the named executive officer’s participation in our medical,
dental and vision benefits program. The named executive officer also will
receive outplacement services, at our expense, for 1 year or, if earlier,
until other employment is secured.

If
the named executive officer, other than Messrs. Dreiling or Bere, is
involuntarily terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, in each case
within 2 years following a change-in-control that does not constitute a change
in ownership or effective control within the


meaning
of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code, the termination will be treated in the
same manner as a voluntary termination with good reason as described under
“Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or after Failure to Renew the Employment
Agreement” above.

For
Messrs. Dreiling and Bere, an involuntary termination without cause or a
resignation for good reason following a change-in-control event will be treated
in the same manner as a “Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or After Failure
to Renew the Employment Agreement” as described above.

If
any payments or benefits in connection with a change-in-control would be subject
to the “golden parachute” excise tax under federal income tax rules, we will pay
an additional amount to the named executive officer to cover the excise tax and
any other excise and income taxes resulting from this payment. However, if after
receiving this payment the named executive officer’s after-tax benefit would not
be at least $25,000 more than it would be without this payment, then this
payment will not be made and the severance and other benefits due to the named
executive officer will be reduced so that the golden parachute excise tax is not
incurred.

For
purposes of the CDP/SERP Plan and the named executive officers’ (other than
Messrs. Dreiling and Bere) employment agreements, a change-in-control generally
is deemed to occur (as more fully described in those documents):

·

if
any person (other than Dollar General or any of our employee benefit plans)
acquires 35% or more of our voting securities (other than as a result of our
issuance of securities in the ordinary course of business);

·

for
purposes of our CDP/SERP Plan, if a majority of our Board members at the
beginning of any consecutive 2-year period are replaced within that period
without the approval of at least 2/3 of our Board members who served as
directors at the beginning of the period;

·

for
purposes of the specified employment agreements, if a majority of our Board
members as of the effective date of the applicable employment agreement are
replaced without the approval of at least 75% of our Board members who served as
directors on that effective date or are replaced, even with this 75% approval,
by persons who initially assumed office as a result of an actual or threatened
election contest or other actual or threatened proxy solicitation other than by
our Board; or

·

upon
the consummation of a merger, other business combination or sale of assets of,
or cash tender or exchange offer or contested election with respect to, Dollar
General if less than 65% (less than a majority, for purposes of our CDP/SERP
Plan) of our voting securities are held after the transaction in the aggregate
by holders of our securities immediately prior to the transaction.

For
purposes of the treatment of equity discussed above, a change-in-control
generally means (as more fully described in the Management Stockholder’s
Agreement between us and the named executive officers) one or a series of
related transactions described below which results in


us,
KKR and its affiliates or an employee benefit plan referenced below ceasing to
hold the ability to elect (or cause to be elected) a majority of our Board
members:

·

the
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Buck Holdings, L.P. or us
 and our subsidiaries to any person (or group of persons acting in
concert), other than to (x) investment funds affiliated with KKR or its
affiliates or (y) any employee benefit plan (or trust forming a part thereof)
maintained by us, KKR or our respective affiliates or other person of which a
majority of its voting power or other equity securities is owned, directly or
indirectly, by us, KKR or our respective affiliates; or

·

a
merger, recapitalization or other sale by us, KKR (indirectly) or any of our
respective affiliates, to a person (or group of persons acting in concert) of
our common stock or our other voting securities that results in more than 50% of
our common stock or our other voting securities (or any resulting company after
a merger) being held, directly or indirectly, by a person (or group of persons
acting in concert) that is not controlled by (x) KKR or its affiliates or (y) an
employee benefit plan (or trust forming a part thereof) maintained us, KKR or
our respective affiliates or other person of which a majority of its voting
power or other equity securities is owned, directly or indirectly, by us, KKR or
our respective affiliates.

Payments to Mr.
Buley and Ms. Lowe

Mr.
Buley’s and Ms. Lowe’s employment with us ended in April 2008 and September
2008, respectively.  Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe each received the following
payments and benefits under their respective employment agreements and other
plans in which he or she participated.  The severance payments were
contingent upon execution and effectiveness of a release of certain claims
against us and our affiliates in the form attached to the relevant employment
agreement.

·

A
lump sum payment equal to the sum of (x) 2 times the sum of his or her annual
base salary as in effect at the relevant employment termination date, plus (y) 2
times his or her target incentive bonus for fiscal 2008, plus (z) 2 times our
annual contribution for his or her participation in our medical, dental and
vision benefits program.

·

In
lieu of providing Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe the third party outplacement services
described above, we paid a cash amount to each equal to the estimated amount we
would have incurred to provide such services.

·

All
unvested equity grants automatically terminated.

·

We
exercised our call rights under our Management Stockholder’s Agreement with each
of Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe to purchase all of our outstanding equity owned by
each such executive, including shares of stock previously purchased from us by
Ms. Lowe, as well as all vested options and vested Rollover Options held by each
executive.  See “Option Exercises and Stock Vested during Fiscal 2008”
above.


We
also transferred to Ms. Lowe the title to her Company-provided vehicle (valued
at $32,650), and we extended to her and her eligible dependents coverage under
our health benefits plan from the date of her termination through December 31,
2008.  Ms. Lowe paid 100% of the premium costs of such extended insurance
coverage.

Mr.
Buley and Ms. Lowe are subject to the Continuing Obligations set forth under
“Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or After Failure to Renew the Employment
Agreement” above.  However, because all severance amounts have been paid to
Mr. Buley and Ms. Lowe in full, we will have no right to recoup those payments
in the event either such person breaches any of the Continuing Obligations.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation

Each
of Messrs. Michael Calbert, Raj Agrawal and Adrian Jones was a member of our
Compensation Committee during fiscal 2008. None of these persons was at any time
during fiscal 2008 an officer or employee of Dollar General or any of our
subsidiaries, or an officer of Dollar General or any of our subsidiaries at any
time prior to fiscal 2008.  Messrs. Calbert and Agrawal, due to their
relationships with KKR, and Mr. Jones, due to his relationship with Goldman,
Sachs & Co., may be viewed as having an indirect material interest in
certain relationships and transactions with KKR and Goldman, Sachs & Co
discussed under Item 13 below. Mr. Dreiling serves and, for a portion of fiscal
2008, Mr. Bere served as a director of Buck Holdings, LLC, for which Messrs.
Calbert, Agrawal and Jones serve as executive officers.

(b)

Director
Compensation.

The following table and text discuss the
compensation of persons who served as a member of our Board of Directors during
all or part of fiscal 2008, other than Mr. Dreiling and Mr. Bere each of whose
compensation is discussed under “Executive Compensation” above and who was not
separately compensated for Board service. We have omitted from this table the
columns pertaining to stock awards, option awards, non-equity incentive plan
compensation, and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings because they are
inapplicable.

Fiscal 2008 Director Compensation

(1)

Perquisites and
personal benefits, if any, totaled less than $10,000 per director.

(2)

Mr. Nelson
resigned from our Board of Directors on March 16, 2009.


Our
director compensation structure encompasses only cash compensation.  Cash
fees payable to our non-employee directors consist solely of a $40,000 annual
retainer fee, payable in quarterly installments. We do not compensate for Board
service any director who simultaneously serves as a Dollar General employee. We
will reimburse directors for certain fees and expenses incurred in connection
with continuing education seminars and for travel and related expenses related
to Dollar General business. We allow directors to travel on the Dollar General
airplane for those purposes.

Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management.

The following
table shows the amount of our common stock beneficially owned, as of March 17,
2009, by those who were known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our
common stock, by our directors and named executive officers individually and by
our directors and all of our executive officers as a group, all calculated in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act under which a person generally is
deemed to beneficially own a security if he has or shares voting or investment
power over the security or if he has the right to acquire beneficial ownership
within 60 days. Unless otherwise noted, these persons may be contacted at our
executive offices and, to our knowledge, have sole voting and investment power
over the shares


listed.
Percentage computations are based on 556,227,947 shares of our stock outstanding
as of March 17, 2009.

Buck Holdings Co-Invest, LP (30,210,020). Buck Holdings Co-Invest GP, LLC, which
is controlled through KKR Associates 2006 L.P. by KKR 2006 GP LLC, is the
general partner of Buck Holdings Co-Invest, LP, and has the right to manage the

CERTAIN
RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

(a)

Director
Independence.

Our Board of Directors consists of Richard Dreiling,
Michael Calbert, Raj Agrawal and Adrian Jones. Messrs. Calbert and Agrawal serve
on our Audit Committee and, along with Mr. Jones, on our Compensation Committee.
 David Bere served on our Board until March 2008, and Dean Nelson served on
our Board until March 2009.

Though
not formally considered by our Board given that our securities are not
registered or traded on a national securities exchange, we do not believe any of
our current Board members or Messrs. Bere or Nelson would be considered
independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, on which
our common stock was listed prior to the Merger, either because of service on
our management team or relationships with certain affiliates of the funds and
other entities that hold significant interests in Parent, and other
relationships with us described under “Related Party Transactions” below.
 Accordingly, we do not believe that any of our Audit Committee members
would meet the independence requirements of Rule 10A-1 of the Exchange Act
or the NYSE’s audit committee independence requirements, or that any of our
Compensation Committee members would meet the NYSE’s independence requirements.
We do not have a nominating/corporate governance committee or a committee that
serves a similar purpose.

Related
Party Transactions

.  We describe below the transactions that have
occurred since the beginning of fiscal 2008, and any currently proposed
transactions, that involve Dollar General and exceed $120,000, and in which a
related party had or has a direct or indirect material interest.

Equity
Investment by Messrs. Vasos, Flanigan and Ravener

.  In fiscal 2008,
three of our executive officers, Todd Vasos, Executive Vice President, Division
President, Chief Merchandising Officer, John Flanigan, Senior Vice President of
Global Supply Chain, and Robert Ravener, Senior Vice President and Chief People
Officer, purchased shares of Dollar General common stock that were issued
pursuant to our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as follows:

*

Equals the per share fair market
value of our common stock on the effective date of purchase as determined in
good faith by our Board of Directors considering the factors referenced in, or
similar to those referenced in, Footnote 1 to the table entitled “Option
Exercises and Stock Vested During Fiscal 2008” in Item 11 above.

In
addition, in August 2008 and December 2008, each of Mr. Flanigan and Mr. Ravener
respectively indicated an intention to invest an additional $50,000 and $200,000
in Dollar General common stock in May 2009.  The number of shares each of
Messrs. Flanigan and Ravener will receive in connection with such investment
will be determined based upon the per share fair market value of our common
stock on the date of such investment in May 2009 as determined by our Board of
Directors. Upon consummation of his investment in May 2009, Mr. Flanigan will be
eligible to receive an additional grant of 80,000 stock options issued pursuant
to our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, subject to the approval of our Compensation
Committee.

The
investments set forth in the table above were a prerequisite to the eligibility
of these executives to receive grants of stock options pursuant to our 2007
Stock Incentive Plan (our Compensation Committee granted Messrs. Vasos, Flanigan
and Ravener 875,000, 320,000, and 400,000 options, respectively, during fiscal
2008, with a per share exercise price of $5.00). The shares purchased by Messrs.
Vasos, Flanigan and Ravener, along with any shares such individuals may
otherwise acquire (such as upon exercise of the stock options referenced above)
are subject to certain transfer limitations and repurchase rights by Dollar
General as set forth in a Management Stockholder’s Agreement between us and each
such executive officer.

Calls
of Equity Held by Former Executive Officers

.  In connection with
the separation from our employment of Mr. Wayne Gibson, our former Senior Vice
President of Dollar General Markets and Shrink, in June 2008 we paid Mr. Gibson
an aggregate of $348,704 (less applicable withholding for taxes and other
payroll deductions) in connection with the exercise of our call right under our
Management Stockholder’s Agreement with Mr. Gibson to purchase all of our


outstanding
equity owned by him.  Specifically, we purchased at $5.00 per share (less
any applicable option exercise price) 13,721 shares of Dollar General common
stock that he previously purchased from us for $5.00 per share, 40,000 vested
options with an exercise price of $5.00 per share and 74,693 vested options with
an exercise price of $1.25 per share.  The per share purchase price equaled
the fair market value of our common stock on the last day of the month preceding
the call, as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors pursuant to the
terms of our Management Stockholder’s Agreement with Mr. Gibson. All such vested
options were cancelled upon their purchase by us, and all 360,000 unvested
options held by Mr. Gibson were automatically cancelled upon the end of his
employment with us.

We
also exercised our call rights with respect to equity held by Mr. Buley and Ms.
Lowe, all as disclosed under “Option Exercises and Stock Vested During 2008” in
Item 11 above.

Interlocks.

Mr. Dreiling serves and, for a portion of fiscal 2008, Mr. Bere served as
a director of Buck Holdings, LLC for which Messrs. Calbert, Agrawal and Jones
(our Compensation Committee members) serve as executive officers.

Relationships
with the Investors

.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and KKR
provide management and advisory services to us and our affiliates pursuant to a
monitoring agreement with us and Parent executed in connection with the Merger
(the “Monitoring Agreement”). Under the terms of the Monitoring Agreement, among
other things, we are obligated to pay to those entities an aggregate annual
management fee plus all reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in connection
with the provision of services under the agreement. We paid to those entities an
aggregate management fee of approximately $5.1 million in fiscal 2008, $1.1
million of which was paid to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and $4.0 million of which
was paid to KKR.  We also reimbursed KKR approximately $391,086 in
expenses.  We expect to incur an aggregate annual fee for fiscal 2009 of
approximately $5.4 million plus expenses.  Thereafter, the annual
management fee will increase 5% per year. The Monitoring Agreement also provides
that such entities will be entitled to receive a fee equal to 1% of the gross
transaction value in connection with certain subsequent financing, acquisition
or disposition of assets or equity interests, recapitalization and other similar
transactions, as well as a termination fee in the event of an initial public
offering or under certain other circumstances. All such fees are to be split
based upon an agreed

upon formula, which results
in an initial split of 78.38% of this fee payable to KKR and 21.62% payable to
Goldman, Sachs & Co.

In
connection with entering into the Monitoring Agreement, on July 6, 2007 we
and Parent also entered into a separate indemnification agreement with the
parties to the Monitoring Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to provide
customary indemnification to such parties and their affiliates.

In
2008, we paid approximately $1.1 million to KKR for expenses incurred in
connection with the recruitment of Mr. Dreiling to serve as our Chief Executive
Officer, including fees paid to executive search firms and fees paid to a
management assessment firm.

Affiliates
of KKR (among other entities) are lenders under, and Citicorp North America,
Inc. serves as administrative agent and collateral agent for, our $2.3 billion
senior secured term


loan
facility.  The amount of principal outstanding under this term loan
facility at all times during fiscal 2008 and as of March 17, 2009 was $2.3
billion, and we paid no principal and approximately $133.4 million of interest
during fiscal 2008.  We paid $200,000 to Citicorp North America, Inc. for
its services relating to this facility.  For additional information
regarding the senior secured term loan facility, see the discussion under the
heading “Credit Facilities” in the Liquidity and Capital Resources portion of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations in Item 7 above.

Goldman,
Sachs & Co. is a counterparty to an amortizing interest rate swap totaling
$433.3 million as of January 30, 2009, entered into in connection with such
senior secured term loan facility. See Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" for information regarding such interest rate
swap.  We paid Goldman, Sachs & Co. approximately $9.5 million in
fiscal 2008 pursuant to the interest rate swap.

Our
Board members Mr. Calbert and Mr. Agrawal and our former Board member Mr. Nelson
serve as a Member,  a Director and a Partner of KKR, respectively, while
our Board member Mr. Jones serves as a Managing Director of Goldman, Sachs &
Co. KKR indirectly owns approximately 52% of our common stock. Goldman,
Sachs & Co. is an affiliate of GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. and
affiliated funds. GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. and affiliated funds
indirectly own approximately 22% of our common stock. Citicorp North
America Inc. is an affiliate of Citigroup Private Equity LP.  Funds
managed by Citigroup Private Equity LP indirectly own approximately 7% of our
common stock.

We
use Capstone Consulting, LLC, a team of executives who work exclusively with KKR
portfolio companies providing certain consulting services. We pay Capstone a
monthly fee, currently $210,000, plus expense reimbursements. During fiscal
2008, the aggregate fees and expenses we incurred for Capstone’s services
totaled approximately $3 million. Our former Board member Mr. Nelson is the
Chief Executive Officer of Capstone. Although neither KKR nor any entity
affiliated with KKR owns any of the equity of Capstone, KKR had provided
financing to Capstone prior to January 1, 2007.

Related
Party Transaction Approval Policy

.  On August 28, 2008, our Board
adopted a written policy for the review, approval or ratification of “related
party” transactions.  For purposes of this policy, a “related party”
includes our directors, executive officers, and greater than 5% shareholders, as
well as their immediate family members, and a “transaction” includes one in
which (1) the total amount may exceed $100,000, (2) Dollar General is a
participant, and (3) a related party will have a direct or indirect material
interest (other than as a director or a less than 10% owner of another entity,
or both).

Pursuant
to this policy and subject to certain exceptions, all known related party
transactions require prior Board approval. In addition, at least annually after
receiving a list of immediate family members and affiliates from our directors,
executive officers and over 5% shareholders, the Corporate Secretary will
coordinate with relevant internal departments to determine whether any
transactions were unknowingly entered into with a related party and will present
a list of such transactions to the Board for review.


This
policy authorizes Mr. Dreiling to approve a related party transaction in which
he is not involved if the total amount is less than $1 million and if the Board
is informed of transactions approved in this manner.  In addition, the
following transactions are deemed automatically pre-approved and require no
further Board approval or reporting to the Board:

·

Transactions
involving a related party that is an entity or involving another company with a
relationship to a related party if the total amount does not exceed the greater
of $1 million or 2% of that company’s total annual consolidated revenues (total
consolidated assets in the case of a lender) and no related party who is an
individual participates in the actual provision of services or goods to, or
negotiations with, us on the other company’s behalf or receives special
compensation as a result.

·

Charitable
contributions if the total amount does not exceed 2% of the entity’s total
annual receipts and no related party who is an individual participates in the
grant decision or receives any special compensation or benefit as a result.

·

Transactions
where the interest arises solely from share ownership in Dollar General and all
of our shareholders receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.

·

Transactions
where the rates or charges are determined by competitive bid.

·

Transactions
for services as a common or contract carrier or public utility at rates or
charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority.

·

Transactions
involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar,
trustee under a trust indenture, or similar services.

·

Compensatory
transactions available on a nondiscriminatory basis to all salaried employees
generally, or ordinary course business travel and expenses and
reimbursements.

The
policy prohibits the related party from participating in any discussion or
approval of the transaction and requires the related party to provide to the
Board all material information concerning the transaction. None of the
requirements in the policy supersede or replace any separate procedures and
requirements in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or other relevant
policy.

PRINCIPAL
ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES

The
table below shows the aggregate fees Ernst & Young LLP incurred in
connection with various audit and other services provided to us throughout
fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007.

The
Audit Committee Charter requires Audit Committee pre-approval for all audit and
permissible non-audit services provided by our independent auditors. Where
feasible, the Audit Committee considers and, when appropriate, pre-approves
services at regularly scheduled meetings after disclosure by management and the
auditors of the nature of the proposed services, the estimated fees (when
available), and their opinions that the services will not impair the auditors’
independence. The Audit Committee also may consider and pre-approve any such
services in between meetings.
