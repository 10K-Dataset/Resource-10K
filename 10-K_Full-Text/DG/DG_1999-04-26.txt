ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

         Dollar General  Corporation  (the  "Company" or "Dollar  General") is a
discount retailer of quality general merchandise at everyday low prices. Through
conveniently  located  stores,  the  Company  offers  a  focused  assortment  of
consumable basic  merchandise  including  health and beauty aids,  packaged food
products,  cleaning  supplies,  housewares,  stationery,  seasonal goods,  basic
apparel and domestics.  During 1998, hardline and softline merchandise accounted
for 82% and 18% of net  sales,  respectively.  Through  convenient  neighborhood
locations,  Dollar General Stores serve  primarily low,  middle and fixed income
families.  As of January 29, 1999, the Company  operated 3,687 stores located in
24 states, primarily in the midwestern and southeastern United States.

         The Company opened its first Dollar  General Store in 1955.  During the
last five years,  the Company has experienced a rapid rate of expansion.  Dollar
General grew from 1,800 stores with an estimated  10,724,000 selling square feet
at January 31, 1994, to 3,687 stores with an estimated 23,719,000 selling square
feet at January 29,  1999.  In addition to growth from new store  openings,  the
Company recorded same-store sales increases in 1996, 1997 and 1998 of 8.2%, 8.4%
and 8.3%,  respectively.  For the years 1994  through  1998,  the  Company had a
compound  annual  growth rate in net sales,  operating  income and net income of
23.3%, 29.7% and 30.7%,  respectively.  Management believes that the Company has
the  potential to  significantly  expand its  existing  store base within the 24
states  in which it  currently  operates.  In 1999,  the  Company  plans to open
approximately 575 to 600 new stores.

Business Strategy

         The Company's  mission is "SERVING  OTHERS! A Better Life . . . for our
Customers.  A Superior  Investment . . . for our Shareholders.  A Partnership in
Total  Development . . . with our Employees." In order to carry out its mission,
the Company has  developed a business  strategy  which  includes  the  following
principal elements:


         Focus on Low, Middle and Fixed Income  Customers.  The Company seeks to
serve the consumable  basic  merchandise  needs of low,  middle and fixed income
customers.  The Company's  typical customer is a female living in a household of
three to four individuals with a household income of less than $25,000 per year.
According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census,  34% of U.S.  household  incomes for
the year 1997 were under  $25,000(median  income and income  level by  household
type.)

         "Convenience  Discount  Store"  Format.  Dollar  General Stores average
6,400 selling square feet and are usually  located within three to five miles of
customers' homes.  This appeals to the Company's target customers,  many of whom
prefer  the  convenience  of a  small,  neighborhood  store.  This  "convenience
discount  store"  format  has become  even more  appealing  to a wider  range of
consumers  as  many   discounters   have  focused   their  efforts  on  building
increasingly  larger stores outside of towns making their stores less accessible
and convenient for the Company's target customers.


         Focused  Assortment of  Consumable  Basic  Merchandise.  The Company is
committed  to  offering  a  focused  assortment  of  quality,  consumable  basic
merchandise  in a number of core  categories.  The  Company  offers  such  basic
merchandise  as  health  and  beauty  aids,  packaged  food  products,  cleaning
supplies, housewares,  stationery,  seasonal goods, basic apparel and domestics.
In 1998, hardline merchandise represented 82% of net sales. Approximately 97% of
net  sales in 1998  consisted  of  first-run  merchandise,  with  the  remainder
consisting  of  manufacturers'  overruns  and  closeouts.  In 1998,  the average
customer  transaction was approximately  $8. By consistently  offering a focused
assortment of consumable basic

merchandise,  the Company encourages customers to shop Dollar General Stores for
their everyday household needs, leading to frequent customer visits.

         Everyday Low Prices.  The  Company's  distributes  quality,  consumable
basic  merchandise  at everyday low prices.  The  Company's  low cost  operating
structure  and  focused  assortment  of  merchandise  allow it to offer  quality
merchandise with compelling  value.  The Company  emphasizes  even-dollar  price
points.  The majority of products are priced at $10 or less,  with nearly 50% of
the products priced at $1 or less. The most expensive items are generally priced
at $35.

         Low  Operating  Costs.  The  Company  maintains  strict  overhead  cost
controls  and seeks to locate  stores in  neighborhoods  where store  rental and
operating costs are low. The Company  continues to utilize new technology,  when
cost effective, in order to improve operating efficiencies. As a result of these
initiatives,  selling,  general  and  administrative  ("SG&A")  expenses,  as  a
percentage of net sales, declined to 19.1% in 1998, from 21.7% in 1993.

Growth Strategy

         Management  believes that future growth will come from a combination of
merchandising initiatives, new store growth and infrastructure leverage.

         Merchandising  Initiatives.   The  Company  continually  evaluates  its
merchandise   mix.  In  July  1998,   the   Company   rolled  out  a  series  of
family-oriented  basic apparel programs to its stores.  These programs  included
items  such as  jeans,  khakis,  T-shirts  and knit  shirts  for men,  women and
children at prices of $10 or less.  These  programs  increased  the selection of
quality  basic  apparel  without  increasing  the square  footage  allocation of
softline merchandise.  Management expects these programs may shift the Company's
sales mix slightly toward more softlines in 1999.

         For the years 1993 through 1996, net sales by product  category shifted
from 65% hardlines/35% softlines to 75% hardlines/25%  softlines. In response to
this  shift  in  customer  preference,  in  1997  the  Company  added  700  new,
faster-turning  consumable  items to the product mix. The Company also converted
stores  to a  new  prototype  with  a  space  allocation  of  65%  hardlines/35%
softlines,  compared with a 50%/50% allocation in 1996. As a result, in 1997 the
Company's  sales  mix  further  shifted  toward  hardlines  (82%   hardlines/18%
softlines).  The sales mix remained consistent at 82% hardlines/18% softlines in
1998.

         The Company will continue to evaluate the  performance  of its products
in 1999 making changes where appropriate.  Management believes these initiatives
have  contributed  and will  continue  to  contribute  to  same-store  net sales
increases.

         New Store Growth. The Company believes its "convenience discount store"
format is  portable  to towns and  neighborhoods  throughout  the  country.  The
Company  currently  serves more than 1,800  communities with populations of less
than 25,000. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census, there are approximately
18,000 such communities in the United States. The Company will continue to focus
on towns and  neighborhoods  within its  current  24-state  market  area,  where
management  believes that the Company has the potential to significantly  expand
its store base.  In 1999,  the  Company  plans to open 575 to 600 new stores and
relocate an additional 200 to 250 stores.  By opening new stores in its existing
24-state market area, the Company  leverages brand awareness and takes advantage
of  operating  efficiencies.  In  addition,  the Company  expects to explore the
potential  for  geographic   expansion  as  opportunities   present  themselves.
Currently,  the Company targets an annual new store growth rate of approximately
15% for the next several years.

         Leverage   Infrastructure  to  Improve  Margins.  As  the  Company  has
increased  its sales and  leveraged  its  infrastructure,  SG&A  expenses,  as a
percentage of net sales, have declined to 19.1% in 1998, from 21.7% in 1993. The
Company continues to make significant investments in infrastructure.  Management
believes  that  these  investments  will  enable  the  Company  to  continue  to
aggressively grow its store base while further improving its operating  margins.
The Company realizes  significant cost  efficiencies by locating stores in close
proximity to distribution  centers ("DC").  Dollar General reduces  distribution
expenses as a  percentage  of net sales and improves  in-stock  positions in its
stores by having sophisticated and well-located distribution centers. During the
next 18 months,  the Company plans to add two additional  distribution  centers,
including  the  Fulton,  Missouri  DC which is  scheduled  to open in the  third
quarter of 1999 and the  Alachua,

Florida DC which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2000.  The Company
completed  expansion of the South  Boston,  Virginia DC in the first  quarter of
1999 and plans to complete  expansion of the Ardmore,  Oklahoma DC in the second
quarter of 1999.

Merchandise

         Dollar General Stores offer a focused assortment of quality, consumable
basic  merchandise  in a number  of core  categories.  In 1998,  national  brand
merchandise  represented  more  than  35% of  net  sales,  while  manufacturers'
overruns and closeouts represented less than 3% of net sales.

         The Company believes that its merchandising strategy generates frequent
repeat customer traffic. The Company is able to offer everyday low prices to its
customers in large part because its buying staff  negotiates low purchase prices
from suppliers.  The Company  purchases its  merchandise  from a wide variety of
suppliers,  with no  supplier  accounting  for  more  than  6% of the  Company's
purchases during 1998.

         In order to fulfill the Company's  commitment to maintain high in-stock
levels of core merchandise, the Company generally limits its stock keeping units
("SKUs")  per store to  approximately  3,200  items.  The  majority of items are
priced at $1 and in increments of $1, with the most  expensive  items  generally
priced at $35. The Company believes even-dollar pricing more easily demonstrates
value to the customer and  disciplines  its merchants to  continually  negotiate
purchase  prices that conform to a limited  number of retail price  points.  The
Company  believes  the risk of inventory  obsolescence  is low because it offers
quality,  consumable  basic  merchandise.  The  Company  regularly  reviews  its
inventory to identify aged  merchandise and sells it at reduced prices to remove
it from inventory.

         Dollar General Stores receive merchandise shipments weekly from Company
distribution centers. See "Item 2. -- Properties."

The Dollar General Store

         The typical Dollar General Store has approximately 6,400 square feet of
selling space and is operated by a manager, an assistant manager and two or more
sales clerks.  Approximately 75% of the Dollar General Stores are in communities
with populations of less than 25,000. As of January 29, 1999, 67% of stores were
located in strip shopping centers, 18% were freestanding  buildings and 15% were
in  downtown  store  buildings.   The  Company  generally  has  not  encountered
difficulty  locating  suitable store sites in the past, and the Company does not
anticipate experiencing difficulty in finding suitable locations in the future.


         The Company's recent store growth is summarized in the following table:
                                                                       
                                                                               
                                                                              
Employees


         At  March  31,  1999,  the  Company  and  its   subsidiaries   employed
approximately  29,820  full-time and  part-time  employees,  including  regional
managers,  district  managers,  store  managers,  and  distribution  center  and
administrative personnel,  compared with approximately 27,400 at March 31, 1998.
The Company believes its relationship with its employees is good.

Competition

         The Company is engaged in a highly  competitive  business.  The Company
competes  with  discount  stores and with many other  retailers  including  mass
merchandise,  grocery,  drug,  convenience,  variety and other specialty stores.
Some of the largest  retail  companies  in 

the  nation  have  stores  in some of the  areas  where  the  Company  operates.
Management  believes that the Company  competes  primarily by offering  quality,
consumable basic merchandise at everyday low prices.

performance,  financial  condition  and  need for  capital  and  other  relevant
factors.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

         This discussion and analysis  contains  historical and  forward-looking
information. The forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company
believes  the  assumptions  underlying  these  forward-looking   statements  are
reasonable;  however, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore,
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements due to certain risks and  uncertainties,  including,  but not limited
to, general  transportation and distribution delays or interruptions,  inventory
risks due to shifts in market demand,  changes in product mix,  interruptions in
suppliers'  business,  costs and delays  associated  with building,  opening and
operating new distribution centers ("DC's") and stores, and year 2000 compliance
issues.  The Company  undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions
to  any  forward-looking  statements  contained  herein  to  reflect  events  or
circumstances  occurring  after  the  date  of this  report  or to  reflect  the
occurrence of unanticipated events.

         The following text contains references to years "2000", "1999", "1998",
"1997" and "1996" which represent fiscal years ending January 26, 2001,  January
28, 2000, January 29, 1999, January 30, 1998 and January 31, 1997, respectively.
This  discussion  and  analysis  should be read with,  and is  qualified  in its
entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

General

         During  1998,  Dollar  General  achieved  record sales and earnings and
continued its rapid pace of new store openings. In addition, the Company lowered
its selling,  general and administrative  expense, as a percentage of net sales,
for the ninth  consecutive  year.  Despite the start-up  costs  associated  with
opening new stores and store  remodeling  costs  associated  with the  Company's
addition of its new basic-apparel  program,  the Company increased  earnings per
diluted share by more than 20% for the third consecutive year. From 1994 through
1998,  the Company had a compound  annual  growth rate of 23.3% in net sales and
30.7% in net income.

         For the eleventh  consecutive  year,  the Company  increased  its total
number of store units. The Company opened 551 new stores in 1998,  compared with
468 in 1997 and 360 in 1996.  In 1998,  the Company  remodeled or relocated  351
stores,  compared with 195 in 1997 and 168 in 1996. During the last three years,
the  Company  opened,  remodeled  or  relocated  2,093  stores,  accounting  for
approximately  57% of the total stores at January 29, 1999.  The three states in
which the  greatest  number of new stores  were  opened  during 1998 were Texas,
North Carolina and Georgia. The Company ended the year with 3,687 stores.

         The 1998 new stores and relocations,  net of 33 closed stores, added an
aggregate of approximately  3,600,000 selling square feet to the Company's total
sales space, providing the Company with an aggregate of approximately 23,700,000
selling  square  feet  at the  end of  the  year.  The  average  store  measured
approximately  6,400 selling  square feet in 1998,  1997 and 1996. In 1998,  the
size of the average new store  increased to  approximately  6,900 selling square
feet from 6,200 in 1997 and 1996. This increase  reflects the Company's focus in
1998 on opening stores with a minimum of 6,300 selling square feet.


         In 1998, the Company introduced a new preferred  development program to
support continued new store growth.  This program enables the Company to partner
with  established  development  firms to build stores in markets where existing,
acceptable  

retail space is  unavailable.  In 1998, the Company opened 50 new stores through
this  program.  In 1999,  the  Company  plans to expand  this  program  and open
approximately 200 preferred  development  stores.  The size of these stores will
average approximately 8,100 selling square feet.


         Within its current 24-state market, the Company anticipates opening 550
to 575 new stores, net of closed stores, in addition to relocating approximately
200 to 250 existing  stores in 1999.  The Company will  continue to focus on (a)
opening  stores within 200 miles of a  distribution  center;  (b) opening stores
with a  minimum  of 6,300  selling  square  feet  and  expanding  the  preferred
development  program;  and (c)  relocating  stores with less than 5,500  selling
square feet. In 1999,  management  expects the new store average  square feet to
continue to increase slightly.


         The  Company's  sales  mix  remained  consistent  at 82%  hardlines/18%
softlines for 1998 and 1997, compared with 75% hardlines/25%  softlines in 1996.
The space  allocation of hardlines to softlines in the current  store  prototype
also remained  consistent at 65%/35% in 1998 and 1997, compared with the 50%/50%
allocation  in 1996.  In July 1998,  the Company  rolled out a new basic apparel
program in a full range of sizes for the entire family.  This program  increased
the selection of quality basic apparel  without  increasing  the square  footage
allocation  of softline  merchandise.  Management  expects that this program may
shift the  Company's  sales mix  slightly  toward more  softlines  in 1999.  The
Company will continue to evaluate the performance of its products in 1999 making
changes where appropriate. However, management does not anticipate the sales mix
or space allocation to change significantly as a result of any such changes.

         In  the  second   quarter  of  1998,   the  Company  opened  its  fifth
distribution  center,  an 826,000  square foot  facility  located in  Indianola,
Mississippi.  This opening was achieved  with minimal  disruption to the flow of
merchandise  to stores.  In July 1998,  the Company  leased and opened its sixth
distribution  center,  a 600,000  square  foot  facility  located in Villa Rica,
Georgia. This facility is dedicated to serving the initial stocking needs of new
stores.
         In the first quarter of 1999,  the Company  completed a 484,000  square
foot expansion of its South Boston,  Virginia DC. In the second quarter of 1999,
the Company  plans to complete a 450,000  square foot  expansion of its Ardmore,
Oklahoma  DC. In  addition,  the  Company  plans to open a seventh  distribution
center in Fulton,  Missouri in the third quarter of 1999.  Continuing to support
its rapidly  growing store base and  improving  distribution  efficiencies,  the
Company anticipates  opening its eighth distribution center in Alachua,  Florida
in the first quarter of 2000.  Management  believes the additional  distribution
capacity  will continue to reduce the need for outside  warehouses  during peak,
seasonal shipping periods and will accommodate planned store growth.

         In  1998,  the  Company  installed  a new  general  ledger  system  and
implemented electronic data interchange purchase ordering with approximately 600
core vendors. Among other planned technology  advancements for 1999, the Company
will  implement a new  distribution  center  merchandise  replenishment  system,
expand  its  electronic  data   interchange   capabilities  and  install  a  new
transportation  management system which will improve the routing efficiencies of
its transportation network.

Results of Operations

         Net Sales.  Net sales totaled $3.22 billion for 1998, $2.63 billion for
1997 and $2.13  billion for 1996.  These totals  represent  annual  increases of
22.6% in 1998,  23.1% in 1997 and 21.0% in 1996.  These increases  resulted from
518 net new stores and a same-store  net sales  increase of 8.3% for the 52-week
period ending  January 29, 1999;  435 net new stores and a same-store  net sales
increase  of 8.4% in 1997;  and 318 net new  stores and a  same-store  net sales
increase of 8.2% in 1996. The Company defines  same-stores as those stores which
were  opened  before  the  beginning  of the prior  fiscal  year and which  have
remained open throughout both the prior and current fiscal years.

         Gross Profit.  Gross profit for 1998 was $905.9  million  compared with
$742.1 million in 1997 and $604.8 million in 1996. Gross profit, as a percentage
of net sales, was 28.1% for 1998 compared with 28.3% for 1997 and 1996. The 1998
result  reflects an increase in  inventory  shrinkage,  as a  percentage  of net
sales, offset slightly by reduced  distribution  expense, as a percentage of net
sales, and higher initial mark-up. In 1998,  inventory shrinkage was 2.5% of net
sales compared with 2.2% in 1997 and 2.7% in 1996.  Management believes that the
Company's  continuing  focus on  delivering  the  lowest  possible  price to its
customers will result in gross profit,  as a percentage of net sales, to decline
slightly in 1999.


         Selling,  General and Administrative Expense. For the ninth consecutive
year,  the Company  reduced its  selling,  general and  administrative  ("SG&A")
expense,  as a percentage of net sales, to 19.1% in 1998, compared with 19.3% in
1997 and 19.4% in 1996. SG&A expense for 1998 was $616.6 million,  compared with
$506.6  million in 1997 and  $415.1  million  in 1996.  In 1998,  the lower SG&A
expense,  as a  percentage  of net  sales,  resulted  primarily  from (a)  lower
advertising costs through the elimination of the December  direct-mail  circular
and (b) lower employee incentive  compensation offset slightly by an increase in
workers'  compensation expense. All other expense categories remained relatively
flat, as a percent of net sales.


         Interest Expense. In 1998, interest expense was $8.3 million,  compared
with $3.8  million in 1997 and $4.7  million  in 1996.  The  increased  interest
expense in 1998 resulted primarily from increased short-term  borrowings used to
finance the increased inventory required to supply two new distribution  centers
and 518 net new  stores,  and from the  timing of the  Company's  repurchase  of
common stock. Daily average total debt outstanding equaled $153.2 million during
1998, compared with $74.8 million in 1997 and $88.0 million in 1996.

         Provision for Taxes on Income. The effective income tax rates for 1998,
1997 and 1996 were 35.2%, 37.6% and 37.8%, respectively.  The 1998 effective tax
rate  decreased as a result of effective  tax  planning  strategies.  Management
expects the effective tax rate in 1999 to increase to 36.5%.

         Net Income.  For the third  consecutive year, the Company increased net
income by more than 20%.  In 1998,  net income  totaled  $182.0  million  (25.9%
increase),  compared  with $144.6  million  (25.6%  increase) in 1997 and $115.1
million (31.1% increase) in 1996.

         Return on  Equity  and  Assets.  The  ratio of net  income  to  average
shareholders' equity was 27.8% in 1998, compared with 27.0% in 1997 and 25.4% in
1996.  Return on average  assets was 17.1% in 1998,  compared with 17.7% in 1997
and 16.5% in 1996.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         Working Capital.  Working capital  increased to $423.8 million in 1998,
compared with $359.0  million in 1997 and $280.1 million in 1996, or an increase
of 18.1% in 1998, 28.2% in 1997 and 6.7% in 1996. The ratio of current assets to
current  liabilities  (current ratio) was 1.9 in 1998, compared with 2.2 in 1997
and 1996.


         Cash Flows from  Operating  Activities.  Net cash provided by operating
activities was $218.6 million in 1998,  compared with $139.1 million in 1997 and
$170.1  million in 1996.  In 1998,  the cash  generated  from net income  before
depreciation and deferred taxes was offset partially by the increased  inventory
levels required to stock the Indianola, Mississippi and Villa Rica, Georgia DCs,
the 518 net new stores and the new basic apparel program.

         In 1997,  the cash generated  from net income before  depreciation  and
deferred taxes was offset  partially by increased  inventory  levels required to
stock the South Boston, Virginia DC and 435 net new stores.


         Cash Flows from  Investing  Activities.  Capital  expenditures  in 1998
totaled $140.3  million,  compared with $107.7 million in 1997 and $84.4 million
in 1996. The Company opened 551 new stores and relocated or remodeled 351 stores
at a cost of $61.6 million in 1998.  Capital  expenditures  during 1997 and 1996
for new, relocated and remodeled stores totaled $39.4 million and $27.0 million,
respectively.

         Distribution-related capital expenditures totaled $45.9 million in 1998
resulting primarily from costs associated with the 484,000 square foot expansion
of the South Boston,  Virginia DC and the purchase of new trailers. In 1997, the
Company spent $26.2 million  primarily on costs associated with the expansion of
the 

Scottsville,  Kentucky DC and the purchase of new trailers. In 1996, the Company
spent $38.6 million  primarily on costs  associated with the construction of the
South Boston, Virginia DC.


         During 1998, the Company  entered into agreements to sell and leaseback
the Ardmore,  Oklahoma DC  (including  the  expansion)  and the expansion of the
South  Boston,  Virginia DC. The Company  received  cash advances on these sales
prior to year end which are included in accrued expenses as of January 29, 1999.
Upon completion of the construction of these expansions, the Company will record
the sales of these properties.


         Capital expenditures during 1999 are projected to be approximately $120
million. This includes approximately $65 million for new stores, relocations and
remodels;  approximately  $20  million  for  expansion  of the  Ardmore  DC; and
approximately $20 million for transportation equipment and logistics technology.
The Company believes that its capital  expenditure  requirements in 1999 will be
met through internally generated funds.


         Cash Flows from  Financing  Activities.  Total debt at January 29, 1999
(including  current  maturities  and  short-term  borrowings)  was $1.5 million,
compared with $24.7 million in 1997 and $43.1 million in 1996. Long-term debt at
January 29, 1999 was $0.8 million,  compared with $1.3 million for 1997 and $2.6
million for 1996.  The ratio of total debt  (including  current  maturities  and
short-term  borrowings)  to equity was 0.2% at January 29, 1999,  compared  with
4.2% at January 30,  1998,  and 8.9% at January 31,  1997.  Although the average
daily  short-term debt increased to $153.2 million in 1998,  compared with $74.8
million in 1997 and $88.0  million in 1996,  the Company was able to pay off all
short-term borrowings at year-end with internally generated funds.

         Because of the significant impact of seasonal buying (e.g.,  Spring and
December holiday  purchases),  the Company's  working capital  requirements vary
significantly  during the year. These working capital requirements were financed
by short-term  borrowings under the Company's $175 million revolving credit/term
loan  agreement  and  seasonal  bank lines of credit  totaling  $165  million at
January 29, 1999. The Company's maximum outstanding  short-term  indebtedness in
1998 was  $312.6  million in  October  1998,  compared  with  $196.1  million in
November  1997.  Seasonal bank lines of credit are subject to renewal on various
dates throughout 1999, and the Company  currently  anticipates  these agreements
will be renewed. Management believes the existing revolving credit/term loan and
seasonal bank lines will be sufficient to fund its working capital  requirements
and other general corporate needs in 1999.

         In addition,  the Company has a $225 million  leveraged  lease facility
which  funds  the  construction  of new  stores,  new DCs,  and a new  corporate
headquarters. As of January 29, 1999, approximately $143 million of construction
costs had been funded under this facility  including:  approximately $50 million
for the construction of new stores; approximately $44 million for the Indianola,
Mississippi  DC;  approximately  $32 million for the  Fulton,  Missouri  DC; and
approximately $20 million for the corporate headquarters.

         In 1998,  the Company  repurchased  2,496,625  shares of common  stock,
after giving effect to the five-for-four  stock splits  distributed on March 23,
1998, and September 21, 1998, at an average cost of $29.33 per share.  Under the
current  authorization  from the Board of Directors,  the Company can repurchase
approximately 3.7 million additional shares.

Market Risk
         The  Company  is  subject to market  risk from  exposure  to changes in
interest rates based on its financing, investing and cash management activities.
The  Company  utilizes  a  credit  facility  to fund  seasonal  working  capital
requirements which is comprised primarily of variable rate debt.


Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

         The Company  believes  that  inflation  and/or  deflation had a minimal
impact on its overall operations during 1998, 1997 and 1996. In particular,  the
effect of  deflation  on cost of goods sold has been minimal as reflected by the
small decline in LIFO reserves in 1998, 1997 and 1996.

Accounting Pronouncements

         The Company  will adopt  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
for the fiscal year ending  January 26,  2001.  The Company is in the process of
analyzing the impact of the adoption of this Statement.

         The Company will adopt Statement of Position 98-1,  "Accounting for the
Costs of  Computer  Software  Developed  or  Obtained  for  Internal  Use,"  and
Statement of Position 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities," for
the year ending January 28, 2000.  Management does not believe adoption of these
Statements will have a significant impact on the Company's financial reporting.


         The Company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information," during the year ended January 29, 1999. See
Note 10 to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  appearing  elsewhere in this
report.

 Year 2000

         The Company  recognizes  that without  appropriate  modification,  some
computer  programs may not operate  properly  when asked to  recognize  the year
2000.  Upon reaching the year 2000,  these computer  programs will  inaccurately
interpret  the "00" used in two-digit  date  calculations  as the year 1900.  In
anticipation of the need to correct and otherwise prepare for any potential year
2000  computer  problems,  the Company  formed a Year 2000 Task Force (the "Task
Force") which has developed a year 2000 compliance  plan (the "Plan").  The plan
addresses the Company's  state of readiness,  the costs to address the Company's
Year 2000 issues,  the risks of the company's year 2000 issues and the Company's
contingency plans.

The Company's state of readiness

         Internal  Systems:  The Company's  Plan  addresses all of the Company's
hardware   and  software   systems,   as  well  as   equipment   controlled   by
microprocessors used in the offices, stores, and distribution centers. As a part
of the Plan,  the Task  Force has  completed  its  assessment  of the  Company's
systems, has identified the Company's hardware, software and equipment that will
not  operate  properly  in the year 2000 and in most  cases,  has  remedied  the
problem  with  programming  changes.  The  Plan  has  identified  the  Company's
accounting,  inventory  management and warehouse  management systems as critical
systems.  The Company expects the programming  changes and software  replacement
for systems that are not already year 2000  compliant  will be completed  during
the first and second  quarters of 1999.  The Company has  completed  testing the
year 2000  readiness  of many of its systems and expects to complete the testing
process by July 1999. The Company's year 2000 compliance effort has not resulted
in any material delays to other internal information technology projects.

         External Systems: The Company has requested, and is receiving,  written
confirmation  from vendors,  suppliers and other service providers ("Third Party
Vendors") as to their year 2000 system compliance  status.  Although the Company
is  diligently  seeking  and is  receiving  information  as to its  Third  Party
Vendors'  year 2000  compliance  progress,  there can be no assurance  that such
Third Party  Vendors will have  remedied  their year 2000  issues.  Although the
Company  currently  knows of no material Third Party Vendor system that will not
be year 2000 ready, the failure of any significant  Third Party Vendor to remedy
its year 2000  issues  could have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's
operations,  financial  position  or  liquidity.  The Company  will  continue to
aggressively  monitor the  progress  of its Third Party  Vendors in an effort to
mitigate its own year 2000 non-compliance risk.

The costs to address the Company's Year 2000 issues

         Based on the Company's  current  estimates,  the cost of addressing the
Company's year 2000  remediation  efforts will be between $400,000 and $600,000.
To date,  expenditures  have been less than  $100,000.  Costs are being expensed
when  incurred.  This cost  estimate  excludes the costs of  previously  planned
software  implementations  as well as salaries of existing employees involved in
the year  2000  remediation  efforts.  These  projected  costs  are  based  upon
management's best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of
future events.  However,  there can be no guarantee  that these costs  estimates
will be accurate; actual results could differ materially.

The risks of the Company's Year 2000 issues

         Management  believes  that its greatest  risk to achieving  timely year
2000  compliance  is  in  its  third-party  relationships.  For  example,  if  a
significant vendor  experiences  shipping delays because either its systems or a
Third Party Vendor's systems are not year 2000 compliant, such delays could have
a  material  impact on the  Company's  business  depending  on the nature of the
shipment  and the length of the shipping  delay.  However,  currently  available
information indicates that the Company's significant Third Party Vendors will be
year 2000 ready.  Management  also  believes  there is a moderate  level of risk
associated  with the unconfirmed  year 2000  compliance  status of small utility
companies that provide utility service to the Company's individual stores.

The Company's contingency plans

         The Company will continue to closely  monitor the year 2000  compliance
readiness of its Third Party Vendors and, where appropriate,  will replace those
Third  Party  Vendors  who appear to be  unwilling  to  confirm  their year 2000
readiness or who are unable to meet compliance  deadlines.  The Company has been
developing,  and  intends to  complete by July 1999,  a  comprehensive  business
continuity  plan  ("BCP")  that is designed to respond to  significant  business
interruption.  The BCP  focuses  on  business  recovery  and  continuation  made
necessary by natural disaster, year 2000 system non-compliance, vendor breach of
contract or any other factor.  Although it is  impossible to accurately  predict
and prepare for all risks  associated with the year 2000 issue, the Company will
continue to evaluate and modify where appropriate its BCP to address those risks
which it believes are reasonably foreseeable.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         The  Company  is  subject to market  risk from  exposure  to changes in
interest rates based on its financing, investing and cash management activities.
The  Company  utilizes  a  credit  facility  to fund  seasonal  working  capital
requirements which is comprised primarily of variable rate debt.

         As of January 29, 1999,  the Company was a party to interest  rate swap
agreements  covering $200 million of its $225 million  leveraged  lease facility
and expiring  throughout  2008.  These swap  agreements  exchange the  Company's
floating  interest  rate exposure on the lease  payments  under its $225 million
leveraged  lease  facility  for fixed  rent  payments.  The  Company  will pay a
weighted  average  fixed  rate of 5.50%  on $200  million  of the  $225  million
facility  rather than the  one-month  LIBOR rate plus 0.13%,  which was 5.04% at
January 29, 1999. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was ($8.9)
million at January 29, 1999.

1.       Accounting Policies:

         The Company sells general  merchandise  on a retail basis through 3,687
         stores (as of January 29, 1999),  located  predominantly in small towns
         in the  midwestern  and  southeastern  United  States.  The Company has
         distribution  centers in Scottsville,  Kentucky;  Homerville,  Georgia;
         Ardmore,  Oklahoma;  South Boston,  Virginia;  Indianola,  Mississippi;
         Villa Rica, Georgia; Fulton, Missouri (under development); and Alachua,
         Florida (under development).

         Basis of presentation


         The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. The
         consolidated    financial    statements   include   all   subsidiaries.
         Inter-company transactions have been eliminated.


         Cash and cash equivalents

         Cash  and cash  equivalents  include  highly  liquid  investments  with
         original maturities of three months or less.

         Inventories

         Inventories  are  stated at cost using the  retail  last-in,  first-out
         ("LIFO") method which is not in excess of market. The excess of current
         cost over LIFO cost was $15.0 million,  $16.4 million and $18.4 million
         at  January  29,   1999,   January  30,  1998  and  January  31,  1997,
         respectively.  LIFO  reserves  decreased by $1.4 million in 1998,  $2.0
         million in 1997 and $2.2 million in 1996.

         Pre-opening costs

         Pre-opening costs for new stores are expensed as incurred.

         Property and equipment

         Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  The Company  provides for
         depreciation of buildings and equipment on a  straight-line  basis over
         the following  estimated useful lives: 40 years for buildings;  3 to 10
         years for furniture,  fixtures and equipment.  Depreciation expense was
         $52.9 million,  $38.5 million and $30.8 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
         respectively.

         Insurance claims provisions

         In 1996,  the  Company  established  The Greater  Cumberland  Insurance
         Company,  a Vermont-based,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  captive insurance
         company.  This insurance  company charges Dollar  General's  subsidiary
         companies competitive premium rates to insure workers' compensation and
         non-property  general  liability  claims risk.  The  insurance  company
         currently insures no unrelated third-party risk.

         The Company retains a significant  portion of the risk for its workers'
         compensation,  employee health insurance, general liability,  property,
         and  automobile  coverages.  Accordingly,  provisions  are made for the
         Company's  actuarially  determined estimates of discounted future claim
         costs for such risks.  To the extent that  subsequent  claim costs vary
         from those estimates, current earnings are charged or credited.

         Derivative financial instruments

         All  outstanding  interest rate swap agreements have been designated as
         hedges of the  Company's  commitment  under its $225 million  leveraged
         lease  facility.  The  Company  recognizes  interest  differentials  as
         adjustments to rent expense in the period they occur.  Gains and losses
         on terminations of interest rate swap agreements  would be deferred and
         amortized to rent expense over the shorter of the original  term of the
         agreements  or  the  remaining  life  of  the  associated   outstanding
         commitment. The counterparties to these instruments are major financial
         institutions.  The  fair 


         value of the Company's interest rate swap agreements is based on dealer
         quotes. These values represent the amounts the Company would receive or
         pay to  terminate  the  agreements  taking into  consideration  current
         interest rates. These counterparties  expose the Company to credit risk
         in  the  event  of  non-performance;  however,  the  Company  does  not
         anticipate  non-performance by the other parties.  The Company does not
         hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

         Income taxes

         The  Company  reports  income  taxes in  accordance  with SFAS No. 109,
         "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes."  Under  SFAS No.  109,  the asset and
         liability  method is used for computing  future income tax consequences
         of events  which have been  recognized  in the  Company's  consolidated
         financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax expense
         or  benefit is the change  during  the year in the  Company's  deferred
         income tax assets and liabilities.

         Management estimates

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
         date of the consolidated  financial statements and the reported amounts
         of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual results
         could differ from those estimates.

         Accounting pronouncements


         The Company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about  Segments of an
         Enterprise  and  Related  Information,"  during the  fiscal  year ended
         January 29, 1999. See Note 10.

         The company  adopted SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income,"
         during the fiscal  year ended  January  29,  1999.  Net income  equaled
         comprehensive income for 1998, 1997 and 1996.


2.       Cash and Short-term Borrowings:

         The cash management  system provides for daily  investment of available
         balances  and the  funding of  outstanding  checks when  presented  for
         payment. Investments in highly-rated,  short-term marketable securities
         totaling $15.0 million at January 29, 1999,  have been included in cash
         and cash  equivalents.  Outstanding  but  unpresented  checks  totaling
         $125.3  million and $65.5 million at January 29, 1999,  and January 30,
         1998,  respectively,  have been  included  in  accounts  payable.  Upon
         presentation  for payment,  they will be funded through  available cash
         balances or the Company's revolving credit/term loan agreement.

         The Company had  seasonal  lines of credit with banks  totaling  $165.0
         million at January 29,  1999,  and $175.0  million at January 30, 1998.
         The lines are  subject to periodic  review by the lending  institutions
         which may  increase or decrease  the amounts  available.  There were no
         borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at January 29, 1999,
         compared with $1.9 million outstanding at January 30, 1998.

         The  Company  also  has a $175.0  million  revolving  credit/term  loan
         agreement  which  expires in September  2002.  There were no borrowings
         under the revolver at January 29, 1999,  compared with $20.0 million at
         January  30,  1998.  Interest  rates on  amounts  borrowed  under  this
         agreement  can float with the prime  commercial  lending rate or can be
         fixed not to exceed the relevant adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.225%.

         The weighted average interest rates for all short-term  borrowings were
         5.5% and 5.7% at January 29, 1999, and January 30, 1998,  respectively.
         The  revolving  credit  loan  agreement  contains  certain  restrictive
         covenants.  At January 29, 1999, the Company was in compliance with all
         such covenants.

         At January 29, 1999, and January 30, 1998, the Company had  outstanding
         letters  of  credit   totaling   $101.1   million  and  $66.5  million,
         respectively.

3.       Accrued Expenses:

         Accrued expenses consist of the following:

         During 1998, the Company  entered into agreements to sell and leaseback
         the Ardmore, Oklahoma DC (including the expansion) and the expansion of
         its South  Boston,  Virginia DC. The Company  received cash advances on
         these sales prior to year end which are included in accrued expenses as
         of January 29,  1999.  Upon  completion  of the  construction  of these
         expansions, the Company will record the sales of these properties.

  4.     Income Taxes:

         The provision for taxes consists of the following:

         Deferred tax expense is recognized for the future tax  consequences  of
         temporary  differences  between the amounts  reported in the  Company's
         financial  statements and the tax basis of its assets and  liabilities.
         Differences  giving  rise to the  Company's  deferred  tax  assets  and
         liabilities are as follows:




          Reconciliation  of the federal statutory rate and the effective income
          tax rate follows:



5.       Earnings Per Share:

         Amounts  are in  thousands  except per share data and shares  have been
         adjusted to give retroactive effect to all common stock splits.

         Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing  income  available to
         common  shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
         stock  outstanding  during  the year.  Diluted  earnings  per share was
         determined based on the assumption that the convertible preferred stock
         was converted upon issuance on August 22, 1994.

6.       Commitments and Contingencies:

         During 1997, the Company  entered into a $100 million  leveraged  lease
         facility.  During 1998,  the  leveraged  lease  facility was amended to
         increase the amount of the facility to $225  million.  This facility is
         being used to fund the  construction  cost of the  Company's  corporate
         headquarters, two distribution centers and a number of store locations.
         The facility  expires in 2002 with renewal options through 2009.  Lease
         payments are calculated  based on the one-month  LIBOR plus 0.13%.  The
         lease  contains an option to purchase  these  properties up to one year
         prior to the  expiration  of the lease and  contains a  residual  value
         guarantee of $190 million.

         As of January 29, 1999,  the Company was a party to interest  rate swap
         agreements  covering $200 million of its $225 million  leveraged  lease
         facility and expiring  throughout 2008. These swap agreements  exchange
         the Company's  floating  interest  rate exposure on the lease  payments
         under  its  $225  million  leveraged  lease  facility  for  fixed  rent
         payments.  The Company will pay a weighted  average fixed rate of 5.50%
         on $200 million of the $225 million  facility rather than the one-month
         LIBOR rate plus 0.13%,  which was 5.04% at January 29,  1999.  The fair
         value of the  interest  rate swap  agreements  was  ($8.9)  million  at
         January 29, 1999.

         At  January  29,  1999,  the  Company  and  certain  subsidiaries  were
         committed  for retail  store,  distribution  center and  administrative
         office  space  in  the

         following fiscal years under non-cancelable operating lease agreements,
         including the leveraged lease facility, requiring minimum annual rental
         payments  of (in  millions):  $104.6 in 1999;  $90.5 in 2000;  $68.7 in
         2001;  $50.2 in 2002;  $36.6 in 2003 and $188.4 in later fiscal  years.
         Most leases  included  renewal  options for periods ranging from two to
         five  years  and  provisions  for  contingent   rentals  based  upon  a
         percentage of defined sales volume.

         Rent expense under all operating leases was as follows:

         The Company had $285.0  million in facilities at January 29, 1999,  and
         $260.0  million at January  30,  1998,  available  for the  issuance of
         letters of credit.

         The Company was  involved in  litigation,  investigations  of a routine
         nature and various  legal  matters  during  fiscal 1998 which are being
         defended  and handled in the  ordinary  course of  business.  While the
         ultimate  results of these  matters  cannot be determined or predicted,
         management  believes that they will not have a material  adverse affect
         on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

7.       Employee Benefits:

         Through December 31, 1997, the Company had two noncontributory  defined
         contribution  retirement  plans  covering  substantially  all full-time
         employees.  Expense for these plans was approximately  $4.9 million and
         $4.7 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

         Effective January 1, 1998, the Company established a 401(k) savings and
         retirement plan that replaced the previous defined  contribution plans.
         The assets of the defined  contribution  plans were merged into the new
         401(k) plan.  All employees who have completed 12 months of service and
         reached age 21 are eligible to participate in the plan. Under the plan,
         employees   can  make   contributions   up  to  15%  of  their   annual
         compensation.  Employee contributions, up to 6% of annual compensation,
         are  matched  by the  Company at the rate of $0.50 on the  dollar.  The
         Company also contributes  annually to the plan an amount equal to 2% of
         each  employee's  annual  compensation.   Expense  for  this  plan  was
         approximately $5.2 million in 1998.


         Effective  January 1, 1998, the Company also established a supplemental
         retirement plan and compensation  deferral plan for highly  compensated
         employees.  The  supplemental  retirement  plan  is  a  noncontributory
         defined  contribution  plan with annual Company  contributions  ranging
         from 2% to 12% of base pay plus bonus  depending upon age plus years of
         service and salary level.  Expense for this plan was approximately $0.4
         million in 1998. Under the compensation  deferral plan participants may
         defer  up to 50% of base  pay and 100% of  bonus  pay,  reduced  by any
         deferral to the 401(k) plan.

8.       Capital Stock:


         The  authorized  capital stock of the Company  consists of common stock
         and preferred stock. In June 1998, the Company increased the authorized
         shares of common stock to 500,000,000  shares and the authorized shares
         of preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares.


         On August 22, 1994, the Company exchanged  1,715,742 shares of Series A
         Convertible  Junior  Preferred Stock for the 8,578,710 shares of Dollar
         General common stock owned by C.T.S,  Inc., a personal  holding Company
         controlled  by members of the Turner  family,  the  founders  of Dollar
         General. The Series A Convertible Junior Preferred Stock was authorized
         by the Board of Directors out of the authorized but unissued  preferred
         stock  approved by the Company's  shareholders  in 1992.  The exchange,
         negotiated  and  recommended  by a special  committee of the  Company's
         Board of Directors,  came in response to a request from C.T.S,  Inc. to
         consider a  transaction  to meet  estate  planning  needs of the Turner
         family.  The  Series  A  Convertible  Junior  Preferred  Stock  is  (a)
         convertible  into common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions set
         forth in the Restated  Articles of Incorporation  and (b) is voted with
         the common  stock on all  matters  presented  to the  holders of common
         stock.  The Series A Convertible  Junior Preferred Stock is convertible
         at the option of the holder.  During the three years  following  August
         22,  1996,  the  conversion  ratio  increases  from 90% of the  initial
         exchange  ratio of five shares of common stock for each share of Series
         A  Convertible  Junior  Preferred  Stock  converted  (adjusted  for all
         intervening  stock  splits  or  adjustments)  to  100%  of the  initial
         exchange  ratio (as adjusted).  Additionally,  the Series A Convertible
         Junior  Preferred  Stock is not  transferable  by the holders  thereof,
         participates  in  dividends  paid on common  stock and is  entitled  to
         receive preferential payment in the event of liquidation.

9.       Stock Incentive Plans:

         The Company has  established  stock incentive plans under which options
         to  purchase  common  stock  may  be  granted  to  executive  officers,
         directors, key employees and non-employee directors.

         All options  granted in 1998,  1997 and 1996,  under the 1995  Employee
         Stock  Incentive  Plan, the 1993 Employee Stock  Incentive Plan and the
         1995 Outside  Directors  Stock Option Plan,  were  non-qualified  stock
         options  issued  at a price  equal  to the  fair  market  value  of the
         Company's  common  stock on the date of  grant.  Non-qualified  options
         granted under these plans have an expiration  date of no later than ten
         years  following the date of grant and have a vesting period of no less
         than one  year.  Although  these  plans  provide  for the  issuance  of
         incentive stock options, no such grants were made during the last three
         fiscal years.


         Under the plans,  grants are made to key management  employees  ranging
         from executive officers to store managers and assistant store managers,
         as well as other  employees as prescribed  by the  Company's  Corporate
         Governance and  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors.  The
         number of options granted and vesting  schedules are directly linked to
         the employee's  position within the Company,  achievement of individual
         performance  objectives  and the Company's  achievement of earnings per
         share goals.

         The plans also  provide  for annual  grants to  non-employee  directors
         according to a defined formula. The number of shares granted is tied to
         current director compensation levels and the market price of the stock.

         The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
         Employees,"  and related  interpretations  in accounting for its plans.
         The exercise price of options  awarded under these plans has been equal
         to the fair market value of the underlying  common stock on the date of
         grant. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
         stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's
         stock-based  compensation plans been determined based on the fair value
         at the grant date for awards  under  these  plans  consistent  with the
         methodology  prescribed under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
         Compensation,"  net  income  and  earnings  per share  would  have been
         reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table.




         Earnings per share have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to all
         common stock splits.

         The pro forma  effects on net  income  for 1998,  1997 and 1996 are not
         representative  of the pro forma  effect on net income in future  years
         because  they do not take into  consideration  pro  forma  compensation
         expense related to grants made prior to 1996. The fair value of options
         granted  during  1998,  1997  and 1996 is  $12.11,  $7.55,  and  $4.39,
         respectively.

         The fair value of each option  grant is  estimated on the date of grant
         using  the  Black-Scholes   option-pricing  model  with  the  following
         assumptions:



         A summary of the  balances and  activity  for all the  Company's  stock
         incentive plans for the last three fiscal years is presented below:

         The  following  table  summarizes   information   about  stock  options
outstanding at January 29, 1999:

         At  January  29,  1999,  there were  59,229,040  shares  available  for
         granting of stock options under the Company's stock option plans.

10.      SEGMENT REPORTING

         The  Company  manages  its  business  on the  basis  of one  reportable
         segment.  See Note 1 for a brief description of the Company's business.
         As of January 29, 1999,  all of the  Company's  operations  are located
         within the United States. The following data is presented in accordance
         with SFAS No. 131 which the Company has  retroactively  adopted for all
         periods presented.



11.      QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED):

         The following is selected  unaudited  quarterly  financial data for the
         fiscal years ended January 29, 1999, and January 30, 1998.  Amounts are
         in thousands  except per share data.  Per share data has been  adjusted
         for all common stock splits.



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Dollar General Corporation
Nashville, Tennessee


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balances sheets of Dollar General
Corporation  and  subsidiaries  as of January 29, 1999 and January 30, 1998, and
the related consolidated  statements of income,  shareholders'  equity, and cash
flows for the years then ended. These consolidated  financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  consolidated  financial  statements  based on our audits.  The
consolidated  financial statements of the Company for the year ended January 31,
1997 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated March 5, 1997, expressed
an unqualified opinion on those statements.


We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable  assurance about whether the  consolidated  financial  statements are
free of material  misstatement.  An audit includes  examining,  on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and disclosures in the  consolidated  financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
consolidated  financial  statement  presentation.  We  believe  that our  audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 1998 and 1997 consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dollar

1998,  and the results of its  operations  and its cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors
Dollar General Corporation
Nashville, Tennessee


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Dollar General
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of January 31, 1997 and the related consolidated
statements  of income,  shareholders'  equity,  and cash flows for the year then
ended.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the consolidated  financial  position of Dollar General
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of January 31, 1997 and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two fiscal years in the
period ended January 31, 1997 in conformity with generally  accepted  accounting
principles.
