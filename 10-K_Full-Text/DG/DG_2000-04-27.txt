                                     PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

General

         Dollar General  Corporation  (the  "Company" or "Dollar  General") is a
discount retailer of quality general merchandise at everyday low prices. Through
conveniently   located   neighborhood  stores,  the  Company  offers  a  focused
assortment of consumable  basic  merchandise  including  health and beauty aids,
packaged food products,  cleaning  supplies,  housewares,  stationery,  seasonal
goods,  basic  apparel  and  domestics.   During  1999,  hardline  and  softline
merchandise accounted for 82% and 18% of net sales, respectively. Dollar General
Stores serve primarily low-,  middle- and fixed- income families.  As of January
28, 2000, the Company  operated 4,294 stores located in 24 states,  primarily in
the midwestern and southeastern United States.

         The Company opened its first Dollar  General store in 1955.  During the
last  five  years,  the  Company  has  experienced  a rapid  rate  of  expansion
increasing  its number of stores from 2,059 stores with an estimated  12,726,000
selling  square  feet at January 31,  1995,  to 4,294  stores with an  estimated
28,655,000  selling  square feet at January 28, 2000. In addition to growth from
new store openings,  the Company  recorded  same-store  sales increases in 1997,
1998 and 1999 of 8.4%, 8.3% and 6.4%,  respectively.  For the years 1995 through
1999, the Company had a compound  annual growth rate in net sales and net income
of  21.8%  and  24.4%,  respectively.   In  2000,  the  Company  plans  to  open
approximately 675-700 new stores. The Company's business is somewhat seasonal in
nature.  As a result of the  holiday  season,  the  Company's  net sales and net
income are slightly higher in the fourth quarter than other quarters.

Business Strategy

         Dollar General's  mission statement is "A Better Life for Everyone!" To
carry out this  mission,  the Company has  developed  a business  strategy  that
focuses on providing its customers with a focused assortment of consumable basic
merchandise in a convenient, small-store format.

         Our  Customers.  The  Company  serves the  consumable  basics  needs of
customers  primarily  in the  low- and  fixed-  income  brackets.  Specifically,
two-thirds  of the  Company's  customers  live in  households  earning less than
$30,000 a year; nearly half earn less than $20,000. The Company believes that it
is well positioned to meet the consumable  basics needs of the increasing number
of households in this group.

         Our Stores. Dollar General Stores average 6,700 selling square feet and
are usually  located  within three to five miles of our customers'  homes.  This
appeals to the Company's target  customers,  many of whom prefer the convenience
of a small, neighborhood store. As the discount store industry continues to move
toward  larger,  "super-center"  type stores  which are often  built  outside of
towns,  Dollar General's  convenient  discount store format has become even more
appealing to a wider range of consumers.

         Our  Merchandise.  The  Company  is  committed  to  offering  a focused
assortment  of  quality,  consumable  basic  merchandise  in a  number  of  core
categories  such as health and beauty aids,  packaged  food  products,  cleaning
supplies, housewares,  stationery,  seasonal goods, basic apparel and domestics.
By consistently  offering a focused  assortment of consumable basic merchandise,
the  Company  encourages  customers  to shop  Dollar  General  Stores  for their
everyday  household needs,  leading to frequent  customer  visits.  In 1999, the
average customer transaction increased to $8.14 from $8.06 in 1998.

         Our  Prices.  The  Company   distributes   quality,   consumable  basic
merchandise at everyday low prices. The Company's  low-cost operating  structure
and focused assortment of merchandise allow it to offer quality merchandise with
compelling value. As part of this strategy,  the Company emphasizes  even-dollar
price  points.  The majority of products are



priced at $10 or less, with nearly 50% of the products priced at $1 or less. The
most expensive items are generally priced at $35.

         Our Cost Controls.  The Company maintains strict overhead cost controls
and seeks to locate  stores in  neighborhoods  where store rental and  operating
costs are low. The Company  continues to utilize new technology where it is cost
effective to improve operating efficiencies.

Growth Strategy

         Management  believes that the Company's  future growth will come from a
combination of merchandising  initiatives,  new store growth and  infrastructure
investments.

         Merchandising Initiatives.  In 1998, the Company introduced a series of
family-oriented  basic apparel  programs to its stores.  These programs  include
jeans, khakis, T-shirts and knit shirts for men, women and children at prices of
$10 or less.  These  programs  increase the  selection of quality  basic apparel
without  increasing  the square  footage  allocation  of  softline  merchandise.
Reflecting  customer  research  findings,  the  Company  introduced  several new
national brand items in key consumable  categories in 1999. In 2000, the Company
plans to expand the selection of store brands and take  advantage of opportunity
purchases that reflect its consumable  basic strategy.  The Company also intends
to utilize new  plan-o-gram  technology to improve  inventory  productivity  and
retrofit  approximately  700 small stores to a more  productive  prototype.  The
Company will continue to evaluate the  performance of its consumable  categories
and make changes where  appropriate.  The Company  believes these  merchandising
initiatives  have  contributed and will continue to contribute to same-store net
sales increases.

         New Store Growth. The Company believes its format is adaptable to towns
and neighborhoods throughout the country. The Company currently serves more than
2,800 communities with populations of fewer than 25,000. According to the Census
Bureau,  there are  approximately  18,000 such communities in the United States.
The Company will continue to focus on towns and neighborhoods within its current
24-state  market  area  where  management  believes  that  the  Company  has the
potential to  significantly  expand its store base. By opening new stores in its
existing market area, the Company  leverages brand awareness and takes advantage
of  operating  efficiencies.  In  addition,  the Company  expects to explore the
potential  for  geographic   expansion  as  opportunities   present  themselves.
Currently, the Company targets an annual new store sales growth rate of at least
14% per year. In 2000, the Company plans to open 675-700 new stores and relocate
an additional 200-250 stores.

         Infrastructure  Investments.  The Company continues to make significant
investments in infrastructure.  Management  believes that these investments will
enable the Company to aggressively  grow its store base and continually  improve
its operating  margin.  The Company realizes  significant  cost  efficiencies by
locating stores in close proximity to its distribution  centers ("DCs").  During
1999, the Company completed  construction of a new 1.2 million square foot DC in
Fulton,  Missouri and completed  expansions to its existing DCs in South Boston,
Virginia and Ardmore,  Oklahoma.  The Company plans to open a 1.0 million square
foot DC in Alachua,  Florida in the second half of 2000 and a 1.2 million square
foot DC in  Zanesville,  Ohio in the first half of 2001.  The  Company  plans to
close its Homerville, Georgia DC in 2000. Most of the stores currently served by
the Homerville,  Georgia will  ultimately be served by the Alachua,  Florida DC.
These changes will bring the Company's total distribution space to approximately
7.9 million square feet in eight facilities by the end of 2001.



Merchandise

         Dollar General Stores offer a focused assortment of quality, consumable
basic  merchandise  in a number  of core  categories.  In 1999,  national  brand
merchandise represented more than 50% of net sales an increase from 35% in 1998.

         The Company believes that its merchandising strategy generates frequent
repeat customer traffic. The Company is able to offer everyday low prices to its
customers in large part because its buying staff  negotiates low purchase prices
from suppliers.  The Company  purchases its  merchandise  from a wide variety of
suppliers,  with no  supplier  accounting  for  more  than  6% of the  Company's
purchases during 1999.

         In order to fulfill the Company's  commitment to maintain high in-stock
levels of core merchandise, the Company generally limits its stock keeping units
("SKUs")  per store to  approximately  3,500  items.  The  majority of items are
priced at $1 and in increments of $1, with the most  expensive  items  generally
priced at $35. The Company believes  even-dollar  pricing  demonstrates value to
the customer and  disciplines  its merchants to continually  negotiate  purchase
prices that  conform to a limited  number of retail  price  points.  The Company
believes the risk of inventory  obsolescence  is low because it offers  quality,



consumable basic  merchandise.  The Company  regularly  reviews its inventory to
identify  aged  merchandise  and  sells it at  reduced  prices to remove it from
inventory.

Dollar General Stores receive merchandise shipments weekly from Company DCs. See
"Item 2. -- Properties."



The Dollar General Store

         The typical Dollar General Store has approximately 6,700 square feet of
selling space and is operated by a manager, an assistant manager and two or more
sales clerks.  Approximately 71% of the Dollar General Stores are in communities
with  populations  of fewer than 25,000  people.  As of January 28, 2000, 60% of
stores were located in strip shopping centers,  35% were freestanding  buildings
and 5%  were  in  downtown  store  buildings.  The  Company  generally  has  not
encountered  difficulty  locating  suitable  store  sites in the  past,  and the
Company  does  not  currently  anticipate  experiencing  difficulty  in  finding
suitable locations.

         The Company's recent store growth is summarized in the following table:

                     Stores at                              Net

Employees

         At  March  31,  2000,  the  Company  and  its   subsidiaries   employed
approximately  34,600  full-time and  part-time  employees,  including  regional
managers,   district  managers,   store  managers,  and  DC  and  administrative
personnel,  compared with approximately  29,800 employees at March 31, 1999. The
Company believes its relationship with its employees is good.

Competition

         The Company is engaged in a highly  competitive  business.  The Company
competes  with discount  stores and with many other  retailers,  including  mass
merchandise,  grocery,  drug,  convenience,  variety and other specialty stores.
Some of the largest retail  companies have stores in some of the areas where the
Company  operates.  Management  believes that the Company competes  primarily by
offering  quality,  consumable  basic  merchandise  at  everyday  low  prices in
convenient neighborhood locations.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

         This discussion and analysis  contains  historical and  forward-looking
information. The forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company
believes  the  assumptions  underlying  these  forward-looking   statements  are
reasonable;  however, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore,
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements as a result of certain risks and  uncertainties,  including,  but not
limited to, general  transportation  and distribution  delays or  interruptions,
inventory  risks due to  shifts  in  market  demand,  changes  in  product  mix,
interruptions in suppliers' business, fuel price and interest rate fluctuations,



and costs and  delays  associated  with  building,  opening  and  operating  new
distribution centers ("DCs") and stores. The Company undertakes no obligation to
publicly  release any  revisions  to any  forward-looking  statements  contained
herein to  reflect  events  or  circumstances  occurring  after the date of this
report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

         The following text contains  references to years 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998
and 1997 which represent fiscal years ending February 1, 2002, February 2, 2001,
January 28, 2000,  January 29, 1999,  and January 30, 1998,  respectively.  This
discussion  and analysis  should be read with,  and is qualified in its entirety
by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.



General

         During  1999,  Dollar  General  achieved  record sales and earnings and
continued  its rapid pace of new store  openings.  From 1995 through  1999,  the
Company had a compound annual growth rate of 21.8% in net sales and 24.4% in net
income.

         For the  twelfth  consecutive  year,  the Company  increased  its total
number of store units. The Company opened 646 new stores in 1999,  compared with
551 in 1998 and 468 in 1997.  In 1999,  the Company  remodeled or relocated  409
stores,  compared with 351 in 1998 and 195 in 1997. During the last three years,
the Company has opened,  remodeled or relocated  2,620  stores,  accounting  for
approximately  60% of the total stores as of January 28, 2000. The Company ended
the year with 4,294 stores. In 2000, the Company  anticipates opening 675 to 700
new stores and relocating  approximately 200 to 250 existing stores. The Company
will continue to focus on opening stores within 200 miles of its DCs.

         The 1999 new stores and relocations,  net of 39 closed stores, added an
aggregate of  approximately  5.0 million  selling  square feet to the  Company's
total sales space, providing the Company with an aggregate of approximately 28.7
million  selling  square feet at the end of the year. The average store measured
approximately 6,700 selling square feet in 1999 and 6,400 selling square feet in
1998 and 1997.

         In 1998,  the Company  introduced  a preferred  development  program to
support continued new store growth.  This program enables the Company to partner
with  established  development  firms to build stores in markets where existing,
acceptable  retail  space is  unavailable.  The  Company  opened  141 new stores
through this program in 1999,  compared with 50 new stores in 1998. In 2000, the
Company plans to open approximately 200 preferred  development  stores. In 1999,
the average size of a new preferred development store increased to approximately
7,700 selling square feet from 6,500 in 1998.

         In the  second  quarter  of  1999,  the  Company  completed  a  450,000
square-foot expansion of its Ardmore, Oklahoma DC. In the third quarter of 1999,
the Company opened its seventh DC, a 1.2 million square foot facility located in
Fulton,  Missouri. This opening was achieved with minimal disruption to the flow
of  merchandise  to stores.  The Company  plans to open an eighth DC in Alachua,
Florida in the second half of 2000.  Continuing  to support its rapidly  growing
store base and improving distribution efficiencies,  the Company intends to open
its ninth DC in Zanesville, Ohio in the first half of 2001.

         During 1999, the Company  developed a new DC merchandise  replenishment
system,  expanded  electronic data interchange  capabilities and installed a new
transportation management system to improve routing and loading efficiencies. In
2000,  the  Company  will  begin  the  two-year  implementation  of a new  store
technology  platform.  In the first half of 2000,  the Company  plans to install
faster,  more reliable flatbed scanners in all stores.  In the second quarter of
2000, the Company expects to begin a register  replacement  program for existing
stores. The Company plans to install new registers in approximately 1,700 stores
in 2000 and in all remaining stores in 2001. The Company also plans to establish
a perpetual  inventory system in  approximately  75% of its stores by year-end .
These  upgrades  will  enable the  Company  to gather  more  accurate  sales and
inventory  information  and to expand the  utilization  of  automatic  inventory
replenishment.  In addition to replacing several  administrative legacy systems,
the Company  will also  upgrade its  financial  and human  resources  systems to
improve processes and enhance reporting capabilities.

Results of Operations

         Net Sales.  Net sales totaled $3.89 billion for 1999, $3.22 billion for
1998 and $2.63  billion for 1997.  These totals  represent  annual  increases of
20.7% in 1999,  22.6% in 1998 and 23.1% in 1997.  These increases  resulted from
607 net new stores and a same-store  net sales increase of 6.4% in 1999; 518 net
new stores and a same-store  net sales increase of 8.3% in 1998; and 435 net new
stores and a  same-store  net sales  increase of 8.4% in 1997.  The  increase in
same-store sales for 1999 resulted from continued  improvements in the Company's
consumable basic  merchandise mix and improved  in-stock levels.  The same-store
sales   increase  for  1998  was  primarily   driven  by  the  addition  of  700
faster-turning  consumable  items to the merchandise mix and  refurbishing  more
than 2,400 stores to a new prototype  reflecting a 65%  hardlines/35%  softlines
space  allocation  versus the previous 50%/50%  allocation.  The Company defines



same-stores  as those stores which were opened before the beginning of the prior
fiscal year and which have remained open  throughout  both the prior and current
fiscal years. In 2000, management anticipates total sales will increase at least
20% and same store sales will increase 5 to 7%.

         Gross  Profit.  Gross profit for 1999 was $1.10  billion  compared with
$905.9 million in 1998 and $742.1 million in 1997.  Gross profit as a percentage
of net sales was 28.2% for 1999 compared with 28.1% for 1998 and 28.3% for 1997.
The 1999 result includes an increase in distribution  expense as a percentage of
net sales, reflecting higher occupancy costs due to operating one additional DC.
This increase was partially  offset by lower markdowns and inventory  shrinkage,
both as a  percentage  of net sales.  The 1998  result  reflects  an increase in
inventory  shrinkage  as a percentage  of net sales  offset  slightly by reduced
distribution expense as a percentage of net sales and higher initial mark-up. In
1999,  inventory  shrinkage was 2.2% of net sales compared with 2.5% in 1998 and
2.2% in  1997.  In 2000,  management  anticipates  gross  margin  will  decrease
slightly reflecting higher DC expense associated with operating an additional DC
and lower initial markup on purchases.

         Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Total selling, general and
administrative  ("SG&A") expense as a percentage of net sales was 19.3% in 1999,
compared with 19.1% in 1998 and 19.3% in 1997.  SG&A expense for 1999 was $748.5
million,  compared  with $616.6  million in 1998 and $506.6  million in 1997. In
1999,  the higher SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales  resulted  primarily
from  higher  store  labor  and rent  expense.  In  1998,  the  lower  SG&A as a
percentage of net sales  resulted  primarily  from (a) lower  advertising  costs
through the  elimination  of the  December  direct-mail  circular  and (b) lower
employee  incentive  compensation  offset  slightly  by an  increase in workers'
compensation  expense.  All other SG&A expense categories as a percentage of net
sales remained relatively flat. In 2000, management  anticipates leveraging SG&A
expense  as a  percentage  of net sales  resulting  in a modest  improvement  in
operating margin.

         Interest Expense.  In 1999,  interest expense was $5.2 million compared
with $8.3  million in 1998 and $3.8  million  in 1997.  The  decreased  interest
expense in 1999 resulted primarily from lower average short-term borrowings as a
result of cash received from sale/leasebacks.  The increased interest expense in
1998 resulted primarily from increased short-term borrowings used to finance the
additional  inventory  required to supply two new DCs and 518 net new stores and
from the timing of the Company's repurchase of common stock. Daily average total
debt outstanding equaled $132.9 million during 1999 compared with $153.2 million
in 1998 and $74.8 million in 1997. Management expects that interest expense as a
percentage  of net  sales for 2000 will be  higher  reflecting  increased  costs
associated with financing greater capital expenditures.

         Provision for Taxes on Income. The effective income tax rates for 1999,
1998 and 1997 were 36.2%, 35.2% and 37.6%, respectively.  The effective tax rate
decreased  between 1997 and 1999 primarily as a result of effective tax planning
strategies.  The 1998  effective  tax rate also  reflects a one-time tax benefit
resulting from the change of state of  incorporation to Tennessee from Kentucky.
Management  anticipates  the  effective  tax rate  for 2000 to be  approximately
36.2%.

         Net Income.  For the fourth consecutive year, the Company increased net
income by more than 20%. In 1999,  net income  totaled  $219.4  million (a 20.5%
increase),  compared with $182.0  million (a 25.9%  increase) in 1998 and $144.6
million (a 25.6% increase) in 1997. In 2000, management  anticipates earnings to
increase at least 20%.

         Return on  Equity  and  Assets.  The  ratio of net  income  to  average
shareholders' equity was 26.6% in 1999, compared with 27.8% in 1998 and 27.0% in
1997. Return on average assets was 16.5% in 1999 compared with 17.1% in 1998 and
17.7% in 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         Working Capital.  Working capital  increased to $623.2 million in 1999,
compared with $423.8  million in 1998 and $359.0  million in 1997.  The ratio of
current assets to current liabilities  (current ratio) was 2.3 in 1999, compared
with 1.9 in 1998 and 2.2 in 1997.

         Cash Flows from  Operating  Activities.  Net cash provided by operating
activities was $140.4 million in 1999,  compared with $218.6 million in 1998 and
$139.1  million  in 1997.  This  decrease  in net cash was  primarily  driven by
decreased accrued expenses as a result of the advances received in 1998 from the
sale/leasebacks  of the South  Boston,  Virginia DC  expansion  and the Ardmore,
Oklahoma  DC. In 1998,  the  increased  cash  generated  from net income  before



depreciation and deferred taxes was offset partially by the increased  inventory
levels required to stock the Indianola, Mississippi and Villa Rica, Georgia DCs,
the 518 net new stores and the new basic apparel program.

         Cash Flows from  Investing  Activities.  Capital  expenditures  in 1999
totaled $152.7 million,  compared with $140.3 million in 1998 and $107.7 million
in 1997. The Company opened 646 new stores and relocated or remodeled 409 stores
at a cost of $74.4 million in 1999. Capital  expenditures for new, relocated and
remodeled  stores  totaled $61.6 million and $39.4 million during 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

         Distribution-related  capital  expenditures  totaled  $43.2  million in
1999,  resulting  primarily from costs  associated  with the 450,000 square foot
expansion of the Ardmore, Oklahoma DC and the purchase of new delivery trailers.
In 1998, the Company spent $45.9 million, primarily on costs associated with the
484,000 square foot expansion of the South Boston,  Virginia DC and the purchase
of new delivery trailers. In 1997, the Company spent $26.2 million, primarily on
costs  associated  with the  expansion of the  Scottsville,  Kentucky DC and the
purchase of new delivery trailers.

         During 1998, the Company  entered into agreements to sell and leaseback
the Ardmore,  Oklahoma DC  (including  the  expansion)  and the expansion of the
South  Boston,  Virginia DC. The Company  received  cash advances on these sales
which were included in accrued expenses as of January 29, 1999. During 1999, the
construction  of these  expansions  was completed  and the Company  recorded the
sales of these properties.

         Capital  expenditures  during 2000 are  projected  to be  approximately
$270-280  million.  This  includes  approximately  $202  million for new stores,
remodels  and  relocations,  including  $122  million  for the  construction  of
company-owned stores; approximately $18 million for upgrading existing stores to
the new technology  platform;  and approximately $17 million for  transportation
equipment and logistics technology. The Company anticipates funding 2000 capital
expenditures  with cash flow from  operations,  borrowings under existing credit
facilities and potential future financings.

         Cash Flows from  Financing  Activities.  Total debt at January 28, 2000
(including  current  maturities  and  short-term  borrowings)  was $2.4 million,
compared with $1.5 million in 1998 and $24.7 million in 1997.  Long-term debt at
January 28, 2000 was $1.2 million,  compared with $0.8 million for 1998 and $1.3
million for 1997. The average daily  short-term debt was $132.9 million in 1999,
compared with $153.2  million in 1998 and $74.8 million in 1997. The Company was
able to pay off all short-term  borrowings at year-end with internally generated
funds.

         Because of the significant impact of seasonal buying (e.g.,  spring and
December holiday  purchases),  the Company's  working capital  requirements vary
significantly  during the year. In 1999, these working capital requirements were
financed by short-term  borrowings  under the Company's  $175 million  revolving
credit  agreement (the  "revolver")  and seasonal bank lines of credit  totaling
$105 million at January 28, 2000. The Company's maximum  outstanding  short-term
indebtedness  in 1999 was $218.8 million in November 1999,  compared with $312.6
million in October 1998. Seasonal bank lines of credit are subject to renewal on
various dates throughout 2000, and the Company currently  anticipates that these
agreements  will be renewed.  Management  believes  the  existing  revolver  and
seasonal bank lines will be sufficient to fund its working capital  requirements
in 2000.

         In 1999, the Company repurchased 2,213,400 shares of common stock at an
average cost of $22.93 per share. Under the current authorization from the Board
of Directors,  the Company can repurchase  approximately 4.0 million  additional
shares.

Market Risk

         The  Company  is  subject to market  risk from  exposure  to changes in
interest rates based on its financing, investing and cash management activities.
The  Company  utilizes  a  credit  facility  to fund  seasonal  working  capital
requirements  which  is  comprised  of  variable  rate  debt.  See  "Item  7A  -
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.".

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

         The Company  believes  that  inflation  and/or  deflation had a minimal
impact on its overall operations during 1999, 1998 and 1997. In particular,  the
effect of  deflation  on cost of goods sold has been minimal as reflected by the
small fluctuations in LIFO reserves in 1999, 1998 and 1997.



Accounting Pronouncements

         The Company  will adopt  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards
(SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
for the fiscal  year ending  February 1, 2002.  The Company is in the process of
analyzing the impact of the adoption of this Statement.

Year 2000

         To date,  the Company has not  experienced  any major  computer  system
problems or  interruptions  of its  business  related to Year 2000  issues.  The
Company's Year 2000 remedial efforts cost approximately  $510,000.  This expense
excludes  the  costs of  previously  planned  software  implementations  and the
salaries of existing employees involved in the Year 2000 remedial efforts. Costs
were  expensed  when  incurred.  Although  the Company does not  anticipate  any
material future problems related to Year 2000 issues, there is no guarantee that
such problems will not arise in the future. The Company does, however,  maintain
a  comprehensive  business  continuity  plan that addresses  potential  business
interruptions such as the occurrence of unidentified Year 2000 issues.


ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         With certain  instruments entered into for other than trading purposes,
the Company has exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates  primarily
related to the  company's  revolving  and  seasonal  lines of credit and certain
lease obligations.  Under these obligations,  the Company has cash flow exposure
due to its variable interest rates.

         The Company  seeks to manage this interest rate risk through the use of
interest  rate swaps.  In 1999,  the Company  entered  into  interest  rate swap
agreements  totaling  $200 million  which are  scheduled to be in place  through
February 2001 at which time,  the  counterparties  have the option to extend the
agreements  through 2002. These swap agreements  exchange the Company's floating
interest rate exposure to a fixed interest rate. The Company will pay a weighted
average fixed rate of 5.14% on the $200 million notional amount.  The fair value
of the interest rate swap agreements was $3.1 million at January 28, 2000. These
swap  agreements  replaced  four  interest  rate swap  agreements  totaling $200
million and  exchanging  floating  rate  exposure to a fixed  interest  rate. At
January 29, 1999, the fair market value of the interest rate swap agreements was
($8.9) million.

         A 1% change in interest rates would have resulted in a pre-tax  expense
fluctuation  of  approximately  $3.6  million and $1.5 million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively.  In 2000, the Company does not anticipate this expense fluctuation
to vary materially from the estimated impact on 1999.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.       Accounting Policies:

         The Company sells general  merchandise  on a retail basis through 4,294
         stores (as of January 28, 2000),  located  predominantly in small towns
         in the midwestern and southeastern  United States.  The Company has DCs
         in Scottsville, Kentucky; Homerville, Georgia; Ardmore, Oklahoma; South
         Boston, Virginia; Indianola,  Mississippi; Villa Rica, Georgia; Fulton,
         Missouri;  Alachua,  Florida (under  development) and Zanesville,  Ohio
         (under development).

         Basis of presentation

         The Company's fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. The
         consolidated    financial    statements   include   all   subsidiaries.
         Inter-company    transactions    have    been    eliminated.    Certain
         reclassifications  have  been  made  to the  1998  and  1997  financial
         statements to agree to the 1999 presentation.

         Cash and cash equivalents

         Cash  and cash  equivalents  include  highly  liquid  investments  with
         original maturities of three months or less when purchased.

         Inventories

         Inventories  are  stated at cost using the  retail  last-in,  first-out
         ("LIFO") method which is not in excess of market. The excess of current
         cost over LIFO cost was $15.2 million,  $15.0 million and $16.4 million
         at  January  28,   2000,   January  29,  1999  and  January  30,  1998,
         respectively.  LIFO  reserves  increased  by $0.2  million  in 1999 but
         decreased $1.4 million in 1998 and $2.0 million in 1997.

         Pre-opening costs

         Pre-opening costs for new stores are expensed as incurred.

         Property and equipment

         Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  The Company  provides for
         depreciation of buildings and equipment on a  straight-line  basis over
         the following  estimated useful lives: 40 years for buildings;  3 to 10
         years for furniture,  fixtures and equipment.  Depreciation expense was
         $63.4 million,  $52.9 million and $38.5 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
         respectively.

         Insurance claims provisions

         In 1996,  the  Company  established  The Greater  Cumberland  Insurance
         Company,  a Vermont-based,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  captive insurance
         company.  This insurance  company charges Dollar  General's  subsidiary
         companies competitive premium rates to insure workers' compensation and
         non-property  general  liability  claims risk.  The  insurance  company
         currently insures no unrelated third-party risk.

         The Company retains a significant  portion of the risk for its workers'
         compensation,  employee health insurance, general liability,  property,
         and  automobile  coverages.  Accordingly,  provisions  are made for the
         Company's  actuarially  determined estimates of discounted future claim
         costs for such risks.  To the extent that  subsequent  claim costs vary
         from those estimates, current earnings are charged or credited.

         Derivative financial instruments

         On July 16, 1999, the Company replaced its existing  interest rate swap
         agreements  with $200 million in interest rate swap  agreements.  These
         agreements  contain  provisions  to extend the  agreements to September
         2002,  which can be  exercised at the option of the  counterparties  in
         February  2001.  The Company will pay a weighted  average fixed rate of
         5.14% on the $200 million  notional  amount.  All outstanding  interest
         rate swap  agreements  have been  designated as hedges of the Company's
         floating  rate  commitments   under  operating   leases.   The  Company
         recognizes  floating  rate interest  differentials  as  adjustments  to
         expense in the period they occur.  Gains and losses on  terminations of
         interest  rate swap  agreements  are deferred and  amortized to expense



         over  the  shorter  of  the  original  term  of the  agreements  or the
         remaining  life  of  the   associated   outstanding   commitment.   The
         counterparties to these  instruments are major financial  institutions.
         These counterparties  expose the Company to credit risk in the event of
         non-performance;    however,    the   Company   does   not   anticipate
         non-performance  by the other parties.  The fair value of the Company's
         interest rate swap  agreements is based on dealer quotes.  These values
         represent the amounts the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
         agreements taking into  consideration  current interest rates. The fair
         value of the interest rate swap  agreements was $3.1 million at January
         28,  2000.  The  Company  does not hold or issue  derivative  financial
         instruments for trading purposes.

         Income taxes

         The  Company  reports  income  taxes in  accordance  with SFAS No. 109,
         "Accounting  for  Income  Taxes."  Under  SFAS No.  109,  the asset and
         liability  method is used for computing  future income tax consequences
         of events  which have been  recognized  in the  Company's  consolidated
         financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax expense
         or  benefit is the change  during  the year in the  Company's  deferred
         income tax assets and liabilities.

         Management estimates

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally
         accepted  accounting  principles  requires management to make estimates
         and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and
         liabilities and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
         date of the consolidated  financial statements and the reported amounts
         of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual results
         could differ from those estimates.

         Accounting pronouncements

         The Company  will adopt  Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards
         (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
         Activities,"  for the fiscal year ending  February 1, 2002. The Company
         is in the  process  of  analyzing  the impact of the  adoption  of this
         Statement.


2.       Cash and Short-term Borrowings:

         The cash management  system provides for daily  investment of available
         balances  and the  funding of  outstanding  checks when  presented  for
         payment. Outstanding but unpresented checks totaling $127.5 million and
         $125.3 million at January 28, 2000, and January 29, 1999, respectively,
         have been included in accounts payable.  Upon presentation for payment,
         they will be funded  through  available  cash balances or the Company's
         revolving credit agreement (the "revolver").

         The Company had  seasonal  lines of credit with banks  totaling  $105.0
         million at January 28,  2000,  and $165.0  million at January 29, 1999.
         The lines are  subject to periodic  review by the lending  institutions
         which may  increase or decrease  the amounts  available.  There were no
         borrowings  outstanding under these lines of credit at January 28, 2000
         and January 29, 1999.  The Company also has a $175.0  million  revolver
         which expires in September 2002.  There were no borrowings  outstanding
         under the revolver at January 28, 2000 and January 29, 1999.

         The weighted average interest rates for all short-term  borrowings were
         5.7% and 5.5% for 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The revolver  contains
         certain restrictive covenants.  At January 28, 2000, the Company was in
         compliance with all such covenants.

         At January 28, 2000, and January 29, 1999, the Company had  outstanding
         letters  of  credit   totaling   $53.6  million  and  $101.1   million,
         respectively.





3.       Accrued Expenses:

         Accrued expenses consist of the following:




         Deferred tax expense is recognized for the future tax  consequences  of
         temporary  differences  between the amounts  reported in the  Company's
         financial  statements and the tax basis of its assets and  liabilities.
         Differences  giving  rise to the  Company's  deferred  tax  assets  and
         liabilities are as follows:





Reconciliation  of the federal  statutory rate and the effective income tax rate
follows:


5.       Earnings Per Share:

         Amounts are in  thousands  except per share data,  and shares have been
         adjusted to give retroactive effect to all common stock splits.





         Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing  income  available to
         common  shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
         stock  outstanding  during  the year.  Diluted  earnings  per share was
         determined based on the assumption that the convertible preferred stock
         was converted upon issuance on August 22, 1994.


6.       Commitments and Contingencies:

         At  January  28,  2000,  the  Company  and  certain  subsidiaries  were
         committed for retail store, DC and  administrative  office space in the
         following fiscal years under non-cancelable  operating lease agreements
         requiring  minimum annual rental  payments of (in millions):  $149.5 in
         2000;  $129.1 in 2001; $111.1 in 2002; $64.0 in 2003; $50.1 in 2004 and
         $181.8 in later  fiscal  years.  Most of these leases  include  renewal
         options for periods  ranging from two to five years and  provisions for
         contingent  rentals  based upon a percentage  of defined  sales volume.
         Certain leases contain restrictive covenants.  At January 28, 2000, the
         Company was in compliance with such covenants.

         Rent expense under all operating leases was as follows:

         (In thousands)                  1999          1998           1997
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

         Minimum rentals                $135,703     $101,235       $71,694
         Contingent rentals               13,646       13,658        12,342

         -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         Total rentals                  $149,349     $114,893       $84,036
         =======================================================================


         Included  in  the  leases  above,  the  Company  leases  its  corporate
         headquarters,  certain  DCs  and a  number  of  store  locations  under
         operating  leases which contain a residual  value  guarantees of $351.4



         million.  Lease  payments  are based on variable  interest  rates.  The
         Company  had $285.0  million in  facilities  at January 28,  2000,  and
         January  29,  1999,  available  for the  issuance  of trade  letters of
         credit.

         The Company was  involved in  litigation,  investigations  of a routine
         nature and various legal matters during 1999,  which are being defended
         and handled in the  ordinary  course of  business.  While the  ultimate
         results of these matters cannot be determined or predicted,  management
         believes  that  they  will not have a  material  adverse  affect on the
         Company's results of operations or financial position.


7.       Employee Benefits:

         Through December 31, 1997, the Company had two noncontributory  defined
         contribution  retirement  plans  covering  substantially  all full-time
         employees.  Expense for these plans was  approximately  $4.9 million in
         1997.

         Effective January 1, 1998, the Company established a 401(k) savings and
         retirement plan that replaced the previous defined  contribution plans.
         The assets of the defined  contribution  plans were merged into the new
         401(k) plan.  All employees who have completed 12 months of service and
         reached age 21 are eligible to participate in the plan. Under the plan,



         employees   can  make   contributions   up  to  15%  of  their   annual
         compensation.  Employee contributions, up to 6% of annual compensation,
         are  matched  by the  Company at the rate of $0.50 on the  dollar.  The
         Company also contributes  annually to the plan an amount equal to 2% of
         each  employee's  annual  compensation.   Expense  for  this  plan  was
         approximately $6.3 million in 1999 and $4.8 million in 1998.

         Effective  January 1, 1998, the Company also established a supplemental
         retirement plan and a compensation deferral plan for highly compensated
         employees.  The  supplemental  retirement  plan  is  a  noncontributory
         defined  contribution  plan with annual Company  contributions  ranging
         from 2% to 12% of base pay plus bonus  depending upon age plus years of
         service  and  salary  level.  Under  the  compensation   deferral  plan
         participants  may  defer up to 50% of base  pay and 100% of bonus  pay,
         reduced by any deferral to the 401(k) plan. Expense for these plans was
         approximately $1.0 million in 1999 and $0.4 million in 1998.


8.       Capital Stock:

         The  authorized  capital stock of the Company  consists of common stock
         and preferred stock. In June 1998, the Company increased the authorized
         shares of common stock to 500,000,000  shares and the authorized shares
         of preferred stock to 10,000,000 shares.

         In 1994, the Company exchanged 1,715,742 shares of Series A Convertible
         Junior  Preferred  Stock for the  8,578,710  shares  of Dollar  General
         common  stock  owned  by  C.T.S.,  Inc.,  a  personal  holding  Company
         controlled  by members of the Turner  family,  the  founders  of Dollar
         General. The Series A Convertible Junior Preferred Stock was authorized
         by the Board of Directors out of the authorized but unissued  preferred
         stock  approved by the  Company's  shareholders  in 1992. On August 23,
         1999,  the holders of all of the Company's 1.7 million shares of Series
         A Convertible  Junior  Preferred  Stock  converted their shares to 40.9
         million shares of Dollar  General  Common Stock in accordance  with the
         relevant provisions of the Company's charter.  Consequently,  preferred
         stock and treasury  stock  balances  were  reduced to zero.  This was a
         non-cash transaction.

         The Company has a  Shareholder  Rights  Plan (the  "Plan")  under which
         Series B Junior  Participating  Preferred  Stock  Purchase  Rights (the
         "Rights") were issued for each  outstanding  share of common stock. The
         Rights were  attached to all common stock  outstanding  as of March 10,
         2000,  and will be attached to all  additional  shares of common  stock
         issued prior to the Plan's  expiration  on February  28, 2010,  or such
         earlier termination,  if applicable.  The Rights entitle the holders to
         purchase  from the Company one  one-hundredth  of a share (a "Unit") of
         Series B Junior Participating  Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock"),
         no par  value,  at a  purchase  price  of $100  per  Unit,  subject  to
         adjustment.  Initially,  the  Rights  will  attach to all  certificates
         representing shares of outstanding Common Stock, and no separate Rights
         Certificates  will be distributed.  The Rights will become  exercisable
         upon the occurrence of a triggering event as defined in the Plan.


9.       Stock Incentive Plans:

         The Company has  established  stock incentive plans under which options
         to  purchase  common  stock  may  be  granted  to  executive  officers,
         directors and key employees.


         All  options  granted  in 1999,  1998 and 1997,  under  the 1998  Stock
         Incentive  Plan,  the 1995  Employee  Stock  Incentive  Plan,  the 1993
         Employee  Stock  Incentive  Plan and the 1995 Outside  Directors  Stock
         Option Plan, were  non-qualified  stock options issued at a price equal
         to the fair market value of the  Company's  common stock on the date of
         grant.   Non-qualified  options  granted  under  these  plans  have  an
         expiration  date of no later than ten years following the date of grant
         and have a vesting period of no less than one year.

         Under the plans,  grants are made to key management  employees  ranging
         from executive officers to store managers and assistant store managers,
         as well as other  employees as prescribed  by the  Company's  Corporate
         Governance and  Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors.  The
         number of options granted and vesting  schedules are directly linked to
         the employee's performance and position within the Company.

         The plans also  provide  for annual  grants to  non-employee  directors
         according to a non-discretionary  formula. The number of shares granted
         is dependent upon current director  compensation  levels and the market
         price of the stock.



         The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
         Employees,"  and related  interpretations  in accounting for its plans.
         The exercise price of options  awarded under these plans has been equal
         to the fair market value of the underlying  common stock on the date of
         grant. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its
         stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's
         stock-based  compensation plans been determined based on the fair value
         at the grant date for awards  under  these  plans  consistent  with the
         methodology  prescribed under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
         Compensation,"  net  income  and  earnings  per share  would  have been
         reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Earnings per share have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to all
common stock splits.

         The pro forma  effects on net  income  for 1999,  1998 and 1997 are not
         representative  of the pro forma  effect on net income in future  years
         because  they do not take into  consideration  pro  forma  compensation
         expense related to grants made prior to 1996. The fair value of options
         granted  during  1999,  1998,  and 1997 is  $11.55,  $9.69,  and $6.04,
         respectively.

         The fair value of each option  grant is  estimated on the date of grant
         using  the  Black-Scholes   option-pricing  model  with  the  following
         assumptions:

                                                        1999     1998      1997
