PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Our
    Company

IPG Photonics Corporation (“IPG,” the
    “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we”,
    “us” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware
    in 1998. The Company is the leading developer and manufacturer
    of a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers for diverse
    applications in numerous markets. Fiber lasers are a new
    generation of lasers that combine the advantages of
    semiconductor diodes, such as long life and high efficiency,
    with the high amplification and precise beam qualities of
    specialty optical fibers to deliver superior performance,
    reliability and usability.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, advanced,
    communications and medical applications. We sell our products
    globally to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system
    integrators and end users. We market our products
    internationally primarily through our direct sales force and
    also through agreements with independent sales representatives
    and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States,
    Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, China, South
    Korea, Singapore, India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture
    most key components used in our finished products, from
    semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber
    lasers and amplifiers. Our vertically integrated operations
    allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, ensure access to
    critical components and rapidly develop and integrate advanced
    products while protecting our proprietary technology.

Industry
    Background

Conventional
    Laser Technologies

Since the laser was invented over 45 years ago, laser
    technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and
    products in various industries, including automotive, medical,
    research, consumer products,



electronics, semiconductors and communications. Lasers provide
    flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat
    various materials. They are widely used to transmit large
    volumes of data in optical communications systems, in various
    medical applications and in test and measurement systems. For a
    wide variety of applications, lasers provide superior
    performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser
    technologies.

Lasers emit an intense light beam that can be focused on a small
    area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or
    change their character. These properties are utilized in
    applications requiring very high-power densities, such as
    marking, printing, welding, cutting and other materials
    processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and
    inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light
    to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in
    medical and sensing applications. A laser works by converting
    electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy
    source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the
    energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles
    of light, called photons, at a particular wavelength. Lasers are
    used as an energy or light source for various applications. They
    are also incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other
    systems by OEMs, system integrators and end users.

Historically,
    CO


gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser
    types used in materials processing and many other applications.
    They are named for the materials used to create the lasing
    action. A
    CO


laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled
    tube. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp, or
    diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The
    most common crystal lasers use YAG crystals infused with
    neodymium or ytterbium.

Introduction
    of Fiber Lasers

Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to
    pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth
    ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable
    in diameter to a human hair. The laser emission is created
    within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible cable. As
    a result of their different design and components, fiber lasers
    are more reliable, efficient, robust and portable, and easier to
    operate than conventional lasers. In addition, fiber lasers free
    the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high
    maintenance costs that are typical for conventional lasers.

Although low-power fiber lasers have existed for approximately
    four decades, their increased recent adoption has been driven
    primarily by our improvements in their performance, increases in
    output power levels and decreased costs. Over the last several
    years, technological improvements in optical components such as
    active fibers have increased their power capacities and resulted
    in overall performance improvements in fiber lasers. Fiber
    lasers offer output powers that exceed those of conventional
    lasers in many categories. Also, semiconductor diodes
    historically have represented the majority of the cost of fiber
    lasers. The high cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could
    not compete with conventional lasers on price and limited their
    use to high value-added applications. Recently, however,
    semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and reliable
    due, in part, to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode
    technology and increased production volumes. As a result, the
    average cost per watt of output power has decreased dramatically
    over the last decade. Because of these improvements, fiber
    lasers can now effectively compete with conventional lasers over
    a wide range of output powers and applications. As a pioneer in
    the development and commercialization of fiber lasers, we have
    contributed to many advancements in fiber laser technology and
    products.

Advantages
    of Fiber Lasers over Conventional Lasers

We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits
    that include:

•

Superior Performance.

Fiber lasers provide
    high beam quality over the entire power range. In most
    conventional laser solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to
    output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is
    virtually non-divergent over a wide power range, meaning the
    beam can be focused to achieve high levels of precision,
    increased power densities and greater distances over which
    processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and
    greater intensity of a fiber laser’s beam allow tasks to be
    accomplished rapidly and with lower-power units than comparable
    conventional lasers.



•

Lower Total Cost of Ownership.

Fiber lasers
    offer strong value to customers because of their generally lower
    total operating costs due to their lower required maintenance
    costs, high reliability and energy efficiency. The initial
    purchase price for fiber lasers is generally below that of YAG
    lasers and comparable to that of conventional
    CO


lasers. Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy
    2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped YAG lasers, 3
    times more efficiently than conventional
    CO


lasers and 15 to 30 times more efficiently than lamp-pumped YAG
    lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and
    place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal
    components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements
    compared to those of conventional lasers and lower or no
    maintenance costs.

•

Ease of Use.

Many features of fiber lasers
    make them easier to operate, maintain and integrate into
    laser-based systems as compared to conventional lasers.

•

Compact Size and Portability.

Fiber lasers are
    typically smaller and lighter in weight than conventional
    lasers, saving valuable floor space. While conventional lasers
    are delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber
    lasers are more durable and able to perform in variable
    environments.

•

Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of
    Beam.

The design of fiber lasers generally
    provides a broad range of wavelength choices, allowing users to
    select the precise wavelength that best matches their
    application and materials.

Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many
    of the same components, such as semiconductor diodes and
    specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same
    advantages in the applications that require amplification.

Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there
    remain applications and processes where conventional laser
    technologies may provide superior performance with respect to
    particular features. For example, crystal lasers can provide
    higher peak power pulses and fiber lasers do not generate the
    deep ultraviolet light that is used for photolithography in many
    semiconductor applications. In addition,
    CO


lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many
    non-metallic materials, including plastics, and may be preferred
    for certain types of metal cutting because of their wavelength
    capabilities and other features.

Our
    Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key strengths and competitive advantages
    include the following:

Differentiated Proprietary Technology
    Platform.

At the core of our products is our
    proprietary pumping technology platform that allows our products
    to have higher output powers and superior beam quality than are

Our
    Strategy

Our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership position
    by pursuing the following key elements of our strategy:

Leverage Our Technology to Gain Market
    Share.

As fiber lasers become more widely
    accepted, we plan to leverage our brand and position as the
    leader in developing and commercializing fiber lasers to
    increase our market share in the broader market. Our lasers
    continue to displace conventional lasers in numerous low and
    mid-power materials processing applications, such as marking,
    engraving and printing. Our high-power lasers also have been
    penetrating several applications that use conventional lasers,
    such as welding and cutting of metal parts.

Target New Applications for Lasers.

We intend
    to continue to enable and penetrate additional applications
    where lasers have not traditionally been used. We believe that
    fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that
    have hindered the adoption of conventional lasers. We target
    applications where higher power, portability, efficiency, size
    and flexible fiber cable delivery can lead customers to adopt
    fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. Examples of such
    targeted new applications include cutting of high strength steel
    alloys and battery welding for hybrid automobiles.

Expand Our Product Portfolio.

We continue to
    invest in research and development to add additional
    wavelengths, power levels and other parameters while also
    improving beam quality. In 2008, we started to sell our
    proprietary diodes, high energy pulsed lasers, and
    multi-kilowatt single mode lasers. Subsequent to
    December 31, 2008, we introduced a line of complimentary
    products used with our fiber lasers, including high power
    couplers, beam switches and delivery cables, and two types of
    green fiber lasers. In addition, we are currently developing new
    lasers, amplifiers and new laser diodes.

Optimize Our Manufacturing Capabilities.

We
    plan to seek further increases in the automation of our
    component manufacturing processes and device assembly to improve
    component yields and increase the power outputs and capacities
    of the various components that we make. We intend to leverage
    our technology and operations expertise to manufacture
    additional components in order to reduce costs, ensure component
    quality and ensure supply. In 2008, we invested in our own thin
    film facilities, other new in-house technologies and metal job
    shops to reduce the cost of housings for our products. Moreover,
    we have upgraded and simplified the design of our mid and high
    power systems that allows us to improve quality and decrease
    costs. These initiatives, in addition to optimizing our
    manufacturing capabilities and maintaining efficient labor
    costs, are intended to improve margins.

Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers
    Worldwide.

In 2008, more than 77% of our sales
    came from international customers. We intend to capitalize on
    and grow our global customer base by opening new application
    development centers as well as sales and service offices in
    Russia, Asia, Europe and the United States. In 2008, we opened
    new application development centers in Moscow and Michigan and a
    new sales office in Singapore. Subsequent to December 31,
    2008, we expanded our application and development center in
    Massachusetts, and we opened a new sales office and an
    application development center in California and a new sales
    office in France.

Products

We design and manufacture a broad range of high-performance
    optical fiber-based lasers and amplifiers. We also make packaged
    diodes, direct diode laser systems and communications systems
    that utilize our optical fiber-based products. In addition, we
    recently developed a compact and efficient
    CO


laser. Many of our products are designed to be used as general
    purpose energy or light sources, making them useful in diverse
    applications and markets.

Our products are based on a common proprietary technology
    platform using many of the same core components, such as
    semiconductor diodes, specialty fibers, beam combiners,
    isolators, polarizers, splitters and modulators, which we
    configure to our customers’ specifications. Our engineers
    and scientists work closely with OEMs and end users to develop
    and customize our products for their needs. Because of our
    flexible and modular product architecture, we offer products in
    different configurations according to the desired application,



including modules, rack-mounted units and tabletop units. Our
    engineers and other technical experts work directly with the
    customer in our application and development centers to develop
    and configure the optimal solution for each customer’s
    manufacturing requirements. We also make complementary products
    and components that are used with our ultra-high power products,
    such as fiber couplers, beam delivery cables and chillers. In
    addition, we make marking systems for sale in India and China.

Lasers

Our laser products include low (1 to 99 watts), medium (100 to
    999 watts) and high (1,000 watts and above) output power lasers
    from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. These lasers either may be
    continuous wave (CW) or may be modulated at different rates. We
    offer several different types of lasers, which are defined by
    the type of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium,
    thulium and Raman. We also sell fiber pigtailed packaged diodes
    and fiber coupled direct diode laser systems that use
    semiconductor diodes rather than optical fibers as their gain
    medium. In addition, we offer high-energy pulsed lasers,
    multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers, single-polarization and
    single-frequency lasers, as well as other versions of our
    products.

We believe that we produce the highest power solid-state lasers
    in the industry. Our ytterbium fiber lasers can reach power
    levels up of to 50,000 watts. We also make single-mode output
    ytterbium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 5,000 watts
    and single-mode output erbium and thulium fiber lasers with
    power levels of up to 400 watts. Our compact, durable design and
    integrated fiber optic beam delivery allows us to offer
    versatile laser energy sources and simple laser integration for
    complex production processes without compromising quality, speed
    or power.

We also sell laser diode chips and packaged laser diodes
    operating at 9XX nanometers. Recently, we started to sell our
    own family of high power process fibers, fiber couplers, optical
    switches, chillers and other accessories for our fiber lasers.

Amplifiers

Our amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to 500 watts
    of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We offer
    erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, commonly called EDFAs, Raman
    amplifiers and integrated communications systems that
    incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly
    deployed in broadband networks and dense wavelength division
    multiplexing, or DWDM, networks. We also offer ytterbium and
    thulium specialty fiber amplifiers and broadband light sources
    that are used in advanced applications. In addition, we sell
    single-frequency, linearly polarized and
    polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier products. As
    with our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer some of the
    highest output power levels and highest number of optical
    outputs in the industry. We believe our line of fiber amplifiers
    offers the best commercially available output power and
    performance.

Materials
    Processing

The most significant materials processing applications for fiber
    lasers are marking, printing, welding and cutting. Other
    applications include micromachining, surface treatment,
    drilling, soldering, annealing, rapid prototyping and
    laser-assisted machining.

Marking, Engraving and Printing
    Applications.

With the increasing need for source
    traceability, component identification and product tracking as a
    means of reducing product liability and preventing



falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic
    production systems, industrial manufacturers are increasingly
    demanding marking systems capable of applying serialized
    alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto
    their manufactured components. Laser engraving is similar to
    marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to
    conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can
    mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as
    ceramic, glass and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without
    contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by
    engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a
    customer’s production process and do not subject the item
    being marked to mechanical stress.

In the semiconductor industry, lasers typically are used to mark
    wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry,
    lasers typically are used to mark electrical components such as
    contactors and relays, printed circuit boards and keyboards.
    With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the
    cost of laser marking has decreased. In the photovoltaic (solar
    panel) industry, pulsed lasers increasingly are used to remove
    materials and to scribe (cut) solar cells. The high beam
    quality, increased peak output powers, flexible fiber delivery
    and competitive price of fiber lasers have accelerated the
    adoption of fiber lasers in these low-power applications.

Historically, the printing industry has depended upon
    silver-halide films and chemicals to engrave printing plates.
    This chemical engraving process requires several time-consuming
    steps. In recent years, we have worked closely with OEMs in the
    printing industry to employ fiber lasers for alternative
    “computer-to-plate,” or CTP, processes. As a result,
    our ytterbium fiber lasers are now widely used for CTP printing,
    an environmentally friendly process that saves production time
    by writing directly to plates and greatly reduces chemical waste.

Welding Applications.

Laser welding offers
    several important advantages over conventional welding
    technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate, provides high
    process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high quality welds
    that generally require little or no post-processing machining.
    Parts can be accurately machined before welding because laser
    welding does not overly heat or otherwise damage or distort the
    material being processed. The high beam quality of our fiber
    lasers coupled with high CW power offers deep penetration
    welding as well as shallow conduction mode welding. High
    modulation frequencies offer very high throughput in pulsed
    applications. In addition, fiber lasers can be focused to a
    small spot with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote
    welding “on the fly,” a flexible method of
    three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is positioned
    by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped
    with fiber lasers are used for welding door panels and the
    multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the entire auto body
    frame. Typically, mid- to high-power ytterbium fiber lasers are
    used in welding applications.

Cutting Applications.

Laser-based cutting
    technology has several advantages compared to alternative
    technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible, highly precise
    and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or
    three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be programmed
    to process many different kinds of materials such as steel,
    aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at various
    thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact process
    that is easy to integrate into an automated production line and
    is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell low, mid
    and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser cutting. The
    operating wavelength, multi-kilowatt power, high beam quality,
    wide operating power range, power stability and small spot size
    are some of the qualities offered by fiber lasers for most
    cutting applications.

Advanced
    Applications

Our fiber lasers and amplifiers are utilized by commercial firms
    and by academic and government institutions worldwide for
    manufacturing of commercial systems and for research in advanced
    technologies and products. These markets may use specialty
    products developed by us or commercial versions of our products.

Obstacle Warning.

Our products are used aboard
    aircraft for obstacle warning and

3-dimensional

mapping of earth surfaces.



Special Projects.

Due to the high power,
    compactness, performance, portability, ruggedness and electrical
    efficiency of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, we sell our
    commercial products for government research and projects. These
    include materials testing, ordnance destruction, coherent beam
    combining, advanced communications and research.

Research and Development.

Our products are
    used in a variety of applications for research and development
    by scientists and industrial researchers. In addition, our
    lasers and amplifiers are used to design, test and characterize
    components and systems in a variety of markets and applications.

Optical Pumping and Harmonic
    Generation.

Several types of our lasers are used
    to optically pump other solid-state lasers and for harmonic
    generation and parametric converters to support research in
    sensing, medical and other scientific research in the infrared
    and visible wavelength domains. Our lasers are used as a power
    source for these other lasers. Green visible lasers are used to
    pump titanium sapphire lasers. Visible lasers can be used in
    optical displays, planetariums and light shows.

Optical Communication.

We provide high-power
    EDFAs and ytterbium fiber amplifiers for deployment in both
    point-to-point and point-to-multipoint free space optical
    networks. These networks permit communications between two or
    more points on land or in the sky without the use of fiber optic
    lines or radio or microwaves.

Remote Sensing.

Our products are used in light
    detection and ranging, also called LIDAR, a laser technique for
    remote sensing. Optical fiber can be used as a sensor for
    measuring changes in temperature, pressure and gas concentration
    in oil wells, atmospheric and pollution measurements and seismic
    exploration.

Communications

We design and manufacture a DWDM transport system with varying
    output power and wavelengths and a full range of fiber
    amplifiers and Raman pump lasers that enhance data transmission
    in broadband access and DWDM optical networks. We are leveraging
    our high-power diode and fiber technology through the
    qualification and sale of high-value integrated solutions for
    network suppliers.

DWDM.

DWDM is a technology that expands the
    capacity of optical networks, allowing service providers to
    extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating
    and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a
    broad range of high-power products for DWDM applications
    including EDFAs and Raman lasers. We provide a DWDM transport
    system that offers service providers and private network
    operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution scalable
    from 8 to 40 channels that operates at 10 gibabits per second
    per channel.

Broadband Access.

The delivery to subscribers
    of television programming and Internet-based information and
    communication services is converging, driven by advances in IP
    technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive
    environment. Fiber optic lines offer connection speeds of up to
    50 megabits per second, or 50 times faster than digital
    subscriber lines (DSL) or cable links. We offer a series of
    specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable TV nodes and transmitters
    that support different types of passive optical network
    architectures, enabling high speed data, voice, video on demand
    and high definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to
    32 ports, which allows service providers to support a high
    number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power
    consumption and network cost. End users for our products include
    communications network operators for video wavelength division
    multiplexing overlay, as well as cable and multiple service
    operators for video signal and hybrid fiber coaxial cable.

Medical

We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that
    incorporate our products into their medical laser systems.
    Continuous wave and pulsed lasers from 1 to 150 watts and diode
    laser systems can be used in medical and biomedical
    applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include
    skin rejuvenation, skin resurfacing and stretch mark removal.
    Purchasers use our diode lasers in dental, skin tightening and
    fat melting procedures. Fiber lasers have the ability to
    fine-tune optical penetration depth and absorption
    characteristics and can be used for ear, nose and throat,
    urology, gynecology and other surgical procedures. Visible
    lasers can be used in prostate, ophthalmic and dental procedures
    in addition to photodynamic therapies.



Technology

Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform
    that we have developed and refined since our formation. The
    following technologies are key elements in our products.

Specialty
    Optical Fibers

We have extensive expertise in the disciplines and techniques
    that form the basis for the multi-clad active and passive
    optical fibers used in our products. Active optical fibers form
    the laser cavity or gain medium in which lasing or amplification
    of light occurs in our products. Passive optical fibers deliver
    the optical energy created in our products. Our active fibers
    consist of an inner core that is infused with the appropriate
    rare earth ion, such as ytterbium, erbium or thulium, and outer
    cores of un-doped glass having different indices of refraction.
    We believe that our large portfolio of specialty active and
    passive optical fibers has a number of advantages as compared to
    other commercially available optical fibers. These advantages
    include higher concentrations of rare earth ions, fibers that
    will not degrade at the high power levels over the useful life
    of the product, high lasing efficiency, ability to achieve
    single-mode outputs at high powers, ability to withstand high
    optical energies and temperatures and scalable side-pumping
    capability.

Semiconductor
    Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies

Another key element of our technology platform is that we use
    multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather
    than diode bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that
    multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and
    reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode
    bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability.
    Single-emitter diodes have substantially reduced cooling
    requirements and typically have estimated lifetimes of more than
    200,000 hours at high operating currents, compared to
    typical lifetimes of 10,000 to 20,000 hours for diode bars.

We developed advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow
    alumina indium gallium arsenide wafers for our diodes. This
    method yields high-quality optoelectronic material for
    low-defect density and high uniformity of optoelectronic
    parameters. In addition, we have developed numerous proprietary
    wafer processes and testing and qualification procedures in
    order to create a high energy output in a reliable and
    high-power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically sealed
    pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an optical
    fiber output. Characteristics such as the ability of the package
    to dissipate heat produced by the diode and withstand vibration,
    shock, high temperature, humidity and other environmental
    conditions are critical to the reliability and efficiency of the
    products.

Specialty
    Components and Combining Techniques

We developed a wide range of advanced optical components that
    are capable of handling high optical power levels and contribute
    to the superior performance, efficiency, reliability and
    uniqueness of our products. In addition to fibers and diodes,
    our optical component portfolio includes fiber gratings,
    isolators and combiners. We also developed special methods and
    expertise in splicing fibers together with low optical energy
    loss and on-line loss testing. We believe that our internal
    development and manufacturing of key optical components allows
    us to lower our manufacturing costs and improve product
    performance.

Side
    Pumping of Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a large
    number of multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes with
    our active optical fibers that are used in all of our products.
    A key element of this technology is that we pump our fiber
    lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core. We
    splice our specialty active optical fibers with other optical
    components and package them in a sealed box, which we call a
    fiber block. The fiber blocks are compact and eliminate the risk
    of contamination or misalignment due to mechanical vibrations
    and shocks as well as temperature or humidity variations. Our
    design is scalable and modular, permitting us to make products
    with high output power by coupling a large number of diodes with
    fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and serially.



High-Stress
    Testing

We employ high-stress techniques in testing components and final
    products that help increase reliability and accelerate product
    development. For example, we test all of our diodes with high
    current and temperatures to accelerate aging. We also have built
    a large database of diode test results that allows us to predict
    the estimated lifetime of our diodes. This testing allows us to
    eliminate defective diodes prior to further assembly and thus
    increase reliability.

Customers

We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and
    end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the
    in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into
    their own systems. We have hundreds of customers worldwide. Our
    end markets include materials processing (comprised of general
    manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, consumer
    products, photovoltaic semiconductor and electronics customers),
    advanced applications (comprised of commercial companies,
    universities, research entities and government entities),
    communications (comprised of system integrators, utilities and
    municipalities) and medical (medical laser systems
    manufacturers) . We believe that our customer and end market
    diversification minimizes dependence on any single industry or
    group of customers.

Backlog

At December 31, 2008, our backlog of orders (generally
    scheduled for shipment within one year) was approximately
    $69.3 million compared to $72.6 million at
    December 31, 2007. Orders used to compute backlog are
    generally cancelable without substantial penalties.
    Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by us has not
    been significant. We manage the risk of cancellation by
    establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that
    generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials
    and development costs incurred prior to the order being
    cancelled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many
    factors including, but not limited to, the customer’s
    requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding
    orders with the customer and our ability to quickly convert the
    cancelled order to another sale.



The Company anticipates shipping a substantial majority of the
    present backlog during fiscal year 2009. However, the
    Company’s backlog at any given date is not necessarily
    indicative of actual sales for any future period.

Sales,
    Marketing and Support

We market our products internationally primarily through our
    direct sales force and also through agreements with independent
    sales representatives and distributors. We have sales offices in
    the United States, Germany, Russia, Italy, China, Japan, South
    Korea, India, the United Kingdom, Singapore and France. Our
    independent sales representatives and distributors are located
    in the United States, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Mexico and other
    parts of the world. Only one of these arrangements is on an
    exclusive basis. Foreign sales to customers are generally priced
    in local currencies and are therefore subject to currency
    exchange fluctuations.

We maintain a customer support and field service staff in our
    major markets. We work closely with customers, customer groups
    and independent representatives to service equipment, train
    customers to use our products and explore additional
    applications for our technologies. We have application centers
    in the United States, Germany, Russia, China, Japan and
    South Korea, which we use to demonstrate our products and
    develop new applications. We may expand our support and field
    service, particularly in locations where customer concentration
    or volume requires local service capabilities. We repair
    products at our facilities or at customer sites.

We typically provide one to three-year parts and service
    warranties on our lasers and amplifiers. Most of our sales
    offices provide support to customers in their respective
    geographic areas. Warranty reserves have generally been
    sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement
    costs.

Manufacturing

Vertical integration is one of our core business strategies
    through which we control our proprietary processes and
    technologies as well as the supply of key components and
    assemblies. We believe that our vertically integrated business
    model gives us the following advantages:

•

maintaining a technological lead over competitors;

•

reducing component and final product costs compared to market
    prices available to competitors;

•

ensuring access to critical components, enabling us to better
    meet customer demands;

•

controlling performance, quality and consistency; and

•

enabling rapid development and deployment of new products and
    technologies.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include
    optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor
    wafer growth, diode processing and packaging, specialty optical
    component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly
    for different power units, software and electronics development,
    final assembly, as well as testing, tool manufacturing and
    automated production systems. Recently, we added additional
    production capabilities, including three multi-wafer growth
    reactors, diode test stations, fiber pre-form and fiber drawing
    equipment, low, mid and high-power production and testing, in
    order to increase our capacity as well as reduce the risks
    associated with our production process.

We operate our own semiconductor foundry for the production of
    the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that
    are used as the light source in each device we make. We also
    process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. Because
    pump diodes represent a significant component cost of the final
    laser or amplifier, we have chosen to develop internal
    manufacturing capabilities for diodes. As a result of our high
    volume production levels of pump diodes, proprietary processes
    and use of limited chip designs, we have been able to increase
    yields, lower component costs and assure high quality. We also
    design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test
    instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly
    tools and machines.



We developed these proprietary components, manufacturing tools,
    equipment and techniques over many years in an effort to address
    the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of
    fiber laser technology and to provide products that
    differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that the
    proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment,
    techniques and software utilized in all of our product lines
    provide extensive barriers to potential competitors. Generally,
    we do not sell our proprietary components to third parties,
    except that in 2008, we started selling our diodes. Using our
    technology platform, we configure standard products based upon
    each customer’s specifications. Through our vertically
    integrated manufacturing operations, we can develop, test and
    produce new products and configurations with higher performance
    and reliability and in less time than by working with external
    vendors. We have developed proprietary testing methodologies
    that allow us to develop higher power components and products in
    short periods of time, enable us to introduce products to the
    market more quickly, capitalize on new opportunities and provide
    superior service to our customers.

Our in-house manufacturing generally includes only those
    operations and components that are critical to the protection of
    our intellectual property, the reduction of our costs or the
    achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase
    from vendors common as well as specialized mechanical,
    electrical and optical parts and raw materials, such as printed
    circuit boards, wafer substrates and various optical components.

Research
    and Development

We have extensive research and development experience in laser
    materials, fiber and optoelectronic components. We have
    assembled a team of scientists and engineers with specialized
    experience and extensive knowledge in fiber lasers and
    amplifiers, critical components, testing and manufacturing
    process design.

We focus our research and development efforts on designing and
    introducing new and improved standard and customized products
    and the mass production of components that go into our products.
    In addition to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we
    have core competencies in high-power multi-mode semiconductor
    laser diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive
    optical fibers, high-performance optical components, fiber gain
    blocks and fiber modules, as well as splicing and combining
    techniques and high-stress test methods. Our research and
    development efforts are aided by our vertical integration and
    our proprietary high-stress testing techniques that result in
    accelerated development cycles. The strategy of developing our
    proprietary components has allowed us to leverage our optical
    experience and large volume requirements to lower the cost of
    our products. We concentrate our research and development
    efforts on advancements in performance as well as capacity to
    hold and produce higher optical power levels.

Our research and development efforts are also directed at
    expanding our product line by increasing power levels, improving
    beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing the size of
    our products and lowering the cost per watt. We also are engaged
    in research projects to expand the spectral range of products
    that we offer. Our team of experienced scientists and engineers
    work closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce
    custom products that address specific applications and
    performance requirements.

We incurred research and development costs of approximately
    $15.8 million in 2008, $9.5 million in 2007 and
    $6.5 million in 2006. We plan to continue our commitment to
    research and development and to introduce new products, systems
    and complementary products that would allow us to maintain our
    competitive position. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Results of
    Operations.”

Intellectual
    Property

We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through
    U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade
    secrets, and to seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and
    trademark protection of our products and processes where
    appropriate. Historically, we relied primarily on trade secrets,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    relating to our product development and manufacturing
    activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary
    information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into
    agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and
    the assignment to us of rights to inventions that they make
    while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure
    agreements with our



consultants and suppliers to protect confidential information
    delivered to them. We believe that our vertical integration,
    including our long experience in making a wide range of
    specialty and high-power capacity components, as well as our
    technology platform make it difficult for others to reverse
    engineer our products.

We have increased our efforts to expand our patent portfolio. In
    February 2008, we purchased a portfolio of photonics patents
    from British Telecommunications plc that included approximately
    100 U.S. patents and 340 foreign counterparts in the fields
    of optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, semiconductor devices,
    integrated optics, fiber gratings, high-speed systems and
    optical networking. In addition, as of March 1, 2009, we
    had over 40 patent applications filed and under review by the
    relevant patent authorities. In 2007 and 2008, we were issued
    three patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
    relating to optical fibers, bulk optics and telecommunications
    systems. Intellectual property rights, including those that we
    own and those of others, involve significant risks. See
    Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Our inability to Protect Our
    Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technologies Could Result
    in the Unauthorized Use of Our Technologies by Third Parties,
    Hurt Our Competitive Position and Adversely Affect Our Operating
    Results.”

Competition

Our markets are competitive and characterized by rapidly
    changing technology and continuously evolving customer
    requirements. We believe that the primary competitive factors in
    our markets are:

•

product performance and reliability;

•

quality and service support;

•

price and value to the customer;

•

ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis;

•

ability to achieve qualification for and integration into OEM
    systems;

•

ability to meet customer specifications; and

•

ability to respond quickly to market demand and technological
    developments.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these criteria.
    In the materials processing market, the competition is
    fragmented and includes a large number of competitors. We
    compete with makers of high-power conventional
    CO


and solid-state lasers, including Fanuc, Lasag Ltd., Rofin-Sinar
    Technologies, Inc. and Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, and makers of mid
    and low-power conventional
    CO


and solid-state lasers such as Coherent, Inc., GSI Group Inc.,
    Newport Corporation and Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. We also
    compete with fiber laser makers including Rofin-Sinar
    Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc.,
    Coherent Inc., Newport Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co.,
    Ltd., Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi
    Unitek Corporation, MPB Communications Inc. and JDS Uniphase
    Corporation. We believe that we compete favorably with other
    makers of fiber lasers on price, service, installed base and
    performance with respect to low and mid-power fiber lasers.
    Competition from other fiber laser makers has increased in this
    power range. We currently have limited competition in high-power
    fiber lasers, but several competitors have announced plans to
    introduce high-power fiber lasers that would compete with our
    products. We also compete in the materials processing, advanced
    and medical applications markets with end users that produce
    their own solid-state and gas lasers as well as with
    manufacturers of non-laser methods and tools, such as resistance
    welding and cutting dies in the materials processing market and
    scalpels in the medical market.

In the communications market, our principal competitors are
    manufacturers of mid-power fiber amplifiers and DWDM systems,
    such as Bookham Inc., the Scientific-Atlanta division of Cisco
    Systems, Inc. (Scientific-Atlanta), Emcore Corporation, JDS
    Uniphase Corporation, Huawei Corporation and MPB Communications
    Inc. We believe that we compete favorably with other high-power
    fiber amplifier producers with respect to price, product
    performance and output power. The fiber amplifier market is more
    established than the fiber laser market and technological change
    has not occurred as rapidly as it has in the case of fiber
    lasers.



Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    1,420 full-time employees, including 147 in research and
    development, 1,054 in manufacturing operations, 90 in sales,
    service and marketing, and 131 in general and administrative
    functions. Of our total full-time employees at our principal
    facilities, approximately 392 were in the United States, 510
    were in Germany, 383 were in Russia and 51 were in China. We
    have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees
    is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that
    our current relations with our employees are good.

Government
    Regulation

Regulatory
    Compliance

The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the
    United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products
    under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for
    Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration. The same classification system is applied
    in the European markets. Safety rules are formulated with
    “Deutsche Industrie Norm” (i.e., German Industrial
    Standards) or ISO standards, which are internationally
    harmonized.

CDRH regulations generally require a self-certification
    procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing
    to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser
    device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply
    with product labeling standards, product safety and design
    features and informational requirements. Our products
    applications can result in injury to human tissue if directed at
    an individual or otherwise misused. The CDRH is empowered to
    seek fines and other remedies for violations of their
    requirements. We believe that our products are in material
    compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the
    manufacture of laser devices.

Environmental
    Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws governing the environment, including those
    relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product
    composition and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous
    and toxic materials. We believe that our operations are in
    material compliance with applicable environmental protection
    laws and regulations.

Although we believe that our safety procedures for using,
    handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with
    the standards required by federal and state laws and
    regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of
    accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the
    event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be
    liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of
    our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our
    business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The factors described below are the principal risks that
    could materially adversely affect our operating results and
    financial condition. Other factors may exist that we do not
    consider significant based on information that is currently
    available. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we
    cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they
    may affect us.

Downturns
    in the markets we serve, particularly materials processing,
    could have a material adverse effect on our sales and
    profitability.

Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by
    our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials
    processing market, which includes automotive, marking,
    electronics and photovoltaic applications. Approximately 81.9%
    of our revenues in 2008 were from customers in the materials
    processing market. Although applications in this market are
    broad, sales for these applications are cyclical and have
    historically experienced sudden and severe downturns and periods
    of oversupply, resulting in significantly reduced demand for
    capital equipment, including the products that we manufacture
    and market. For the foreseeable future, our operations will
    continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in
    this market, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for their
    products or services. Decreased demand for products and services
    from customers for these applications during an economic
    downturn may lead to decreased demand for our products, which
    would reduce our sales or sales growth rate. We may not be able
    to respond by decreasing our expenses quickly enough, due in
    part, to our fixed overhead structure related to our
    vertically-integrated operations and our commitments to
    continuing investment in research and development.

Uncertainty
    and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of
    markets in which we participate negatively affect our
    business.

Current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate
    the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole.
    It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in
    various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the
    materials processing, telecommunications, advanced and medical
    markets and applications in which we participate. Because all
    components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon
    estimates of growth or contraction in the markets and
    applications we serve and demand for our products, the
    prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
    income and expenditures very difficult to make. Adverse changes
    have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of
    declining or flat global or regional economic conditions,
    fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering
    confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment,
    declines in stock markets, contraction of credit availability,
    declines in real estate values, or other factors affecting
    economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively
    affect the sales of our lasers and amplifiers, increase exposure
    to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the
    availability of financing, increase the risk of loss on
    investments, or increase costs associated with manufacturing and
    distributing products. A prolonged economic downturn could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Our
    sales are dependent upon the continued availability of
    third-party financing arrangements for our some of our
    customers.

The recent economic downturn has resulted in tighter credit
    markets, which could adversely affect our customers’
    ability to secure the financing necessary to proceed with or
    continue orders for our products. Our customers’ or
    potential customers’ inability to secure financing for
    orders could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of
    new orders or the suspension of orders already under contract,
    which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and
    negatively impact our revenues and earnings.

Our
    sales depend upon our ability to penetrate new applications for
    fiber lasers and increase our market share in existing
    applications.

Our level of sales will depend on our ability to generate sales
    of fiber lasers in applications where conventional lasers, such
    as
    CO


and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers, have been used or in
    new and



developing markets and applications for lasers where they have
    not been used previously. To date, a significant portion of our
    revenue growth has been derived from sales of fiber lasers
    primarily for applications where
    CO


and YAG lasers historically have been used. In order to maintain
    or increase market demand for our fiber laser products, we will
    need to devote substantial resources to:

•

demonstrate the effectiveness of fiber lasers in new
    applications;

•

increase our direct and indirect sales efforts;

•

extend our product line to address new applications for our
    products;

•

continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and enhance our
    competitive position; and

•

effectively service and support our installed product base.

If we are unable to implement our strategy to develop new
    applications for our products, our revenues, operating results
    and financial condition could be adversely affected. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our
    business strategy. In addition, our newly developed or enhanced
    products may not achieve market acceptance or may be rendered
    obsolete or less competitive by the introduction of new products
    by other companies.

If
    fiber lasers do not achieve broader market acceptance or if
    market penetration occurs more slowly than we expect, sales and
    profitability may be negatively impacted.

Fiber lasers are relatively new when compared to conventional
    lasers and our future success depends on the development and
    broader acceptance of fiber lasers. Potential customers may be
    reluctant to adopt fiber lasers as an alternative to
    conventional lasers, such as
    CO


and YAG, and non-laser methods, such as mechanical tools. Such
    potential customers may have substantial investments and
    know-how related to their existing laser and non-laser
    technologies, and may perceive risks relating to the
    reliability, quality, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fiber
    lasers when compared to other laser or non-laser technologies
    available in the market. Many of our target markets, such as the
    automotive, machine tool and other manufacturing, communications
    and medical industries, have historically adopted new
    technologies slowly. These markets often require long test and
    qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes
    before adopting new technologies. As a result, we may expend
    significant resources and time to qualify our products for a new
    customer application, and we cannot assure that our products
    will be qualified or approved for such markets. If acceptance of
    fiber laser technology, and of our fiber lasers in particular,
    does not continue to grow within the markets that we serve, then
    the opportunities to maintain or increase our revenues and
    profitability may be severely limited.

Our
    vertically integrated business results in high levels of fixed
    costs and inventory levels that may adversely impact our gross
    profits and our operating results in the event that demand for
    our products declines or we maintain excess inventory
    levels.

We have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated
    business model, including the fact that approximately 74% of our
    1,420 employees as of December 31, 2008 were employed
    in our manufacturing operations. We may not adjust these fixed
    costs quickly enough to adapt to rapidly changing market
    conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of net sales, is impacted by our sales volume, the
    corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead
    expenses and manufacturing yields. In addition, because we are a
    vertically integrated manufacturer and design and manufacture
    our key specialty components, insufficient demand for our
    products may subject us to the risks of high inventory carrying
    costs and increased inventory obsolescence. If our capacity and
    production levels are not properly sized in relation to expected
    demand, we may need to record write-downs for excess or obsolete
    inventory. Because we are vertically integrated, the rate at
    which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared
    to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change
    significantly in the future and believe that we will have to
    maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our
    cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a
    significant amount of working capital invested in inventory and
    changes in our level of inventory to lead to an increase in cash
    generated from our operations when inventory is sold or a
    decrease in cash generated from



our operations at times when the amount of inventory increases.
    We may be required to write-down inventory costs in the future
    as we have done in the past, and the high inventory costs may
    have an adverse effect on our gross profits and our operating
    results.

Our
    manufacturing capacity and operations may not be appropriate for
    future levels of demand and may adversely affect our gross
    margins.

In response to an increase in demand for our fiber lasers, we
    started adding substantial manufacturing capacity at our
    facilities in the United States, Germany and Russia beginning in
    2005. We continue to expand our capacity further in Russia. A
    significant portion of our manufacturing facilities and
    production equipment, such as our semiconductor production and
    processing equipment, diode packaging equipment and diode
    burn-in stations, are special-purpose in nature and cannot be
    adapted easily to make other products. If the demand for fiber
    lasers or amplifiers does not increase or decreases from current
    levels, we may have significant excess manufacturing capacity,
    which could in turn adversely affect our gross margins and
    profitability.

To maintain our competitive position as the leading developer
    and manufacturer of fiber lasers and to meet anticipated demand
    for our products, we invested significantly in the expansion of
    our manufacturing and operations throughout the world and may do
    so in the future. We incurred in the past and will incur
    significant costs associated with the acquisition, build-out and
    preparation of our facilities. We had capital expenditures of
    $37 million and $34 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and we expect to incur approximately
    $15 million in capital expenditures in 2009. In connection
    with these projects, we may incur cost overruns, construction
    delays, labor difficulties or regulatory issues which could
    cause our capital expenditures to be higher than what we
    currently anticipate, possibly by a material amount, which would
    in turn adversely impact our operating results. Moreover, we may
    experience higher costs due to yield loss, production
    inefficiencies and equipment problems until any operational
    issues associated with the opening of new manufacturing
    facilities are resolved.

Because
    we lack long-term purchase commitments from our customers, our
    sales can be difficult to predict, which could lead to excess or
    obsolete inventory and adversely affect our operating
    results.

We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or
    amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase
    orders and shipment schedules and, in some cases, orders may be
    cancelled or delayed without significant penalty. As a result,
    it is difficult to forecast our revenues and to determine the
    appropriate levels of inventory required to meet future demand.
    In addition, due to the absence of long-term volume purchase
    agreements, we forecast our revenues and plan our production and
    inventory levels based upon the demand forecasts of our OEM
    customers, end users, and distributors, which are highly
    unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. This could lead
    to increased inventory levels and increased carrying costs and
    risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to unanticipated
    reductions in purchases by our customers. In this regard, we
    recorded provisions for inventory totaling $3.8 million,
    $2.5 million and $1.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. These provisions were recorded as a result of
    changes in market prices of certain components, the value of
    those inventories that was realizable through finished product
    sales and uncertainties related to the recoverability of the
    value of inventories due to technological changes and excess
    quantities. If our OEM customers, end users or distributors fail
    to accurately forecast the demand for our products, fail to
    accurately forecast the timing of such demand, or are unable to
    consistently negotiate acceptable purchase order terms with
    customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

We may
    experience lower than expected manufacturing yields, which would
    adversely affect our gross margins.

The manufacture of semiconductor diodes and the packaging of
    them is a highly complex process. Manufacturers often encounter
    difficulties in achieving acceptable product yields from diode
    and packaging operations. We have from time to time experienced
    lower than anticipated manufacturing yields for our diodes and
    packaged diodes. This occurs during the production of new
    designs and the installation and

start-up

of



new process technologies. If we do not achieve planned yields,
    our product costs could increase resulting in lower gross
    margins, and key component availability would decrease.

We are
    subject to litigation alleging that we are infringing
    third-party intellectual property rights. Intellectual property
    claims could result in costly litigation and harm our
    business.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving
    intellectual property rights in many technology-based
    industries, including our own. We face risks and uncertainties
    in connection with such litigation, including the risk that
    patents issued to others may harm our ability to do business;
    that there could be existing patents of which we are unaware
    that could be pertinent to our business; and that it is not
    possible for us to know whether there are patent applications
    pending that our products might infringe upon, since patent
    applications often are not disclosed until a patent is issued or
    published. Moreover, the frequency with which new patents are
    granted and the diversity of jurisdictions in which they are
    granted make it impractical and expensive for us to monitor all
    patents that may be relevant to our business.

From time to time, we have been notified of allegations and
    claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual
    property rights owned by third parties. In 2007, we settled two
    patent infringement lawsuits filed against us. We are presently
    defending two patent infringement lawsuits. In November 2006,
    IMRA America, Inc. filed an action against us alleging that
    certain products we produce, including but not limited to our
    continuous wave and pulsed fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers,
    which account for a significant portion of our revenues,
    infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA America.
    IMRA America alleges willful infringement and seeks damages of
    at least $10 million, treble damages and injunctive relief.
    IMRA America also alleges inducement of infringement and
    contributory infringement. We filed an answer in which we denied
    infringement and raised additional defenses that the patent is
    invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we filed declaratory
    judgment counterclaims based on these three defenses. This
    lawsuit concerns products made, used, sold or offered for sale
    in or imported into the United States and therefore the lawsuit
    affects products that account for a substantial portion of our
    revenues. This lawsuit does not affect revenues that are derived
    from products that are not made, used, sold or offered for sale
    in or imported into the United States. In June 2008, the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”)
    ordered re-examination of the patent claims asserted by IMRA
    America, Inc. against the Company based on several prior art
    references that we submitted in an

ex parte

re-examination request. The U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Michigan had previously stayed the
    litigation until the conclusion of the re-examination.

In February 2008, CardioFocus Inc. filed an action against us
    alleging that our erbium and thulium fiber lasers infringe one
    patent allegedly owned by CardioFocus and seeks unspecified
    damages, treble damages and attorneys’ fees for alleged
    willful infringement. The plaintiff also alleges inducement of
    infringement. The patent claims generally relate to a system for
    transmitting laser energy via an optical fiber to a surgical
    site. The patent expired in April 2007. We filed an answer in
    which we denied infringement and raised additional defenses that
    the patent is invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we filed
    declaratory judgment counterclaims based on these three
    defenses. Also, the plaintiff in this litigation recently
    alleged that the Company infringes claims of two additional
    patents and we are investigating a response to such allegations.
    The USPTO granted the reexamination requests submitted by us and
    other defendants. In two office actions in November 2008, the
    USPTO rejected all of the claims for the CardioFocus patents
    alleged to be infringed. In February 2009, CardioFocus responded
    to the USPTO office actions. The U.S. District Court for
    the District of Massachusetts has stayed the litigation until
    the earlier of October 2009 or the conclusion of the
    re-examination. The Court indicated that it will consider
    extending the stay for an additional year if the re-examinations
    are not completed in one year. Discovery has not yet commenced.

Several outcomes are possible from the re-examinations,
    including the cancellation or confirmation of one or more of the
    current claims of the patents. Furthermore, with regard to any
    unexpired patents in re-examination, the current claims can be
    amended, and new claims can be added, provided that such
    amendments and additions do not enlarge the overall scope of the
    claims. An adverse outcome in a USPTO re-examination could have
    an adverse impact on our defenses in our litigation with IMRA
    America

and/or

CardioFocus.



There can be no assurance that we will be able to amicably
    dispose of our pending litigation with IMRA America or
    CardioFocus, claims or other allegations made against us and
    claims that may be asserted in the future. The outcome of any
    litigation, including the pending litigation, is uncertain, as
    is the outcome of our request for re-examination of the IMRA
    America patent. Even if we ultimately are successful on the
    merits of any such litigation or re-examination, legal and
    administrative proceedings related to intellectual property are
    typically expensive and time-consuming, generate negative
    publicity and divert financial and managerial resources. Some
    litigants may have greater financial resources than we have and
    may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual
    property litigation more easily than we can.

If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation
    brought against us, including the lawsuits brought by IMRA
    America and CardioFocus, it could affect our ability to sell our
    products and materially harm our business, financial condition
    and results of operations. These developments could adversely
    affect our ability to compete for customers and increase our
    revenues. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek,
    and sometimes obtain, injunctive relief. Intellectual property
    litigation commenced against us, including the lawsuits brought
    by IMRA America and CardioFocus that we are presently defending,
    could force us to take actions that could be harmful to our
    business, competitive position, results of operations and
    financial condition, including the following:

•

stop selling our products or using the technology that contains
    the allegedly infringing intellectual property;

•

pay actual monetary damages, royalties, lost profits or
    increased damages and the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees,
    which individually or in the aggregate may be substantial;

•

attempt to obtain a license to use the relevant intellectual
    property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at
    all; and

•

attempt to redesign the products that allegedly infringed upon
    intellectual property of others, which may be costly or
    impractical.

In addition, intellectual property lawsuits can be brought by
    third parties against OEMs and end users that incorporate our
    products into their systems or processes. In some cases, we
    indemnify OEMs against third-party infringement claims relating
    to our products and we often make representations affirming,
    among other things, that our products do not infringe on the
    intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may
    incur liabilities in connection with lawsuits against our
    customers. Any such lawsuits, whether or not they have merit,
    could be time-consuming to defend, damage our reputation or
    result in substantial and unanticipated costs.

Our
    inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
    technologies could result in the unauthorized use of our
    technologies by third parties, hurt our competitive position and
    adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on patents, trade secret laws, contractual agreements,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    to protect our products, product development and manufacturing
    activities from unauthorized copying by third parties. Although
    we acquired a patent portfolio in 2008 and started a program in
    2007 to increase the number of patent applications we file, our
    patents do not cover all of our technologies, products and
    product components and may not prevent third parties from
    unauthorized copying of our technologies, products and product
    components. We seek to protect our proprietary technology under
    laws affording protection for trade secrets. We also seek to
    protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part,
    by requiring employees to enter into agreements providing for
    the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment of rights
    to inventions made by them while employed by us. We have
    significant international operations and we are subject to
    foreign laws which differ in many respects from U.S. laws.
    Policing unauthorized use of our trade secret technologies
    throughout the world and proving misappropriation of our
    technologies are particularly difficult, especially due to the
    number of our employees and operations in numerous foreign
    countries. The steps that we take to acquire ownership of our
    employees’ inventions and trade secrets in foreign
    countries may not have been effective under all such local laws,
    which could expose us



to potential claims or the inability to protect intellectual
    property developed by our employees. Furthermore, any changes
    in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other
    intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate
    may adversely affect our ability to enforce our trade secret and
    intellectual property positions. Costly and time-consuming
    litigation could be necessary to determine the scope of our
    confidential information and trade secret protection. We also
    enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and
    other suppliers to protect our confidential information that we
    deliver to them. However, there can be no assurance that our
    confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that we will be
    able to effectively enforce them or that we will have adequate
    remedies for any breach.

Given our reliance on trade secret laws, others may
    independently develop similar or alternative technologies or
    duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we
    have made. Therefore, our intellectual property efforts may be
    insufficient to maintain our competitive advantage or to stop
    other parties from commercializing similar products or
    technologies. Many countries outside of the United States afford
    little or no protection to trade secrets and other intellectual
    property rights. Intellectual property litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that we
    will have the resources to fully enforce our rights. If we are
    unable to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our
    intellectual property rights, or the independent development or
    design of similar technologies, our competitive position and
    operating results could suffer.

We
    depend upon internal production and on outside single or
    limited-source suppliers for many of our key components and raw
    materials. Any interruption in the supply of these key
    components and raw materials could adversely affect our results
    of operations.

We rely exclusively on our own production capabilities to
    manufacture certain of our key components, such as semiconductor
    diodes, specialty optical fibers and optical components. We do
    not have redundant production lines for some of our components,
    such as our diodes and some other components, which are made at
    a single manufacturing facility. These may not be readily
    available from other sources at our current costs. If our
    manufacturing activities were obstructed or hampered
    significantly, it could take a considerable length of time, or
    it could increase our costs, for us to resume manufacturing or
    find alternative sources of supply. Many of the tools and
    equipment we use are custom-designed, and it could take a
    significant period of time to repair or replace them. Our three
    major manufacturing facilities are located in Oxford,
    Massachusetts; Burbach, Germany; and Fryazino, Russia. If, as a
    result of a flood, fire, natural disaster, political unrest, act
    of terrorism, war, outbreak of disease or other similar event,
    any of our three major manufacturing facilities or equipment
    should become inoperable, inaccessible, damaged or destroyed,
    our business could be adversely affected to the extent that we
    do not have redundant production capabilities.

Also, we purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture our
    products and other components, such as semiconductor wafer
    substrates, diode packages, modulators, micro-optics, bulk
    optics and high-power beam delivery products, from single or
    limited-source suppliers. In general, we have no long-term
    contractual supply arrangements with these suppliers. Some of
    our suppliers are also our competitors. Furthermore, other than
    our current suppliers, there are a limited number of entities
    from whom we could obtain these supplies. We do not anticipate
    that we would be able to purchase these components or raw
    materials that we require in a short period of time or at the
    same cost from other sources in commercial quantities or that
    have our required performance specifications. Any interruption
    or delay in the supply of any of these components or materials,
    or the inability to obtain these components and materials from
    alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable
    amount of time, could adversely affect our business. If our
    suppliers face financial or other difficulties or if there are
    significant changes in demand for the components and materials
    we obtain from them, they could limit the availability of these
    components and materials to us, which in turn could adversely
    affect our business.



We
    rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of
    our senior management and scientific staff and if we are unable
    to retain these key employees and attract other highly skilled
    personnel necessary to grow our business successfully, our
    business and results of operations could suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued
    service of our executive officers, particularly our founder and
    chief executive officer, Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, and the
    managing director of our German subsidiary IPG Laser GmbH,
    Dr. Eugene Shcherbakov, our highly trained team of
    scientists, many of whom have numerous years of experience and
    specialized expertise in optical fibers, semiconductors and
    optical component technology, and other key engineering, sales,
    marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may
    leave, which could harm our business. The members of our
    scientific staff who are expected to make significant individual
    contributions to our business are also members of our executive
    management team as disclosed under Item 10,
    “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate
    Governance” below. Furthermore, our business requires
    scientists and engineers with experience in several disciplines,
    including physics, optics, materials sciences, chemistry and
    electronics. We will need to continue to recruit and retain
    highly skilled scientists and engineers for certain functions.
    Our future success also depends on our ability to identify,
    attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled
    research and development, managerial, operations, sales,
    marketing and customer service personnel. If we fail to attract,
    integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to
    extend and maintain our scientific expertise and grow our
    business could suffer significantly.

Failure
    to effectively build and expand our direct field service and
    support organization could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

We believe that it will become increasingly important for us to
    provide rapid, responsive service directly to our customers
    throughout the world and to build and expand our own personnel
    resources to provide these services. Any actual or perceived
    lack of direct field service in the locations where we sell or
    try to sell our products may negatively impact our sales efforts
    and, consequently, our revenues. Accordingly, we have an ongoing
    effort to develop our direct support systems in Asia, one of our
    largest markets. This requires us to recruit and train
    additional qualified field service and support personnel as well
    as maintain effective and highly trained organizations that can
    provide service to our customers in various countries. We may
    not be able to attract and train additional qualified personnel
    to expand our direct support operations successfully. We may not
    be able to find and engage additional qualified third-party
    resources to supplement and enhance our direct support
    operations. Further, we may incur significant costs in providing
    these direct field and support services. Failure to implement
    our direct support operation effectively could adversely affect
    our relationships with our customers, and our operating results
    may suffer.

The
    laser and amplifier industries are experiencing declining
    average selling prices, which could cause our gross margins to
    decline and harm our operating results.

Products in the laser and amplifier industries generally, and
    our products specifically, are experiencing and may in the
    future continue to experience a decline in average selling
    prices (ASPs) as a result of new product and technology
    introductions, increased competition and price pressures from
    significant customers. If the ASPs of our products decline
    further and we are unable to increase our unit volumes,
    introduce new or enhanced products with higher margins or reduce
    manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the
    prices of our existing products, our operating results may be
    adversely affected. In addition, because of our significant
    fixed costs, we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs
    quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Because of these
    factors, we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our
    future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis if the
    ASPs of our products continue to decline.

A few
    customers account for a significant portion of our sales, and if
    we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail
    their purchases of our products, our results of operations could
    be adversely affected.

We rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our
    sales. Our top five customers accounted for 17%, 20% and 29%. of
    our consolidated net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Our largest customer



accounted for 7%, 7% and 10% of sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. We generally do not enter into agreements with our
    customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or
    amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase
    orders and shipment schedules. If any of our principal customers
    discontinues its relationship with us, replaces us as a vendor
    for certain products or suffers downturns in its business, our
    business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We
    have experienced, and expect to experience in the future,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These
    fluctuations may increase the volatility of our stock
    price.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We believe that
    fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of
    our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. Factors
    which may have an influence on our operating results in a
    particular quarter include:

•

the increase, decrease, cancellation or rescheduling of
    significant customer orders;

•

the timing of revenue recognition based on the installation or
    acceptance of certain products shipped to our customers;

•

seasonality attributable to different purchasing patterns and
    levels of activity throughout the year in the areas where we
    operate;

•

the timing of customer qualification of our products and
    commencement of volume sales of systems that include our
    products;

•

the rate at which our present and future customers and end users
    adopt our technologies;

•

the gain or loss of a key customer;

•

product or customer mix;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

the relative proportions of our U.S. and international
    sales;

•

our ability to design, manufacture and introduce new products on
    a cost-effective and timely basis;

•

our ability to manage our inventory levels and any inventory
    write-downs;

•

the incurrence of expenses to develop and improve application
    and support capabilities, the benefits of which may not be
    realized until future periods, if at all;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

foreign currency fluctuations; and

•

our ability to control expenses.

These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict our
    operating results. In addition, our ability to accurately
    predict our operating results is complicated by the fact that
    many of our products have long sales cycles, some lasting as
    long as twelve months. Once a sale is made, our delivery
    schedule typically ranges from four weeks to four months, and
    therefore our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the
    same quarter that they are received and will not enhance our
    ability to predict our results for future quarters. In addition,
    long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses
    without offsetting revenues since customers typically expend
    significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our
    products before making a decision to purchase them. Moreover,
    customers may cancel or reschedule shipments, and production
    difficulties could delay shipments. Accordingly, our results of
    operations are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter
    to quarter, and we may not be able to accurately predict when
    these fluctuations will occur.



Foreign
    currency transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales,
    cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange
    losses.

We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of
    most countries in which we operate. In 2008, our net sales
    outside the United States represented a significant portion of
    our total sales. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one
    of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a
    sales transaction using a different currency from the currency
    in which it receives revenues. Changes in exchange rates can
    also affect our results of operations by changing the
    U.S. dollar value of sales and expenses denominated in
    foreign currencies. We cannot accurately predict the impact of
    future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.
    Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be
    able to effectively manage our currency transaction or
    translation risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates
    may increase the price of our products in local currency to our
    foreign customers, which may have an adverse effect on our
    financial condition, cash flows and profitability.

We
    depend on our OEM customers and system integrators and their
    ability to incorporate our products into their
    systems.

Our sales depend in part on our ability to maintain existing and
    secure new OEM customers. Our revenues also depend in part upon
    the ability of our current and potential OEM customers and
    system integrators to develop and sell systems that incorporate
    our laser and amplifier products. The commercial success of
    these systems depends to a substantial degree on the efforts of
    these OEM customers and system integrators to develop and market
    products that incorporate our technologies. Relationships and
    experience with traditional laser makers, limited marketing
    resources, reluctance to invest in research and development and
    other factors affecting these OEM customers and third-party
    system integrators could have a substantial impact upon our
    financial results. If OEM customers or integrators are not able
    to adapt existing tools or develop new systems to take advantage
    of the features and benefits of fiber lasers, then the
    opportunities to increase our revenues and profitability may be
    severely limited or delayed. Furthermore, if our OEM customers
    or third-party system integrators experience financial or other
    difficulties that adversely affect their operations, our
    financial condition or results of operations may also be
    adversely affected.

The
    markets for our products are highly competitive and increased
    competition could increase our costs, reduce our sales or cause
    us to lose market share.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by
    significant price and technological competition. Our fiber laser
    and amplifier products compete with conventional laser
    technologies and amplifier products offered by several
    well-established companies, some of which are larger and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do. Also, we compete with widely used
    non-laser production methods, such as resistance welding. We
    believe that competition will be particularly intense from
    makers of
    CO


and YAG lasers, as these makers of conventional solutions may
    lower prices to maintain current market share and have committed
    significant research and development resources to pursue
    opportunities related to these technologies.

In addition, we face competition from a growing number of fiber
    laser makers, including Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf
    GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc., Coherent Inc., Newport
    Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., Keopsys SA,
    Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi Unitek Corporation,
    MPB Communications Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corporation.
    Competition from other fiber laser makers has increased and
    several have announced plans to introduce high-power fiber
    lasers that would compete with our products. We may not be able
    to successfully differentiate our current and proposed products
    from our competitors’ products and current or prospective
    customers may not consider our products to be superior to
    competitors’ products. To maintain our competitive
    position, we believe that we will be required to continue a high
    level of investment in research and development, application
    development and customer service and support, and to react to
    market pricing conditions. Many of the laser companies that we
    compete with are larger and have substantially greater
    financial, managerial and technical resources, more extensive
    distribution and service networks, greater sales and marketing
    capacity, and larger installed customer bases than we do.



We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these
    investments and we may not be able to make the technological
    advances or price adjustments necessary to maintain our
    competitive position. We also compete against our OEM
    customers’ internal production of competitive laser
    technologies.

Our
    inability to manage risks associated with our international
    customers and operations could adversely affect our
    business.

Our products are currently marketed and sold in numerous
    countries. The United States, Germany, Japan, Russia and China
    are our principal markets. A significant amount of our revenues
    are derived from customers outside of the United States. We
    anticipate that foreign sales will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
    Our operations and sales in these markets are subject to risks
    inherent in international business activities, including:

•

longer accounts receivable collection periods;

•

fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies;

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s economic
    conditions, such as recession;

•

compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and
    regulations and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory
    requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs,
    quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade
    barriers;

•

certification requirements;

•

environmental regulations;

•

less effective protection of intellectual property rights in
    some countries;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts,
    and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in
    the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers,
    manufacturers and subcontractors are located;

•

preference for locally produced products;

•

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international
    operations across different geographic areas and cultures;

•

seasonal reductions in business activities; and

•

fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.

Political and economic instability and changes in governmental
    regulations could adversely affect both our ability to
    effectively operate our foreign sales offices and the ability of
    our foreign suppliers to supply us with required materials or
    services. Any interruption or delay in the supply of our
    required components, products, materials or services, or our
    inability to obtain these components, materials, products or
    services from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within
    a reasonable amount of time, could impair our ability to meet
    scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause
    customers to cancel orders.

We are also subject to risks of doing business in Russia through
    our subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, which provides components and
    test equipment to us and sells finished fiber devices to
    customers in Russia and neighboring countries. The results of
    operations, business prospects and facilities of NTO IRE-Polus
    are subject to the economic and political environment in Russia.
    In recent years Russia has undergone substantial political,
    economic and social change. As is typical of an emerging market,
    Russia does not possess a well-developed business, legal and
    regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more
    mature free market economy. In addition, the tax, currency and
    customs legislation within Russia is subject to varying



interpretations and changes, which can occur frequently. The
    future economic direction of Russia remains largely dependent
    upon the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary
    measures undertaken by the government, together with tax, legal,
    regulatory and political developments. Our failure to manage the
    risks associated with NTO IRE-Polus and our other existing and
    potential future international business operations could have a
    material adverse effect upon our results of operations.

Our
    products could contain defects, which may reduce sales of those
    products, harm market acceptance of our fiber laser products or
    result in claims against us.

The manufacture of our fiber lasers and amplifiers involves
    highly complex and precise processes. Despite testing by us and
    our customers, errors have been found, and may be found in the
    future, in our products. These defects may cause us to incur
    significant warranty, support and repair costs, incur additional
    costs related to a recall, divert the attention of our
    engineering personnel from our product development efforts and
    harm our relationships with our customers. These problems could
    result in, among other things, loss of revenues or a delay in
    revenue recognition, loss of market share, harm to our
    reputation or a delay or loss of market acceptance of our fiber
    laser products. Defects, integration issues or other performance
    problems in our fiber laser and amplifier products could also
    result in personal injury or financial or other damages to our
    customers, which in turn could damage market acceptance of our
    products. Our customers could also seek damages from us for
    their losses. A product liability claim brought against us, even
    if unsuccessful, could be time-consuming and costly to defend.

We may
    pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses, products,
    patents or technologies. These may involve risks which could
    disrupt our business and may harm our financial
    condition.

We currently have no binding commitments or agreements to make
    any acquisitions and have limited experience in making
    acquisitions. In the future, we may make acquisitions of and
    investments in new businesses, products, patents, technologies
    and geographic areas, or we may acquire operations, products or
    technologies that expand our current capabilities. Acquisitions
    present a number of potential risks and challenges that could,
    if not met, disrupt our business operations, increase our
    operating costs and reduce the value of the acquired company,
    asset or technology to us. For example, if we identify an
    acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully
    negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms. Even if
    we are successful, we may not be able to integrate the acquired
    businesses, products, patents or technologies into our existing
    business and products. As a result of the rapid pace of
    technological change in our industry, we may misjudge the
    long-term potential of an acquired business, product, patent or
    technology, or the acquisition may not be complementary to our
    existing business. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and
    investments, whether or not consummated, may divert our
    management’s attention and require considerable cash
    outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition,
    to complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities,
    incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization
    expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could
    adversely affect our profitability and result in dilution to our
    existing and future stockholders.

We are
    subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could
    impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial
    condition.

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various
    federal, state, local and international laws governing the
    environment, including those relating to the storage, use,
    discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, and
    human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We could incur
    costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party
    property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required
    to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we
    were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.
    Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and
    without regard to comparative fault. Compliance with current or
    future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our
    ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire
    additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing
    processes, or incur other significant expenses in order to
    remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. At this
    time, we do not believe the costs to maintain compliance with
    current environmental laws to be material. Although we do not
    currently anticipate that such costs will become material, if
    such costs were to become material in



the future, whether due to unanticipated changes in
    environmental laws, unanticipated changes in our operations or
    other unanticipated changes, we may be required to dedicate
    additional staff or financial resources in order to maintain
    compliance. There can be no assurance that violations of
    environmental laws or regulations will not occur in the future
    as a result of the inability to obtain permits, human error,
    accident, equipment failure or other causes.

We are
    subject to export control regulations that could restrict our
    ability to increase our international sales and may adversely
    affect our business.

A significant part of our business involves the export of our
    products to other countries. The U.S. government has in
    place a number of laws and regulations that control the export,
    re-export or transfer of

U.S.-origin

products, software and technology. The governments of other
    countries in which we do business have similar regulations
    regarding products, software and technology originating in those
    countries. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain
    a license before we can export, re-export or transfer certain
    products, software or technology. The requirement to obtain a
    license could put us at a competitive disadvantage by
    restricting our ability to sell products to customers in certain
    countries or by giving rise to delays or expenses related to
    obtaining a license. In applying for a license and responding to
    questions from licensing authorities, we have experienced and,
    in the future, may experience delays in obtaining export
    licenses based on issues solely within the control of the
    applicable government agency. Under the discretion of the
    issuing government agency, an export license may permit the
    export of one unit to a single customer or multiple units to one
    or more customers. Licenses may also include conditions that
    limit the use, resale, transfer, re-export, modification,
    disassembly, or transfer of a product, software or technology
    after it is exported without first obtaining permission from the
    relevant government agency. Failure to comply with these laws
    and regulations could result in government sanctions, including
    substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges,
    debarment from government contracts and a loss of revenues.
    Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain required export
    licenses also may require us to defer shipments for substantial
    periods or cancel orders. Any of these circumstances could
    adversely affect our operations and, as a result, our financial
    results could suffer.

Our
    ability to access financial markets to finance a portion of our
    working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs may
    be adversely affected by factors beyond our control and could
    negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet
    certain obligations or implement our operating
    strategy.

We occasionally borrow under our existing credit facilities to
    fund operations, including working capital investments. Our
    major credit lines in the U.S. and Germany expire in July
    2011 and June 2010, respectively. Market disruptions such as
    those currently being experienced in the United States and
    abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt
    markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive,
    and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of
    certain types of financing. Continued uncertainty in the
    financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access
    additional financing or to refinance our existing credit
    facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or
    at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund
    current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and
    development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the
    financial services industry, unprecedented volatility in the
    markets where our outstanding securities trade, and general
    economic downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are
    unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our
    short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to
    finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and
    implement our operating strategy could be adversely affected.

Our
    ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our
    failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from
    growing.

We may in the future be required to raise capital through public
    or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may
    not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure
    to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional
    equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common
    stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
    covenants and could reduce our



profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we
    may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive
    pressures.

Dr. Valentin
    P. Gapontsev, our chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
    principal stockholder, controls approximately 45% of our voting
    power and has a significant influence on the outcome of director
    elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval,
    including a change in corporate control.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, our Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer, and IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd. (IPFD), of which
    Dr. Gapontsev is the managing director and majority owner,
    beneficially own approximately 45% of our common stock. In
    addition, Dr. Denis Gapontsev, our Vice President of
    Research and Development and the son of Dr. Valentin P.
    Gapontsev, beneficially owns approximately 3% of our common
    stock, and collectively with Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev,
    approximately 47% of our common stock. As a result,
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev has a significant influence on
    the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including:

•

election of our directors;

•

amendment of our certificate of incorporation or
    by-laws; and

•

approval of mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev may vote his shares of our common
    stock in ways that are adverse to the interests of other holders
    of our common stock. Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev’s
    significant ownership interest could delay, prevent or cause a
    change in control of our company, any of which could adversely
    affect the market price of our common stock.

Anti-takeover
    provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could
    prevent or delay a change in control of our company, even if a
    change in control would be beneficial to our
    stockholders.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws,
    including certain provisions that will take effect when
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev (together with his affiliates and
    associates) ceases to beneficially own an aggregate of 25% or
    more of our outstanding voting securities, may discourage, delay
    or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control, even if
    it would be beneficial to our stockholders. The existence of
    these provisions could also limit the price that investors might
    be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
    These provisions include:

•

authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred
    stock;

•

establishing a classified board;

•

providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

•

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;

•

limiting the persons who may call a special meeting of
    stockholders;

•

establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for
    election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to
    be submitted to a stockholder vote; and

•

supermajority stockholder approval to change these provisions.

Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent
    someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining
    control of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law, which will apply to our
    company following such time as Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev
    (together with his affiliates and associates) ceases to
    beneficially own 25% or more of the total voting power of our
    outstanding shares, may prohibit business combinations with
    stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.



Substantial
    sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to
    decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the
    perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008,
    we had 44,965,960 shares of common stock outstanding and
    3,050,301 shares subject to outstanding options. All of our
    unregistered shares of our common stock are now eligible for
    sale under Rule 144, Rule 144(k) or Rule 701. We
    have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue
    under our stock option plans and our employee stock ownership
    plan. As these shares are issued, they may be freely sold in the
    public market, subject to the

lock-up

restrictions described above, and subject, in the case of any
    awards under our stock-based compensation plans, to applicable
    vesting requirements.

We
    incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of
    complying with the laws and regulations affecting public
    companies, which could adversely affect our operating
    results.

As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and
    other expenses that we did not incur as a private company,
    including costs associated with public company reporting
    requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs
    associated with recently adopted corporate governance
    requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002, as well as new rules implemented by the SEC and the
    Nasdaq Global Market. The expenses incurred by public companies
    generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have
    been increasing. These rules and regulations have significantly
    increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our legal
    and financial compliance costs and have made some activities
    more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations have
    also made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain
    director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required
    to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
    substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar
    coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to
    attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board
    of directors or as our executive officers.

If
    securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about
    our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our
    stock could decline.

The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the
    research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish
    about us. If one or more of these analysts who do cover us
    downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
    Further, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our
    company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn
    could cause our stock price to decline.

We are negotiating a lease renewal and expect this lease to be

We are expanding our facilities in Massachusetts by adding
    approximately 77,000 square feet at facilities that we own.
    The additional space will be used primarily for manufacturing
    and administration.

We maintain our corporate headquarters in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    and conduct research and development in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    Burbach, Germany and Fryazino, Russia. We operate four
    manufacturing facilities for lasers, amplifiers and components,
    which are located in the United States, Germany, Russia and
    Italy. We also manufacture certain optical components and
    systems in India and China. We are committed to meeting
    internationally recognized manufacturing standards. Our
    facilities in the United States and Germany are ISO 9001
    certified and we have ISO certification in Russia for specific
    products. We have sales personnel at each of our manufacturing
    facilities, and at offices in Novi, Michigan; Santa Clara,
    California; London, England; Illkirch, France; Yokohama and
    Chibu, Japan; Daejeon, South Korea; Bangalore, India; Beijing,
    China; and Singapore.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our
    current needs and that we will be able to obtain additional
    commercial space as needed.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings and
    other disputes incidental to our business, including those
    described below. For a discussion of the risks associated with
    these legal proceedings and other disputes, see Item 1A.
    “Risk Factors — We are subject to litigation
    alleging that we are infringing third-party intellectual
    property rights. Intellectual property claims could result in
    costly litigation and harm our business.” In November 2006,
    IMRA America, Inc. filed an action against us alleging that
    certain products we produce, including but not limited to our
    continuous wave and pulsed fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers,
    which account for a significant portion of our revenues,
    infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA America.
    IMRA America alleges willful infringement and seeks damages of
    at least $10 million, treble damages and injunctive relief.
    IMRA America also alleges inducement of infringement and
    contributory infringement. This lawsuit concerns products made,
    used, sold or offered for sale in or imported into the United
    States and therefore the lawsuit affects products that account
    for a substantial portion of our revenues. We filed an answer in
    which we denied infringement and raised additional defenses that
    the patent is invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we filed
    declaratory judgment counterclaims based on these three
    defenses. This lawsuit does not affect revenues that are derived
    from products that are not made, used, sold or offered for sale
    in or imported into the United States. In June 2008, the USPTO
    ordered re-examination of the patent claims asserted by



IMRA America, Inc. against the Company based on several prior
    art references that we submitted in an

ex parte

re-examination request. The U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Michigan had previously stayed the
    litigation until the conclusion of the re-examination. We intend
    to vigorously contest the claims against us, but we cannot
    predict the outcome of the proceeding.

In February 2008, CardioFocus Inc. filed an action against us
    alleging that our erbium and thulium fiber lasers infringe one
    patent allegedly owned by CardioFocus and seeks unspecified
    damages, treble damages and attorneys’ fees for alleged
    willful infringement. CardioFocus also alleges inducement of
    infringement. The patent claims generally relate to a system for
    transmitting laser energy via an optical fiber to a surgical
    site. The patent expired in April 2007. We filed an answer in
    which we denied infringement and raised additional defenses that
    the patent is invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we filed
    declaratory judgment counterclaims based on these three
    defenses. Also, CardioFocus recently alleged that the Company
    infringes claims of two additional patents and we are
    investigating a response to such allegations. The USPTO granted
    the reexamination requests submitted by us and other defendants.
    In two office actions in November 2008, the USPTO rejected all
    of the claims for the CardioFocus patents alleged to be
    infringed. In February 2009, CardioFocus responded to the USPTO
    office actions. The U.S. District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts has stayed the litigation until the earlier of
    October 2009 or the conclusion of the re-examination. The Court
    indicated that it will consider extending the stay for an
    additional year if the re-examinations are not completed in one
    year. Discovery has not yet commenced. We intend to vigorously
    contest the claims against us, but we cannot predict the outcome
    of the proceeding.

Dividends

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital
    stock. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to
    support operations and to finance the growth and development of
    our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends
    in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends
    will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking
    into account any business conditions, any contractual and legal
    restrictions on our payment of dividends, and our financial
    condition, operating results, cash needs and growth plans. In
    addition, current agreements with certain of our lenders
    contain, and future loan agreements may contain, restrictive
    covenants that generally prohibit us from paying cash dividends,
    making any distribution on any class of stock or making stock
    repurchases.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from
    Registered Securities

During the past three years, we have sold and issued the
    following unregistered securities:

1. In connection with our initial public offering, all
    outstanding shares of our series A preferred stock
    converted in to 359,463 shares of our common stock, all
    outstanding shares of our series B preferred stock
    converted into 7,252,927 shares of our common stock and all
    outstanding shares of our series D preferred stock
    converted into 1,683,168 shares of our common stock.

2. Since January 1, 2006, we granted options to
    purchase 1,213,913 shares of our common stock at exercise
    prices ranging from $3.41 to $9.60 per share to employees,
    consultants and directors under our 2000 Incentive Compensation
    Plan, our 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan and our Non-Employee
    Directors Stock Plan. From January 1, 2006 through
    December 31, 2008, we issued 705,501 unregistered shares of
    our common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options for
    aggregate consideration of $1.5 million.

3. In December 2008, we issued 50,680 shares of common
    stock as partial payment of the purchase price for the 20%
    minority interest in IPG Fibertech, S.r.l. that we did not
    previously own. The shares were valued at $13.05 per share, the
    closing price on November 17, 2008.

The sales of securities described in items (1) and
    (3) above were deemed to be exempt from registration
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
    Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an
    issuer not involving a public offering. Each of these sales was
    to “accredited investors,” as such term is defined in
    Rule 501 of Regulation D. Each of the recipients of
    securities in the transactions deemed to be exempt from
    registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    received written disclosures that the securities had not been
    registered under the Securities Act and that any resale must be
    made pursuant to a registration or an available exemption from
    such registration. The issuances of the securities described in
    item (2) above were deemed to be exempt from registration
    pursuant to either Rule 701 promulgated under the
    Securities Act as a transaction pursuant to compensatory benefit
    plans approved by our board of directors or, where such
    recipients of securities under these compensatory plans were
    “accredited investors” because the recipients were
    directors or executive officers of our company, under
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an
    issuer not involving a public offering. None of the sales of the
    securities described in items (1), (2) and (3) above
    involved the use of an underwriter, and no commissions were paid
    in connection with the sale of any of the securities that we
    issued. The sales of these securities were made without general
    solicitation or advertising.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, there were no
    repurchases made by us or on our behalf, or by any
    “affiliated purchasers,” of shares of our common stock.

    options were non-qualified stock options to purchase common
    stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. These options
    vested immediately and expire in March 2010.



ITEM 6.

SELECTED

The change in value of the series B warrants is a non-cash
    charge related to recording the increase or decrease in the fair
    value of the warrants prior to their conversion in December
    2006. The change in fair value for this derivative instrument
    was directly related to the probability that the warrants would
    be exercised prior to their expiration in April 2008. We used a
    portion of the net proceeds from our IPO to repurchase the
    series B warrants.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with Item 6, “Selected Consolidated
    Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements
    and related notes included in this Annual Report of

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
    materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
    statements as a result of certain factors including, but not
    limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors.”

Overview

We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance
    fiber lasers for diverse applications in numerous markets. Fiber
    lasers are a new generation of lasers that combine the
    advantages of semiconductor diodes, such as long life and high
    efficiency, with the high amplification and precise beam
    qualities of specialty optical fibers to deliver superior
    performance, reliability and usability at a generally lower
    total cost of ownership compared to conventional
    CO


and crystal lasers. Our products are displacing conventional
    lasers in many current applications and enabling new
    applications for lasers.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, advanced,
    communications and medical applications. We sell our products
    globally to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system
    integrators and end users. We market our products
    internationally primarily through our direct sales force and
    also through agreements with independent sales representatives
    and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States,
    Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, South
    Korea, Singapore, India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture
    most key components used in our finished products, from
    semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber
    lasers and amplifiers. Our vertically integrated operations
    allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, ensure access to
    critical components and rapidly develop and integrate advanced
    products while protecting our proprietary technology.

Since our formation in 1990 in Russia, we have been focused on
    developing and manufacturing high-power fiber lasers and
    amplifiers. We established manufacturing and research operations
    in Germany in 1994 and in the United States in 1998. In the
    following years, we developed numerous OEM customer
    relationships for our advanced, active fiber-based products and
    generated a substantial majority of our sales from
    communications companies. Despite the significant economic
    downturn in the communications industry during 2001 and 2002, we
    invested in developing and manufacturing our own semiconductor
    diodes, one of our



highest-cost components, rather than purchasing them from
    third-party vendors. Also, we developed new products with higher
    output levels, targeting new applications and markets outside of
    the communications industry, particularly materials processing,
    which is now the largest market for our products.

In December 2006, we completed our IPO of 10,350,000 shares
    of common stock at $16.50 per share, comprised of 6,241,379
    primary shares and 4,108,621 shares offered by selling
    stockholders. In connection with the IPO, all of the outstanding
    shares of our preferred stock were converted into an aggregate
    of 9,295,558 shares of common stock.

Description
    of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses

Net sales.

We derive net sales primarily from
    the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode
    lasers, communications systems and complementary products. We
    develop our products to standard specifications and use a common
    set of components within our product architectures. We sell our
    products through our direct sales organization and our network
    of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system
    integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials
    processing laser systems, communications systems and medical
    laser systems to end users. We also sell our products to end
    users that build their own systems which incorporate our
    products or use our products as an energy or light source. Sales
    of our products generally are recognized upon shipment, provided
    that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured.

Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a
    few weeks to as long as one year or more. Our scientists and
    engineers work closely with OEMs and end users to analyze their
    system requirements and select and meet appropriate
    specifications. Our major products are based upon a common
    technology platform. We continually enhance these and other
    products by improving their components as well as by developing
    new components. Although it is difficult to predict the life
    cycles of our products and what stage of the life cycle our
    products are in, we estimate that our major products are in the
    early stages of their life cycles. Our sales typically are made
    on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase
    commitments.

The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as
    the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as
    increased competition, the introduction of new products,
    increases in unit volumes and market share considerations. In
    the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to
    penetrate new markets and applications in which previously it
    was not economically feasible for customers to deploy our
    products. Furthermore, we offer volume discounts to customers
    who buy multiple units. We cannot predict the timing and degree
    of these price declines.

Cost of sales.

Our cost of sales consists
    primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct
    labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically
    integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for
    our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe
    our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies,
    leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales
    also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our
    manufacturing and engineering operations, related occupancy and
    equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory
    obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are
    written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as
    excess or obsolete.

Due to our vertical integration strategy, we maintain a
    relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not adjust
    these fixed costs quickly enough to adapt to rapidly changing
    market conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as
    a percentage of net sales, is greatly impacted by our sales
    volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing
    overhead expenses. Therefore, reductions in sales volumes
    generally decrease our gross profit. Additionally, because many
    of our products are customized, we are frequently required to
    devote significant engineering resources to the sales process,
    which we also include in cost of product sales as incurred.

Sales and marketing.

Our sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of compensation, costs of
    advertising, trade shows, professional and technical
    conferences, promotions, travel related to our sales and
    marketing operations, related occupancy and demonstration
    equipment costs and other marketing costs.



Research and development.

Our research and
    development expense consists primarily of compensation, test and
    development expenses related to the design of our products and
    certain components, and facilities costs. We use a common
    research and development platform for our products. Costs
    related to product development are recorded as research and
    development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

General and administrative.

Our general and
    administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and
    associated costs for executive management, finance, legal and
    other administrative personnel, outside legal and professional
    fees, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses.

Minority interests in consolidated
    subsidiaries.

Our financial statements
    consolidate the financial results of our subsidiaries, including
    the subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by us. We own all of
    the stock of our subsidiaries, except for 34% of our Russian
    subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, 20% of our Japanese subsidiary, IPG
    Photonics (Japan) Ltd. (IPG Japan), and 10% of our South Korean
    subsidiary, IPG Photonics (Korea) Ltd. We reduce or increase our
    net income by the net income or loss, respectively, attributable
    to the minority ownership interest in such subsidiaries.

Factors
    and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial
    Results

In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the
    following factors and trends that our management believes are
    important in understanding our financial performance.

Net sales.

From 2003 to 2008, our net sales
    grew from $33.7 million to $229.1 million,
    representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 47%.
    The principal drivers of our net sales growth have been
    (i) introduction of new products, including our high-power
    lasers, and increasing demand for our products, fueled by the
    decreasing average cost per watt of output power, (ii) the
    expansion of our product line into higher output power levels,
    (iii) the growing market acceptance of fiber lasers, and
    (iv) the development of new applications for our products
    and new OEM customer relationships. Our annual revenue growth
    rates have decreased from 80% in 2004 to 59% in 2005, 49% in
    2006, 32% in 2007, and 21% in 2008. Furthermore, during 2008 our
    growth rate decreased over prior year levels from the first half
    to the second half from 27% to 17%, respectively. Uncertainties
    surrounding current economic conditions also make it difficult
    to predict sales in 2009.

Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by
    our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials
    processing market, which include automotive, marking,
    electronics and photovoltaic applications. Approximately 82% of
    our revenues in 2008 were from customers in the materials
    processing market. Although applications in this marketplace are
    broad, sales for these applications are cyclical and have
    historically experienced sudden and severe downturns and periods
    of oversupply, resulting in significantly reduced demand for
    capital equipment, including the products that we manufacture
    and market. For the foreseeable future, our operations will
    continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in
    this market, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for their
    products or services. Decreased demand for products and services
    from customers for these applications during an economic
    downturn may lead to decreased demand for our products, which
    would reduce our sales or sales growth rate.

Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to
    quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter
    can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers,
    the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our
    customers’ facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time
    orders for products with large purchase prices, and seasonal
    factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity
    throughout the year in the regions where we operate.
    Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half
    of the year than in the first half of the year. Furthermore, net
    sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products
    for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve.
    The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification
    in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a
    period, which may then slow until we further penetrate new
    markets or obtain new customers.

Gross margin.

In the last three years our
    gross margins have increased from 44.2% in 2006 to 45.0% in 2007
    and 46.8% in 2008.



Our total gross margin in any period can be affected by total
    net sales in any period, product mix, that is, the percentage of
    our revenue in that period that is attributable to higher or
    lower-power products, and by other factors, some of which are
    not under our control. Our product mix affects our margins
    because the selling price per watt is higher for low and
    mid-power devices than for high-power devices. The overall cost
    of high-power lasers may be partially offset by improved
    absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales of
    larger volumes of higher-power products.

Due to the fact that we have significant fixed costs, our costs
    are difficult to adjust in response to changes in demand. In
    addition, our fixed costs will increase as we expand our
    capacity. Gross margins generally have improved because of
    greater absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales
    of larger volumes of higher-power products. However, if sales
    decline or if we have production issues or inventory
    write-downs, our gross margins could be negatively affected, and
    could be more volatile period to period than in the past.

We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow
    moving, have been rendered obsolete or determined to be excess,
    and any write-off of such slow moving, obsolete or excess
    inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded
    provisions for inventory totaling $3.8 million,
    $2.5 million and $1.0 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The factors that can influence the gross margins derived from
    sales of any individual product include the following:

•

factors that affect the prices we can charge, including the
    features and performance of our products, their output power,
    the nature of the end user and application, and competitive
    pressures;

•

factors that affect the cost of our net sales, including the
    cost of raw materials and components, manufacturing costs and
    shipping costs;

•

production volumes and yields of specific product lines or
    components; and

•

in the case of our OEM customers, the type of market that they
    serve and the competitive pricing pressures faced by our OEM
    customers.

Cost of diodes.

Prior to 2004, we used
    semiconductor diodes purchased from a third-party supplier. In
    2004, we began production at our semiconductor diode
    manufacturing facility, which enabled us to significantly reduce
    the cost of our semiconductor diodes and eliminate reliance upon
    suppliers for this component. For many of our products,
    particularly at higher power levels, the cost of diodes is the
    most important factor in determining the price of the product.
    In addition, we have increased the output power of individual
    semiconductor diodes and diode packages, further reducing our
    cost per watt.

Sales and marketing expense.

We have expanded
    our worldwide direct sales organization and applications centers
    around the world, hired additional personnel involved in
    marketing in our existing and new geographic locations,
    increased the number of units used for demonstration purposes,
    and otherwise increased expenditures on sales and marketing
    activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. We
    expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing
    resources and such costs may increase in the aggregate. However,
    the rate of growth in such costs is not expected to be as high
    as rates experienced in previous years.

Research and development expense.

We plan to
    continue to invest in research and development to improve our
    existing components and products and develop new components and
    products, such as diodes, gas lasers and visible lasers. The
    amount of research and development expenses we incur may vary
    period to period.

General and administrative expense.

We have
    increased our general and administrative expenses and expanded
    headcount to support the growth of our company and to comply
    with public company reporting obligations and regulatory
    requirements, incurred higher insurance expenses related to
    directors’ and officers’ insurance and invested in our
    financial reporting systems. We expect future increases in
    general and administrative expenses to be limited, however the
    timing and amount of litigation related expenses may vary
    substantially from quarter to quarter in response to unforeseen
    circumstances and events.



Major customers.

We have historically depended
    on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net
    sales. The composition of this group can change from year to
    year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a
    percentage of our annual net sales were 29% in 2006, 20% in 2007
    and 17% in 2008. Sales to our largest customer accounted for
    10%, 7% and 7% of our net sales in 2006, 2007 and 2008,
    respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our
    relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the
    composition of our net sales to our significant customers will
    continue to change. If any of our significant customers were to
    substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would
    be adversely affected.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales
    and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are
    subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing
    basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those
    related to inventories, income taxes and the fair value of
    certain debt and equity instruments including stock-based
    compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on our
    historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe
    are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
    form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates, which may result in material effects on our operating
    results and financial position. The accounting policies
    described below are those which, in our opinion, involve the
    most significant application of judgment, or involve complex
    estimation, and which could, if different judgments or estimates
    were made, materially affect our reported results of operations
    and financial position.

Revenue recognition.

Our net sales are
    generated from sales of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, diode
    lasers and complementary products. Our products are used in a
    wide range of applications by different types of end users or
    used as components or integrated into systems by OEMs or system
    integrators, and are often used as sub-assemblies required for
    end products manufactured by or for the customer. We also sell
    communications systems that include our fiber lasers and
    amplifiers as components.

We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”
    SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria be met
    before revenue can be recognized: (i) persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or
    services have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or
    determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue from the sale of our products is generally
    recognized upon shipment, provided that the other revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. We have no obligation to
    provide upgrades, enhancements or customer support subsequent to
    the sale, other than warranty.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. We defer the revenue on multiple element arrangements if
    the fair values of all the undelivered elements are not known or
    if customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of specified
    items or performance conditions, if the performance conditions
    cannot be satisfactorily tested prior to shipment or if the
    Company has not met such conditions in the past. Applicable
    revenue recognition criteria are then applied separately to each
    separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. We receive a customer purchase
    order or contract as evidence of an arrangement and product
    shipment terms are typically free on board (F.O.B.) shipping
    point. Periodically, our revenue arrangements include customer
    acceptance clauses. Revenue is deferred until customer
    acceptance has been obtained.

Inventory.

Inventory is stated at the lower of
    cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Inventory includes parts and
    components that may be specialized in nature and subject to
    rapid obsolescence. We



maintain a reserve for inventory items to provide for an
    estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory. The reserve is
    based upon a review of inventory materials on hand, which we
    compare with estimated future usage and age. In addition, we
    review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates
    of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to reduce the
    carrying value to the net realizable value with respect to any
    part with costs in excess of current market value. Estimating
    demand and current market values is inherently difficult,
    particularly given that we make unique components and products.
    We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by
    making our best estimate considering the current quantities of
    inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this
    inventory to support future sales of our products. We often have
    limited information on which to base our forecasts. If future
    sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and
    obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory
    provisions may be required. Because of the Company’s
    vertical integration, as significant or sudden decrease in sales
    could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess
    or obsolete inventory. We recorded inventory charges of
    $3.8 million, $2.5 million and $1.0 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Compensation costs for all share-based payment awards granted
    subsequent to January 1, 2006 are recognized based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). We allocate and record
    stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period.

Under SFAS No. 123(R), we calculate the fair value of
    stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. Determining the appropriate fair value model and
    calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require
    the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
    life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price
    volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value
    of stock-based payment awards represent management’s best
    estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
    the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors
    change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based
    compensation expense could be materially different in the
    future. The weighted average assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model were as follows for the years ended December
    31:

The weighted average expected option term for awards granted in
    2007 and 2006 reflects the application of the simplified method
    set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
    Bulletin, or SAB, No. 107. The simplified method defines
    the life as the average of the contractual term of the options
    and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches.
    Commencing in 2008, the Company began to use historic exercise
    activities of its own stock options as well as projections based
    on historic experience.

Because the Company’s common stock has been publicly traded
    since December 2006, there is a lack of sufficient
    company-specific historical and implied volatility information.
    The Company based its estimate of expected volatility on the
    expected volatility of similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available. The



Company used the following factors to identify similar public
    entities: industry, stage of life cycle, size and profitability.
    The Company intends to continue to consistently apply this
    process using the same or similar entities until a sufficient
    amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its
    own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances
    change such that the identified entities are no longer similar
    to the Company. In this latter case, more suitable, similar
    entities whose share prices are publicly available would be
    utilized in the calculation.

As stock-based compensation expense recorded in our statements
    of operations is based on options ultimately expected to vest,
    it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    stock-based compensation reflects an estimated forfeiture rate
    of 5% annually.

In 2008 the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan
    covering its U.S. employees. The plan allows employees who
    participate to purchase shares of common stock through payroll
    deductions at a 15% discount to the lower of the stock price on
    the first day or last day of the six-month purchase period.
    Payroll deductions may not exceed 10% of the employee’s
    compensation. Compensation expense related to the employee stock
    purchase plan for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    approximately $67,000.

Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes.

Our annual
    tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax
    planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate.

We file federal and state income tax returns in the United
    States and tax returns in nine international jurisdictions. We
    must estimate our income tax expense after considering, among
    other factors, differing tax rates between jurisdictions,
    allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes
    in enacted tax rates. Significant judgment is required in
    determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax
    positions. As we continue to expand globally, there is a risk
    that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various
    jurisdictions in which we do business, a governmental agency may
    disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes.
    Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the
    foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations
    where the tax treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is
    different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that
    the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another
    jurisdiction.

A 1% change in our 2008 effective income tax rate would have the
    effect of changing net income by approximately $566,000, or
    $0.01 per diluted share after tax.

Deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” The tax effects of these
    temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and
    deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At
    December 31, 2008, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of
    $5,649,000. If insufficient evidence of our ability to generate
    future taxable income arises, we may be required to record a
    valuation allowance against these assets, which will result in
    additional income tax expense. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate
    whether the deferred tax assets may be realized in the future
    and assess the need for a valuation allowance.

We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax
    authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues.
    Prior to 2007, these reserves were recorded when management
    determined that it was probable that a loss would be incurred
    related to these matters and the amount of the loss was
    reasonably determinable. In 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

As a result, reserves recorded subsequent to adoption are
    based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax
    benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is
    “more likely than not” to be realized following
    resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the
    tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised
    by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties
    associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a
    component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately
    $1,672,000, that if recognized would be recorded as a reduction
    in income tax expense.

Additionally, undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are
    accounted for as a temporary difference, except that deferred
    tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a
    foreign subsidiary that are deemed



to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction. We
    have formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of
    undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2008 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net sales.

Net sales increased by
    $40.4 million, or 21.4%, to $229.1 million in 2008
    from $188.7 million in 2007. This increase was attributable
    to higher sales of fiber lasers in materials processing
    applications where net sales increased by $47.7 million, or
    34.0%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales
    in medical applications of $6.7 million, or 64.1%, advanced
    applications of $0.4 million, or 1.5%, and communications
    applications, where net sales decreased by $0.2 million, or
    1.2%. The growth in materials processing applications sales
    resulted primarily from increased sales of medium-power lasers
    and pulsed lasers and continued market penetration for
    high-power fiber lasers, which increased by 55.5%, 37.5% and
    29.4%,



respectively. The decrease in sales of medical applications and
    low-power lasers was due to lower sales to our largest medical
    application customer in the United States.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of sales
    increased by $18.1 million, or 17.4%, to
    $121.8 million in 2008 from $103.7 million in 2007, as
    a result of increased sales volume. Our gross margin increased
    to 46.8% in 2008 from 45.0% in 2007. The increase in gross
    margin resulted from favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing
    costs due to higher production volumes and favorable product
    mix, particularly related to pulsed and medium-power lasers.
    These products have a higher selling price of output power per
    watt and higher gross margins. These benefits were partially
    offset by inventory write-downs of $3.8 million compared to
    $2.5 million in 2007 and an increase in depreciation
    related to facilities and equipment of $2.5 million in 2008.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $3.8 million, or 37.6%, to
    $13.9 million in 2008 from $10.1 million in 2007,
    primarily as a result of an increase of $1.8 million in
    personnel costs and $0.5 million in premises costs related
    to a larger worldwide direct sales organization, including our
    new sales and applications facilities in China, Japan and the
    United States (Michigan) and additional sales personnel
    worldwide. Additionally, the increase resulted from a
    $0.6 million increase in depreciation related to facilities
    and units used for demonstration purposes. As a percentage of
    sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 6.1% in 2008
    compared to 5.4% in 2007.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $6.3 million, or 65.9%, to
    $15.8 million in 2008 from $9.5 million in 2007. This
    increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.6 million
    in personnel costs and $2.1 million in materials used for
    research and development projects. During 2008, we increased the
    number of personnel performing research and development
    activities in the United States, Germany and Russia. Research
    and development activity continues to focus on enhancing the
    performance of our internally manufactured components, refining
    production processes to improve manufacturing yields and the
    development of new products. As a percentage of sales, research
    and development expense increased to 6.9% in 2008 from 5.0% in
    2007.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expense increased by $1.4 million, or
    7.2%, to $20.4 million in 2008 from $19.0 million in
    2007, primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in personnel
    expenses as we expanded the general and administrative function
    to support the growth of the business, $0.9 million related
    to higher consulting fees and $0.9 million related to the
    increase in bad debt reserves. These increases were offset by an
    increase in gains on foreign currency transactions, which
    increased to $2.8 million in 2008 from $1.2 million in
    2007. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative
    expense decreased to 8.9% in 2008 compared to 10.1% in 2007.

Interest (expense) income, net.

Interest
    (expense) income, net was $0.8 million of net interest
    expense in 2008 compared to $0.7 million of net interest
    income in 2007. Interest expense in 2008 totaled $1.7
    million while interest income was $0.9 million. The change in
    interest (expense) income, net resulted from higher interest
    expense due to increased utilization of credit lines.

(

Provision for) benefit from income taxes.

The
    provision for income taxes increased by $2.6 million to an
    $18.1 million expense in 2008 from a $15.5 million
    expense in 2007. The effective tax rate was 32.0% in 2008 as
    compared to 32.6% in 2007.

Net income.

Net income increased by
    $6.8 million to $36.7 million in 2008 from
    $29.9 million in 2007. Net income as a percentage of our
    net sales increased to 16.0% in 2008 compared to 15.8% in 2007.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net sales.

Net sales increased by
    $45.5 million, or 31.8%, to $188.7 million in 2007
    from $143.2 million in 2006. This increase was attributable
    to higher sales of fiber lasers in materials processing
    applications, where net sales increased by $42.4 million,
    or 43.5%, and advanced applications, where net sales increased
    by $5.8 million, or 30.3%. These increases were partially
    offset by a decrease in sales in communications applications of
    $2.2 million, or 14.2%, and medical applications of
    $0.7 million, or 5.9%. The growth in materials processing
    sales resulted primarily from increased market penetration for
    high-power fiber lasers as well as an increase in sales of
    pulsed and medium-power fiber lasers. The decrease in
    communications



applications sales was due to lower sales of fiber amplifiers to
    our largest U.S. telecom customer due to increased
    competition experienced by our customer as well as completion of
    a project with a customer in Asia. This decrease was partially
    offset by increased sales of telecommunications systems in
    Russia. The slight decrease in sales of medical applications was
    due to lower sales to our largest customer for this application.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of sales
    increased by $23.8 million, or 29.8%, to
    $103.7 million in 2007 from $79.9 million in 2006, as
    a result of increased sales volume. Our gross margin increased
    to 45.0% in 2007 from 44.2% in 2006. The increase in gross
    margin was the result of slightly more favorable absorption of
    our fixed manufacturing costs in 2007 due to higher production
    volumes, which was reduced by higher expenses related to
    continue expansion of our vertically integrated manufacturing
    capacity, higher expenses related to manufacturing salaries and
    benefits, facilities, supplies and tooling and depreciation. A
    higher proportion of high-power sales and a lower proportion of
    amplifier sales in 2007 as compared to 2006 and lower diode
    yields late in 2007. High-power lasers tend to have a lower
    selling price per watt of output and lower contribution margins
    than amplifiers, low-power lasers and pulsed lasers.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $3.9 million, or 62.9%, to
    $10.1 million in 2007 from $6.2 million in 2006,
    primarily as a result of an increase of $1.5 million in
    selling expenses related to an increase in the number of units
    used for demonstration purposes and an increase of
    $1.2 million in personnel costs related to the expansion of
    our worldwide direct sales organization, including our new sales
    and service center in China. The remainder of the increase
    related to increases in costs for trade fairs, travel, premises
    and depreciation. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing
    expense increased to 5.4% in 2007 from 4.4% in 2006. As we
    continue to expand our sales presence and organization worldwide
    we expect expenditures on sales and marketing to continue to
    increase.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $3.0 million, or 46.2%, to
    $9.5 million in 2007 from $6.5 million in 2006. This
    increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million
    in personnel costs and $0.5 million in consulting costs to
    support increased research and development activity. Research
    and development activity continues to focus on enhancing the
    performance of our internally manufactured components, refining
    production processes to improve manufacturing yields and the
    development of new products operating at different wavelengths
    and at higher output powers. As a percentage of sales, research
    and development expense increased to 5.0% in 2007 from 4.6% in
    2006.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expense increased by $4.5 million, or
    31.0%, to $19.0 million in 2007 from $14.5 million in
    2006, primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in
    personnel expenses as we expanded the general and administrative
    function to support the growth of the business and comply with
    the reporting and regulatory requirements of a public company,
    higher stock-compensation costs and increased expenses related
    to our new office in China. General legal, consulting and
    accounting costs increased by $0.6 million due primarily to
    higher audit fees, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance costs and tax
    compliance initiatives. Patent litigation defense fees increased
    by $1.5 million. Insurance costs also increased by
    $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by
    realized and unrealized gains related to foreign currency of
    $1.2 million in 2007 as compared to $0.8 million of
    losses in 2006. As a percentage of sales, general and
    administrative expenses were the same in 2007 and 2006.

Interest income (expense), net.

Interest
    income (expense), net was $0.7 million of net interest
    income in 2007 compared to $1.5 million of net interest
    expense in 2006. The change in interest income (expense), net
    resulted from lower interest expense incurred after the
    repayment of all of our term debt in the first quarter of 2007
    and higher interest income earned on the net proceeds from our
    IPO in December 2006.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

There was no expense related to the
    fair value adjustment of the series B warrants in 2007 as
    compared to $7.4 million in 2006 because we repurchased the
    series B warrants in December 2006. As a result, there will
    be no further charges to record the change in the fair value of
    the series B warrants.

(

Provision for) benefit from income
    taxes.

Provision for income taxes increased by
    $18.5 million to a $15.5 million expense in 2007 from
    a $3.0 million benefit in 2006, representing an effective
    tax rate of 32.6% in 2007 as compared to an effective tax
    benefit of 10.7% in 2006. The increase in the provision for
    income taxes



was primarily due to an increase in earnings before taxes and
    the release in 2006 of our valuation allowance for
    U.S. federal net operating losses. Excluding the release of
    the $13.1 million valuation allowance and the fair value
    adjustment to the series B warrants of $7.4 million,
    the effective tax rate was 28.3% in 2006. The increase in the
    effective tax rate in 2007 is primarily due to an effective tax
    rate applied to

U.S.-generated

income of approximately 35% in 2007 as compared to an effective
    rate of zero percent in 2006. The increase was partially offset
    by a $1.1 million reduction in the carrying value of German
    net deferred tax liabilities due to a change in income tax rates
    in Germany from 38% to approximately 30%. This change in tax
    rates was enacted by the German government during the third
    quarter of 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008.

Net income.

Net income increased by
    $0.7 million to $29.9 million in 2007 from
    $29.2 million in 2006. Net income as a percentage of our
    net sales decreased by 4.6 percentage points to 15.8% in
    2007 from 20.4% in 2006 due to the factors described above and
    in particular the release in 2006 of the valuation allowance for
    U.S federal net operating losses, offset by the charges in 2006
    related to the changes in the fair value of the series B
    warrants.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2008
    consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $51.3 million,
    unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of
    $40.9 million and working capital (excluding cash) of
    $80.7 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents
    of $38.0 million, marketable securities of
    $7.0 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities
    of $39.9 million and working capital (excluding cash) of
    $83.2 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in
    cash and cash equivalents of $13.3 million from
    December 31, 2007 relates primarily to cash provided by
    operating activities in 2008 of $34.7 million, sales of
    marketable securities of $5.5 million and net proceeds from
    our credit lines of $7.8 million, offset by capital
    expenditures and the acquisition of intangible assets totaling
    $37.1 million.

We held approximately $1.3 million in auction-rate
    securities (ARSs) at December 31, 2008, all of which is
    included in other long-term assets, as compared to
    $7.0 million at December 31, 2007, which was included
    in marketable securities. Our investments in ARSs at
    December 31, 2008 consisted solely of taxable municipal
    debt securities. None of the ARSs in our portfolio are
    collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or mortgage-backed
    securities.

As a result of recent auction failures, we continue to hold the
    ARSs not subject to redemption and the issuers are required to
    pay interest on the ARSs at the maximum contractual rate. As
    these auction failures have affected our ability to access these
    funds in the near term, we have classified these as long-term
    available for sale securities. Additionally, we have assessed
    the fair value of these instruments and have identified an
    other-than-temporary decline in their market value related to
    the lack of liquidity. As a result, we carry these ARSs at
    approximately 86% of their face value and recorded a charge
    totaling $191,000 during 2008. These ARSs are insured and are
    rated A2 and AA by Moody’s and Standard &
    Poor’s, respectively. If the credit rating of the issuer of
    the ARSs were to deteriorate, we may be required to further
    adjust the carrying value of these investments by recording
    additional impairment charges. Based on our ability to access
    our cash, our expected operating cash flows and our available
    credit lines, we do not expect that the current lack of
    liquidity in our investments in ARSs will have a material impact
    on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of
    operations.

In June 2008, we refinanced our $20.0 million subordinated
    notes with long-term debt consisting of a $20.0 million
    secured, variable-rate term note described in Note 6 to our
    consolidated financial statements, which matures in July 2013.
    As part of this refinancing, we also increased our existing
    U.S. revolving line of credit from $20.0 million to
    $35.0 million and extended its maturity to July 2011.

We expect that the existing cash and marketable securities, our
    cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit will
    be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital needs for the
    foreseeable future. Our future long-term capital requirements
    will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the
    impact of economic recessions on our sales levels, the timing
    and extent of spending to support development efforts, the
    expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and
    introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to
    adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market
    acceptance of our products. We have made no arrangements to
    obtain additional financing, and there is no assurance that such
    additional financing, if required or desired, will be available
    in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America and
    Deutsche Bank in the amounts of $35 million and
    $21.1 million, respectively, and neither of them is
    syndicated.

The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants
    associated with its U.S. revolving line of credit and long
    term debt facilities. These covenants, tested quarterly, include
    a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings
    before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (“EBITDA”) ratio. The debt service coverage covenant
    requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash
    flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is
    defined as required principal and interest payments during the
    period. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital
    expenditures. For trailing twelve month periods until June 2010,
    up to $15.0 million of our capital expenditures are treated
    as being funded from the proceeds of our initial public
    offering. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the
    sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated
    basis shall be less than two times our trailing twelve months
    EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants
    as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to
    not take or to delay investments and actions that we might
    otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures
    and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do
    not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in
    default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may
    result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt
    or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm
    our results of operations and financial condition.

Operating activities.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities was $34.7 million and
    $10.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by
    operating activities of $24.0 million in 2008 as compared
    to 2007 primarily resulted from:

•

a decrease in prepayments and other current assets of
    $6.8 million in 2008 as compared to an increase of
    $6.8 million in 2007;

•

a decrease in taxes payable of $2.1 million in 2008 as
    compared to a decrease of $11.0 million due to tax
    prepayments in Germany in 2007;

•

an increase in accounts payable of $2.3 million in 2008 as
    compared to a decrease of $1.1 million in 2007;

•

an increase in net income after adding back non-cash charges of
    $5.9 million; partially offset by;

•

cash used to finance inventory of $21.7 million in 2008 as
    compared to cash used of $15.3 million in 2007 primarily
    related to an increase in

work-in-process

and finished goods; and

•

an increase in accounts receivable of $8.5 million in 2008
    as compared to an increase of $11.3 million in 2007.



Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming
    testing procedures for both internally manufactured and
    externally purchased components and the lead time required to
    manufacture components used in our finished product, the rate at
    which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared
    to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required
    investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us
    to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what
    we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was
    a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key
    technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to
    continue to build finished products for a period of time. We
    believe that we will maintain a relatively high level of
    inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we expect
    to have a significant amount of working capital invested in
    inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of
    growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean
    that the rate at which we are able to convert our inventory into
    cash would decrease.

Investing activities.

Net cash used in
    investing activities was $33.7 million and
    $41.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in
    2008 was primarily related to $37.1 million of capital
    expenditures on property, plant and equipment, intangible assets
    and the acquisition of part of the minority interests in one our
    subsidiaries, which was partially offset by $5.5 million of
    proceeds from the sale of marketable securities. The cash used
    in investing activities in 2007 was related to investments in
    marketable securities of $7.0 million and capital
    expenditures on property, plant and equipment of
    $34.3 million, primarily in the United States and Germany.
    In 2008 and 2007, capital expenditures in the United States,
    Germany and Russia related to facilities and equipment for diode
    wafer growth, burn-in test stations and packaging as well as new
    fiber assembly and component production facilities. We expect to
    continue to invest in property, plant and equipment, including
    approximately $15.0 million in 2009. The timing and extent
    of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a
    significant effect on our cash flow.

Financing activities.

Net cash provided by
    financing activities was $12.5 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to net cash used in financing
    activities of $6.8 million in the year ended December 31,
    2007. The cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was
    related to the net proceeds of $7.8 million from the use of
    our credit lines and $5.0 million related to the exercises
    of stock options by employees. Net cash used in financing
    activities in 2007 related to repayment of our long-term bank
    debt, partially offset by the net proceeds from the use of our
    credit lines.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 159”), which provides
    companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements relating to
    the use of fair values within the financial statements. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for the
    Company beginning after January 1, 2008. The Company did
    not designate any financial assets or liabilities to be
    accounted for at fair value, and therefore
    SFAS No. 159 did not have a material impact on
    adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007), Business Combinations
    (“SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007)”), and
    SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51
    (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) requires an acquirer to measure the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on
    the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over
    the net identifiable assets acquired. This standard also
    requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and
    liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies and
    research and development. SFAS No. 141 (revised
    2007) is required to be applied prospectively beginning
    January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
    in a subsidiary should be reported as a component of
    stockholders’ equity in the consolidated financial
    statements. Consolidated net income should include the net
    income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with
    disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of
    income. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to
    be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. SFAS
    No. 160 is effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 160
    will impact the presentation of minority interests on the
    consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
    operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161,

Disclosures
    about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 applies to all
    derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments that are
    designated and qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to
    paragraphs 37 and 42 of SFAS 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
    (“SFAS 133”), and related hedged items accounted
    for under SFAS 133. SFAS 161 requires additional
    disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its
    related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments
    and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial
    position, results of operations, and cash flows. SFAS 161
    is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. The
    Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 161 on the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of
    business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk
    associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt and
    foreign exchange rate risk.

Interest rate risk.

Our investments have
    limited exposure to market risk. To minimize this risk, we
    maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market
    funds and short-term government funds. The interest rates are
    variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because
    of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change
    in market interest rates would not be expected to have a
    material impact on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or
    decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our
    bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. The
    interest rate on our existing bank debt is currently fixed
    except for our U.S. revolving line of credit. The rates on
    our Euro overdraft facilities in Germany and Italy and our
    Japanese Yen overdraft facility are fixed for twelve-month
    periods. Approximately 49% of our outstanding debt had a fixed
    rate of interest as of December 31, 2008. We do not believe
    that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material
    impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Exchange rates.

Due to our international
    operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of
    sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other
    than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro, the Japanese
    Yen and the Russian Ruble. As a result, our international
    operations give rise to transactional market



risk associated with exchange rate movements of the
    U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Russian
    Ruble. Gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions are
    reported as a component of general and administrative expense
    and totaled a $2.8 million gain, and a $1.2 million
    loss and a $0.8 million loss for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Changes in
    exchange rates can also affect our financial results. If
    exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2008 had been
    the same as in the previous year, we estimate that our sales
    would have been lower by approximately $6.8 million.
    Additionally, we estimate that cost of sales and operating
    expenses would have been lower by approximately
    $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Management believes that the use of foreign currency financial
    instruments reduces the risks of certain foreign currency
    transactions, however, these instruments provide only limited
    protection. We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency
    exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging
    techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of
    these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may
    adversely affect our financial results in the future.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our
    Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the
    period covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,
    our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
    concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
    we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f))

for the Company and its subsidiaries. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
    management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation
    Date based on criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of the Evaluation Date, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited our internal
    control over financial reporting, as stated in their report
    below.



Changes
    in Internal Controls

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule

13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer) does not expect that the disclosure controls
    and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all
    control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of
    fraud, if any, within the company have been or will be detected.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, MA

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated
    March 11, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, convertible
    redeemable preferred stock and stockholders’ equity, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IPG
    Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated March 11, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

NATURE OF
    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Nature of Business

— IPG Photonics Corporation
    (the “Company”) designs and manufactures a broad line
    of high-performance fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers for
    diverse applications in numerous markets, such as materials
    processing, advanced applications, communications and medical.
    The Company’s world headquarters are located in Oxford,
    Massachusetts. The Company also has facilities and sales offices
    elsewhere in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Principles of Consolidation

— The Company was
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1998.
    The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

— The financial information
    for entities outside the United States is measured using local
    currencies as the functional currency, except for our Russian
    subsidiary, for which the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the
    respective balance sheet dates. Income and expenses are
    translated into U.S. dollars based on the average rate of
    exchange for the corresponding period. Exchange rate differences
    resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for
    directly as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income except in Russia where translation gains and losses are
    reported in net income. Gains or losses from foreign currency
    transactions are reflected in general and administrative
    expenses in the consolidated statements of income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments, such
    as bank deposits, with insignificant interest rate risk and
    remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of
    acquisition.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable securities
    consist primarily of auction-rate securities. Auction-rate
    securities (ARSs) trade on a shorter term than the maturity date
    of the underlying instrument based on an auction bid that resets
    the interest rate of the security. The auction or reset dates
    occur at intervals of generally less than 90 days. The
    Company classifies these investments as available for sale as
    the securities are not held to the maturity date of the
    underlying instrument and the maturity date of the underlying
    instrument is greater than 3 months. These securities are
    carried at fair value. During 2008, the Company disposed of the
    majority of these securities at par. The auctions for these
    remaining ARSs, with par value of $1.5 million, have failed
    during 2008. The ARSs are classified as other long-term assets
    at December 31, 2008 and are carried at fair value of
    $1.3 million, after recognizing an other-than-temporary
    impairment of $200,000 during 2008.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis. Inventories include parts and components that
    may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence.
    The Company periodically reviews the quantities and carrying
    values of inventories to assess whether the inventories are
    recoverable. Because of the Company’s vertical integration,
    a significant or sudden decrease in sales activity could result
    in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete
    inventory valuation. The costs associated with provisions for
    excess quantities, technological obsolescence, or component
    rejection are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

— Property,
    plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line
    method based on the estimated useful lives of the related
    assets. In the case of leasehold improvements, the estimated
    useful lives of the related assets do

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

not exceed the remaining terms of the corresponding leases. The
    following table presents the assigned economic useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment:

Economic

Category

Useful Life

Buildings

30 years

Machinery and equipment

3-5 years

Office furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Other assets

3-5 years

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations. Interest expense associated with significant capital
    projects is capitalized as a cost of the project. The Company
    capitalized $388,000, $178,000 and $198,000 of interest expense
    in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

— Long-lived assets, which
    consist primarily of property, plant, and equipment, are
    reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. In cases in which undiscounted expected future cash
    flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is
    recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
    the fair value of assets. No impairment losses have been
    recorded during the periods presented.

Included in other long-term assets is certain demonstration
    equipment as well as intangible assets, comprised of purchased
    technologies and customer relationships. The demonstration
    equipment and intangible assets are amortized over the
    respective estimated economic lives, generally 3 years for
    demonstration equipment and 5 years for intangible assets.
    The carrying value of the demonstration equipment totaled $6.8
    million and $6.0 million, at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The recorded cost of the intangibles was
    $7.5 million and $2.5 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The accumulated amortization of the
    intangibles was $2.4 million and $1.8 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Amortization
    expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled
    $0.6 million and the intangible amortization is expected to
    be approximately $1.0 million annually for the next
    4 years.

Revenue Recognition

— The Company recognizes
    revenue in accordance with SEC Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB No. 104”). SAB No. 104
    requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be
    recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and
    (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from the
    sale of the Company’s products is generally recognized upon
    shipment, provided that the other revenue recognition criteria
    have been met. The Company has no obligation to provide
    upgrades, enhancements or customer support subsequent to the
    sale, other than warranty.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. The Company defers revenue on multiple element
    arrangements if the fair values of the undelivered elements are
    not known or if customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of
    specified items or performance conditions and if the performance
    conditions cannot be satisfactorily tested prior to shipment or
    if the Company has not met such conditions in the past.
    Applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied
    separately for each separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. Generally, the Company receives
    a customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and
    product shipment terms are free on board (F.O.B.) shipping
    point. Some of our revenue arrangements include customer
    acceptance clauses. Revenue is deferred until customer
    acceptance has been obtained.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company
    maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the
    estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be
    collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer
    creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of
    outstanding receivables.

Advertising Expense

— The cost of advertising
    is expensed as incurred. The Company conducts substantially all
    of its sales and marketing efforts through trade shows,
    professional and technical conferences, direct sales and use of
    its website. The Company’s advertising costs were not
    significant for the periods presented.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred.

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net
    operating loss carryforwards and credits using enacted rates in
    effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
    allowances are provided against deferred tax assets that are not
    deemed to be recoverable. The Company recognizes tax positions
    that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
    by relevant tax authorities. The tax positions are measured at
    the greatest amount of tax benefit that is more than
    50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to
    various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and
    other issues. Prior to 2007, these reserves were recorded when
    management determined that it was probable that a loss would be
    incurred related to these matters and the amount of the loss was
    reasonably determinable. In 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN No. 48”). As a result, reserves
    recorded subsequent to adoption are based on a determination of
    whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in
    its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be
    realized following resolution of uncertainties related to the
    tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised
    by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties
    associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a
    component of income tax expense.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk
    consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
    securities and accounts receivable. The Company maintains
    substantially all of its cash and marketable securities in four
    financial institutions, which are believed to be high-credit,
    quality financial institutions. The Company grants credit to
    customers in the ordinary course of business and provides a
    reserve for potential credit losses. Such losses historically
    have been within management’s expectations (see discussion
    related to significant customers in Note 14).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    Company’s financial instruments consist of accounts
    receivable, auction rate securities, accounts payable, drawings
    on revolving lines of credit, long-term debt and certain
    derivative instruments. SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements,

(“SFAS No. 157”)
    establishes a fair value hierarchy, which classifies the inputs
    used in measuring fair value. These inputs include:
    Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices
    for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2,
    defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
    that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
    Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or
    no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop
    its own assumptions.

The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable
    and drawings on revolving lines of credit are considered
    reasonable estimates of their fair market value, due to the
    short maturity of these instruments or as a result of the
    competitive market interest rates, which have been negotiated.
    Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for
    bank loans with similar terms and average maturities as the
    Company’s long-term debt, the fair value of long-term debt
    was $18.5 million at December 31, 2008. In 2007, the

The interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and
    was based on quoted market prices or pricing models using
    current market rates. Fair value at December 31, 2008 for
    the auction rate securities was determined using an analysis of
    discounted cash. In 2007, the ARSs were included in marketable
    securities and their carrying value was the same as their quoted
    fair value.

Derivative Instruments

— Derivative instruments
    are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance
    sheet and are measured at fair value with gains or losses
    recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending
    on the nature of the derivative. The Company determines the fair
    value of derivative instruments based on available market data
    using appropriate valuation models, giving consideration to all
    of the rights and obligations of each instrument.

Derivative instruments are not held for speculative purposes,
    but are generally acquired to provide protection against adverse
    changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities or adverse
    changes in expected cash flows. The Company has an established
    risk management policy, and appropriate documentation of hedging
    relationships is put in place prior to designating an instrument
    as an accounting hedge. At December 31, 2008, the only
    derivative instrument held by the Company consists of an
    interest rate swap, designated as a hedge of interest payments
    expected to be incurred associated with the Company’s
    U.S. Long-Term Note payable through 2013 (which bear
    interest at a variable rate). The swap is assessed for
    effectiveness each quarter, and to date has been highly
    effective at offsetting changes in interest payments due to
    changes in interest rates and is expected to continue to be so
    through the maturity of the swap.

Beneficial Conversion

— When the Company issues
    debt or equity that is convertible into common stock at a
    discount from the common stock fair value at the date the debt
    or equity is issued, a beneficial conversion feature for the
    difference between the fair value and the conversion price
    multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion is
    recorded as a beneficial conversion charge or deemed dividend.
    The beneficial

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

conversion feature is presented as a discount to the related
    debt or a deemed dividend to the related equity holders, with an
    offsetting amount increasing additional paid-in capital.

Business Segment Information

— The Company
    operates in one segment which involves the design, development,
    production and distribution of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers
    and related optical components. The Company has a single,
    company-wide management team that administers all properties as
    a whole rather than as discrete operating segments. The chief
    decision maker, who is the company’s Chief Executive
    Officer, measures financial performance as a single enterprise
    and not on legal entity or end-market basis. Throughout the
    year, the chief decision maker allocates capital resources on a

project-by-project

basis across the Company’s entire asset base to maximize
    profitability without regard to legal entity or end-market
    basis. The Company operates in a number of countries throughout
    the world in a variety of product lines. Information regarding
    geographic financial information and product lines is provided
    in Note 14.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

—  In February
    2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 159”), which provides
    companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements relating to
    the use of fair values within the financial statements. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 were effective for the
    Company beginning after January 1, 2008. The Company did
    not designate any financial assets or liabilities to be
    accounted for at fair value, and therefore
    SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007)”), and
    SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
    Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) requires an acquirer to measure the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on
    the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over
    the net identifiable assets acquired. This standard also
    requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and
    liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies and
    research and development. SFAS No. 141 (revised
    2007) is required to be applied prospectively beginning
    January 1, 2009.

SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest
    in a subsidiary should be reported as a component of
    stockholders’ equity in the consolidated financial
    statements. Consolidated net income should include the net
    income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest with
    disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of
    income. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to
    be based on income amounts attributable to the parent.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 160
    will impact the presentation of minority interests on the
    consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
    operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS 161,

Disclosures
    about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 applies to all
    derivative instruments and

non-derivative

instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging
    instruments pursuant to paragraphs 37 and 42 of SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

, (“SFAS 133”), and related hedged
    items accounted for under SFAS 133.  SFAS 161 requires
    additional disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses
    derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and
    its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
    SFAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2009.  The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact of adopting SFAS 161 on the consolidated financial
    statements.

Compensation cost for all share-based payment awards is based on
    the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”).
    The Company allocates and records stock-based compensation
    expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period.

Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company calculates the fair
    value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. Determining the appropriate fair value
    model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment
    awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions,
    including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards
    and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating
    the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent
    management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve
    inherent uncertainties and the application of management
    judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses
    different assumptions, the Company’s stock-based
    compensation expense could be materially different in the
    future. The weighted average assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model were as follows for the years ended December
    31:

The weighted average expected option term for awards granted in
    2007 and 2006 reflects the application of the simplified method
    set forth in Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
    Bulletin, or SAB, No. 107. The simplified method defines
    the life as the average of the contractual term of the options
    and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches.
    Commencing in 2008, the Company began to use historic exercise
    activities of its own stock options as well as projections based
    on historic experience.

Because the Company’s common stock has been publicly traded
    since December 2006, there is a lack of sufficient
    company-specific historical and implied volatility information.
    The Company based its estimate of expected volatility on the
    expected volatility of similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available. The Company used the following factors to
    identify similar public entities: industry, stage of life cycle,
    size and profitability. The Company intends to continue to
    consistently apply this process using the same or similar
    entities until a sufficient amount of historical information
    regarding the volatility of its own share price becomes
    available, or unless circumstances change such that the
    identified entities are no longer similar to the

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company. In this latter case, more suitable, similar entities
    whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in
    the calculation.

Incentive Plans

— In April 2000, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the 2000 Incentive
    Compensation Plan, or 2000 plan, and in February 2006, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the 2006 Incentive
    Compensation Plan, or 2006 plan, which provide for the issuance
    of stock options and other stock and non-stock based awards to
    the Company’s directors, employees, consultants and
    advisors. The Company reserved 5,833,333 shares under the
    2000 plan and 4,000,000 shares under the 2006 plan for the
    issuance of awards under the plans. In June 2006, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the Non-Employee
    Directors Stock Plan (the “Directors Plan”). Only
    non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the
    Directors Plan. The Company reserved 166,666 shares for
    issuance under the Directors Plan. Under the three plans, the
    Company may grant nonstatutory stock options at an exercise
    price at least equal to the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant, unless the
    board of directors or compensation committee determines
    otherwise on the date of grant. Incentive stock options may be
    granted under the 2000 plan and the 2006 plan at exercise prices
    equal to or exceeding the fair market value of the common stock
    on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over
    periods of one to five years and expire seven to ten years from
    the date of the grant. The awards under the 2000 plan and the
    2006 plan may become exercisable earlier upon the occurrence of
    certain change of control events at the election of the board of
    directors or compensation committee, and all awards under the
    Directors Plan automatically become exercisable upon a change of
    control. All shares issued under the stock option plans are
    registered shares newly issued by the Company. At
    December 31, 2008, 2,475,315 shares were available for
    future grant under the three option plans.

U.S. Line of Credit

— The Company
    maintains an unsecured revolving line of credit with available
    principal of up to $35,000,000 expiring in July 2011. The line
    of credit bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 0.8%
    to 1.2% depending on the Company’s financial performance
    (4.2% at December 31, 2008). The line of credit also allows
    for draw downs by certain subsidiaries. At December 31,
    2008, the remaining availability under the U.S. Line of
    Credit totaled $15,900,000 at December 31, 2008.

Euro Line of Credit —

In October 2007, the
    Company entered into a new unsecured revolving line of credit
    with a principal amount of Euro 15,000,000 (approximately
    $21,142,000 at December 31, 2008). The credit facility
    bears interest at various rates based upon the type of loan and
    matures in June 2010. No amounts were drawn on the Euro Line of
    Credit during 2008 and 2007.

Euro Overdraft Facilities

— The Company
    maintains a syndicated overdraft facility with available
    principal of Euro 1,873,000 (approximately $2,639,000 at
    December 31, 2008). This amount is available through
    September 2009. This facility bears interest at market rates
    that vary depending upon the bank within the syndicate that
    advances the principal outstanding (6.95% at December 31,
    2008). This facility is collateralized by a common pool of the
    assets of the Company’s German subsidiary, IPG Laser GmbH.

Other European Facilities

— The Company
    maintains two Euro credit lines in Italy with aggregate
    available principal of Euro 1,300,000 (approximately
    $1,878,000 as of December 31, 2008) which bear
    interest at rates ranging from 5.65% to 6.75%. At
    December 31, 2008, the aggregate remaining availability
    under the Euro credit lines was $1,208,000. These facilities are
    collateralized by a common pool of the assets of the
    Company’s Italian subsidiary, IPG Photonics (Italy) S.r.l.
    (“IPG Italy”). One of these facilities requires annual
    renewal, while the other does not have a maturity date.

Term
    Debt:

U.S. Long-Term Note

— In 2008, the Company
    refinanced its subordinated notes with a U.S Long-Term Note.
    Outstanding principal under the U.S. Long-Term Note bears
    interest at LIBOR plus 0.8% to 1.2%, depending on certain
    financial ratios and requires monthly principal payments of
    $111,000 and interest through August 2013, at which time the
    remaining principal is payable. This note is collateralized by a

mortgage on the real estate and building, in Massachusetts,
    housing the Company’s U.S. operations. The Company
    entered into an interest rate swap instrument which converts the
    variable LIBOR rate on the term note to a fixed rate of 4.9%.
    The interest rate swap has been designated a cash flow hedge
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting
    for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. The fair
    value of the swap totaled $(1.7) million at
    December 31, 2008 and is included in “Deferred Income
    Taxes and Other Long-Term Liabilities” in the consolidated
    balance sheet. Changes in fair value of the swap are included in
    “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”. The
    unrealized loss on the swap will be recognized into income over
    the term of the swap as a charge to interest expense.

Subordinated Notes

— The Company issued
    subordinated notes to the holders of its Series B
    convertible redeemable preferred stock upon conversion of their
    shares in December 2006. The subordinated notes bore interest at
    4.97% in the first year and 7% in the second year. In August
    2008, the Company repaid the subordinated notes with the
    proceeds from the U.S. Long-Term Note.

The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants
    associated with its U.S. Line of Credit and U.S. Long-Term Note.
    These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service
    coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio.
    The debt service coverage covenant requires the Company to
    maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt
    service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as
    required principal and interest payments during the period. Cash
    flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures.
    For trailing twelve month periods until June 2010, up to
    $15.0 million of our capital expenditures are treated as
    being funded from the proceeds of our initial public offering.
    The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all
    indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis shall be
    less than two times our trailing twelve months EBITDA.

PREFERRED
    STOCK, STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND MINORITY
    INTERESTS

Authorized Capital

—  The Company has
    authorized capital stock consisting of 175,000,000 shares
    of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and
    5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per
    share. There are currently no shares of preferred stock
    outstanding.

Initial Public Offering

— The Company received
    proceeds of $93.2 million, net of expenses, from its
    issuance and sale of 6,241,379 shares of common stock in
    December 2006.

Preferred Stock

— Upon the Company’s
    initial public offering in December 2006, 488,000 outstanding
    shares of Series A convertible preferred stock (the
    “Series A”) converted into 359,463 shares of
    common stock, 3,800,000 outstanding shares of Series B
    convertible redeemable preferred stock (the
    “Series B”) converted into 7,252,927 shares
    of common stock and $20.0 million principal amount of
    subordinated promissory notes, and 2,684,211 outstanding shares
    of Series D convertible redeemable preferred stock
    converted into 1,683,168 shares of common stock.

Because of the anti-dilution provision in the Series A and
    Series B, as a result of the initial public offering, the
    Company recorded a deemed dividend related to the beneficial
    conversion of the Series A and Series B of $63,000 and
    $18,204,000, respectively. The deemed dividend was recorded to
    give effect to the additional shares issued to the holders of
    Series A and Series B.

Warrants

— In connection with the issuance of
    the Series B in 2000, the Company issued Series B
    Warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, $47,500,000 of the
    Company’s common stock at an equivalent per-share price of
    50% of the fair value on the date of an initial public offering
    of common stock or the sale, merger or liquidation of the
    Company. The Company repurchased all of the Series B
    Warrants in connection with its initial public offering in
    December 2006 for $22,087,000. As freestanding derivative
    instruments, changes in fair value of the Series B Warrants
    were recognized in earnings and reported as other income
    (expense). For the year ended December 31, 2006 the fair

RELATED-PARTY
    TRANSACTIONS

Through July 2006, IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd.
    (“IPFD”), an entity that is controlled by the
    Company’s chief executive officer, two management directors
    and certain other members of management, provided the Company
    with a revolving credit facility. Interest expense on the IPFD
    credit facility totaled $94,000 during 2006. In July 2006, IPFD
    purchased from the Company’s chief executive officer
    770,670 shares of the Company’s common stock in
    exchange for $357,000 in cash and $4.6 million in the form
    of the assignment of the amounts due under the IPFD credit
    facility. Simultaneously, the Company exchanged with the chief
    executive officer the note due from him with a remaining
    principal amount of $5.0 million for $357,000 in cash and
    $4.6 million in the form of the assignment of amounts due
    under the IPFD credit facility. Consequently, the IPFD credit
    facility and the note receivable from the chief executive
    officer were fully repaid and were no longer outstanding at
    December 31, 2006.

From November 2004 to August 2006, the Company’s chief
    executive officer provided a personal guarantee for a
    U.S. credit facility that has since been repaid. In
    consideration of the personal guarantee, the Company paid him a
    guarantee fee equal to the interest on his loan from the Company
    (with a tax

gross-up)

while the credit facility was outstanding. The guarantee fee was
    $71,000 in 2006.

The Company leases office space from IPFD and reimburses IPFD
    for general and administrative expenses. The costs related to
    the lease and services totaled $183,000, $116,000 and $115,000
    for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In April 2006, a director of one of the Company’s
    then-existing customers joined the Company’s board of
    directors. Sales to this customer totaled $2,351,000,
    $10,296,000 and $10,366,000 for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company paid $295,000, $252,000 and $181,000 to the father
    of the Company’s chief financial officer in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The amounts included payments for consulting
    services, commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

During 2008, the Company repaid its subordinated notes as
    described in Note 6. A member of the Company’s board
    of directors is affiliated with several holders of the
    subordinated notes, which received $10.3 million in
    principal in conjunction with the repayment of the subordinated
    notes. These holders earned $320,000, $540,000 and $20,000 of
    interest in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

NET
    INCOME PER SHARE

For periods during which the Company had two classes of equity
    securities issued and outstanding, the Company followed EITF
    Issue

No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the Two —
    Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128

(“EITF 03-6”),

which established standards regarding the computation of net
    income per share by companies that have issued securities other
    than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to
    participate in dividends and earnings of the company.

EITF 03-6

requires earnings available to common stockholders for the
    period, after deduction of preferred stock accretion and deemed
    dividends related to beneficial conversion features, to be
    allocated between the common and convertible securities based on
    their

respective rights to receive dividends. Basic net income per
    share is then calculated by dividing income applicable to common
    stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares
    outstanding. The Company’s preferred stock does not
    participate in losses, and therefore is not included in the
    computation of net loss per share, as applicable.

EITF 03-6

does not require the presentation of basic and diluted net
    income per share for securities other than common stock;
    therefore, the following per share amounts only pertain to the
    Company’s common stock.

The Company calculates diluted net income per share under the
    if-converted method unless the conversion of the convertible
    preferred stock is dilutive to basic net income per share. To
    the extent convertible preferred stock is dilutive, the Company
    calculates diluted net income per share under the two-class
    method to include the effect of potential common shares.

The share count used to compute basic and diluted net income per
    share is calculated as follows (in thousands):

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

In November 2006, the Company was sued for patent infringement
    relating to fiber laser and amplifier products we produce. The
    plaintiff has made a complaint for damages of over
    $10 million, treble damages for alleged willful
    infringement and injunctive relief. The case has been stayed
    until the termination of a pending patent re-examination.

In February 2008, the Company was sued for patent infringement
    relating to two product lines used in medical laser
    applications. The plaintiff has filed a complaint for
    unspecified damages, treble damages for alleged willful
    infringement and injunctive relief. The patent asserted in the
    lawsuit expired in April 2007. The case has been stayed until
    October 2009 in connection with a pending patent re-examination.

The Company believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to
    vigorously contest these claims. No loss is deemed probable at

In 2006, the Company determined that it was more likely than not

    assets and released $13,060,000 related to the valuation
    allowance in addition to a favorable change of $4,620,000
    resulting from the use of net operating losses in 2006. In 2007,
    the provision for income taxes was affected by a change in
    valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of
    a reduction in enacted tax rates in Germany. Additionally, there
    was a change in certain U.S. deferred tax assets and
    liabilities as a result of a change in estimated state tax rates
    and a change in valuation allowance due to the utilization of
    state tax loss carry-forwards. In 2008, the provision for income
    taxes was affected by a change in valuation of deferred tax
    assets and liabilities as a result of a reduction in enacted tax
    rates in Russia as well as a release of valuation allowance due
    to the utilization of the remaining state tax loss
    carry-forwards.
