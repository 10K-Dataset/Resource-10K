Industry
    Background

Traditional
    Laser Technologies

Since the laser was invented over 45 years ago, laser
    technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and
    products in various industries, including automotive, medical,
    research, consumer products, electronics, semiconductors and
    communications. Lasers provide flexible, non-contact and
    high-speed ways to process and treat various materials. They are
    widely used to transmit large volumes of data in optical
    communications systems, in various medical applications and in
    test and measurement systems. For a wide variety of
    applications, lasers provide superior performance and a more
    cost-effective solution than non-laser technologies.

Lasers emit an intense light beam that can be focused on a small
    area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or
    change their character. These properties are utilized in
    applications requiring very high-power densities, such as
    marking, printing, welding, cutting and other materials
    processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and
    inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light
    to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in
    medical and sensing applications. A laser works by converting
    electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy
    source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the
    energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles
    of light, called photons, at a particular wavelength. Lasers are
    used as an energy or light source for various applications. They
    are also incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other
    systems by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”),
    system integrators and end users.

Historically,
    CO


gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser
    types used in materials processing and many other applications.
    They are named for the materials used to create the lasing
    action. A
    CO


laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled
    tube. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp, or
    diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The
    most common crystal lasers use YAG crystals infused with
    neodymium or ytterbium. Despite the improvements in
    CO


and YAG laser technologies over the past 40 years, these
    technologies have not kept pace with evolving customer
    requirements.

Introduction
    of Fiber Lasers

Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to
    pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth
    ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable
    in diameter to a human hair. The laser emission is created
    within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible cable. As
    a result of their different design and components, fiber lasers
    are generally more reliable, efficient, robust and portable, and
    easier to operate than traditional lasers.

Although low-power fiber lasers have existed for approximately
    four decades, their increased recent adoption has been driven
    primarily by our improvements in their performance, increases in
    output power levels and decreased costs. Over the last several
    years, technological improvements in optical components such as
    active fibers have increased their power capacities and resulted
    in overall performance improvements in fiber lasers. Also, the
    high cost of semiconductor diodes, a critical component of fiber
    lasers, meant that fiber lasers could not compete with
    conventional lasers on price and limited their use to high
    value-added applications. Over the last decade, however,
    semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and reliable
    due in part to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode
    technology and increased production volumes. Because of these
    improvements, fiber lasers can now effectively compete with
    conventional lasers over a wide range of output powers and
    applications.



Advantages
    of Fiber Lasers over Traditional Lasers

We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits
    that include:

•

Superior Performance.

Fiber lasers provide
    high beam quality over the entire power range. The superior beam
    quality and greater intensity of a fiber laser’s beam allow
    tasks to be accomplished rapidly and with lower-power units than
    comparable traditional lasers.

•

Lower Total Cost of Ownership.

Fiber lasers
    offer strong value to customers because of their generally lower
    total operating costs due to their lower required maintenance
    costs, high reliability and energy efficiency. The initial
    purchase price for fiber lasers is generally below that of YAG
    lasers and comparable to that of
    CO


lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and
    place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal
    components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements
    compared to conventional lasers and lower or no required
    maintenance costs.

•

Ease of Use.

Many features of fiber lasers
    make them easy to operate, maintain and integrate into
    laser-based systems, providing a turnkey solution.

•

Compact Size and Portability.

Fiber lasers are
    typically smaller and lighter in weight than traditional lasers,
    saving valuable floor space. Fiber lasers are durable and able
    to perform in variable working environments, qualities that
    permit fiber laser systems to be transported easily and perform
    in variable working environments.

•

Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of
    Beam.

The design of fiber lasers generally
    provides a broad range of wavelength choices, a highly stable
    output and improved control of output beam parameters, allowing
    users to more effectively use lasers in their applications.

Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many
    of the same components, such as semiconductor diodes and
    specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same
    advantages in the applications that require amplification.

Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there
    remain applications and processes where traditional laser
    technologies and non-laser tools may provide superior
    performance with respect to particular features. For example,
    crystal lasers can provide higher peak power pulses and fiber
    lasers do not generate the deep ultraviolet light that is used
    for photolithography in many semiconductor applications.

Our
    Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key strengths and competitive advantages
    include the following:

Differentiated Proprietary Technology
    Platform.

At the core of our products is our
    proprietary pumping technology platform that allows our products
    to have higher output powers and superior beam quality than are
    achievable through traditional techniques. It allows us to
    combine a greater number of diodes, specialty optical fibers and
    optoelectronic components in parallel into a single beam using
    our advanced proprietary components and

state-of-the-art

combining techniques.

    technology leader in fiber lasers, we have built leading
    positions in our various end markets with a large and diverse
    customer base. Based on our leadership position, we are driving
    the proliferation of fiber lasers in existing and new
    applications.

Breadth and Depth of Expertise.

Since the
    founding of our company in 1990, our core business has been
    developing, designing, manufacturing and marketing advanced
    fiber lasers and amplifiers. We have extensive know-how in
    materials sciences, and optical, electrical, mechanical and
    semiconductor engineering that enables us to make our specialty
    optical fibers, semiconductor diodes and other critical
    components.



Vertically Integrated Development and
    Manufacturing.

We develop and manufacture all of
    our key specialty components, such as semiconductor diodes,
    active fibers, passive fibers and specialty optical components.
    Our proprietary components, which we do not resell, are capable
    of handling the stress of the high optical powers from our
    products and we believe they exceed the performance of
    commercially available components. We believe that our vertical
    integration enhances our ability to meet customer requirements,
    accelerate development, manage costs and improve component
    yields, while maintaining high performance and quality standards.

Diverse Customer Base, End Markets and
    Applications.

Our diverse customer base, end
    markets and applications provide us with many growth
    opportunities. We have shipped more than 24,000 units
    through the end of 2006 and, in 2006, we shipped to more than
    500 customers worldwide. Our products are used in a variety of
    applications and end markets worldwide. Our principal end
    markets and representative applications within those markets
    include:

Leverage Our Technology to Gain Market
    Share.

As the benefits of fiber lasers become
    more widely recognized, we plan to leverage our brand and
    position as the leader in developing and commercializing fiber
    lasers to increase our market share in the broader market.

Target New Applications for Lasers.

We intend
    to continue to enable and penetrate additional applications
    where lasers have not traditionally been used. We believe that
    fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that
    have slowed the adoption of traditional lasers. We intend to
    target applications where higher power, portability, efficiency,
    size and flexible fiber cable delivery can lead customers to
    adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions.

Expand Our Product Portfolio.

We plan to
    continue to invest in research and development to add additional
    wavelengths, power levels and other parameters while also
    improving beam quality. We intend to use our core technologies
    to develop new products and complementary products and systems
    that incorporate fiber lasers and amplifiers to expand our
    product portfolio.

Optimize Our Manufacturing Capabilities.

We
    plan to seek further increases in the automation of our
    component manufacturing processes and device assembly to improve
    component yields and increase the power outputs and capacities
    of the various components that we make. We intend to leverage
    our technology and operations expertise to manufacture
    additional components in order to reduce costs, ensure component
    quality and ensure supply.

Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers
    Worldwide.

In 2006, more than 67% of our sales
    came from international customers. We intend to capitalize on
    and grow our global customer base by opening new application
    development centers as well as sales and service offices in
    Asia, Europe and the United States.

Products

We design and manufacture a broad range of high-performance
    optical fiber-based lasers and amplifiers. We also make direct
    diode laser systems and communications systems that utilize our
    optical fiber-based products. Many of our products are designed
    to be used as general purpose energy or light sources, making
    them useful in diverse applications and markets.

Our products are based on a common proprietary technology
    platform using many of the same core components which we
    configure to our customers’ specifications. Our engineers
    and scientists work closely with OEMs and end users to develop
    and customize our products for their needs. Because of our
    flexible and modular product architecture, we offer products in
    different configurations according to the desired applications.
    The Company’s engineers and other technical experts work
    directly with the customer in the Company’s applications
    centers to develop and configure the optimal solution for each
    customer’s manufacturing requirements.

Lasers

Our laser products include low (1 to 99 watts), medium (100 to
    999 watts) and high (1,000 watts and above) output power lasers
    from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. These lasers may be either
    continuous wave or modulated at different rates. We offer
    several different types of lasers, which are defined by the type
    of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium, thulium
    and raman. We also sell fiber coupled direct diode



laser systems that use semiconductor diodes rather than optical
    fibers as their gain medium. In addition, we offer high energy
    pulsed lasers, multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers,
    single-polarization and single-frequency lasers, as well as
    other versions of our products.

We believe that we produce some of the highest power solid-state
    lasers available. Our ytterbium fiber lasers are capable of
    reaching power levels over 50,000 watts. We also make
    single-mode output ytterbium fiber lasers with powers of up to
    2,000 watts and single-mode output erbium and thulium fiber
    lasers with powers of up to 200 watts. Our compact, durable
    design and integrated fiber optic beam delivery allows us to
    offer versatile laser energy sources and simple laser
    integration for complex production processes, without
    compromising quality, speed or power.

Amplifiers

Our amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to 500 watts
    of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We offer
    erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, commonly called EDFAs, raman
    amplifiers and integrated communications systems that
    incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly
    deployed in broadband networks and dense wavelength division
    multiplexing, or DWDM, networks. We also offer ytterbium and
    thulium specialty fiber amplifiers and broadband light sources
    that are used in advanced applications. In addition, we sell
    single-frequency, linearly polarized and
    polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier products. As
    with our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer some of the
    highest output power levels and highest number of optical
    outputs. We believe our line of fiber amplifiers offers the best
    commercially available output power and performance.



The following summarizes some of our product offerings by
    product family, primary markets and representative applications
    for each product family:



Materials
    Processing

The most significant materials processing applications for fiber
    lasers are marking, printing, welding and cutting. Other
    applications include micromachining, surface treatment,
    drilling, soldering, annealing, rapid prototyping and
    laser-assisted machining.

Marking, Engraving and Printing
    Applications.

With the increasing need for source
    traceability, component identification and product tracking as a
    means of reducing product liability and preventing
    falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic
    production systems, industrial manufacturers are increasingly
    demanding marking systems capable of applying serialized
    alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto
    their manufactured components. Laser engraving is similar to
    marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to
    conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can
    mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as
    ceramic, glass and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without
    contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by
    engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a
    customer’s production process and do not subject the item
    being marked to mechanical stress.

In the semiconductor industry, lasers are typically used to mark
    wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry,
    lasers are typically used to mark electrical components such as
    contactors and relays, printed circuit boards and keyboards.
    With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the
    cost of laser marking has decreased, improving the price and
    performance characteristics of this technology. The high beam
    quality, flexible fiber delivery and competitive price of fiber
    lasers have accelerated the adoption of fiber lasers in this
    low-power application.

Historically, the printing industry has depended upon
    silver-halide films and chemicals to engrave printing plates.
    This chemical engraving process requires several time-consuming
    steps. In recent years, we have worked closely with OEMs in the
    printing industry to employ fiber lasers for alternative

“computer-to-plate,”

or CTP, processes. As a result, our ytterbium fiber lasers are
    now widely used for CTP printing, an environmentally friendly
    process that saves production time by writing directly to plates
    and greatly reduces chemical waste.

Welding Applications.

Laser welding offers
    several important advantages over conventional welding
    technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate, provides high
    process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high quality welds
    that generally require little or no post- processing machining.
    Parts can be accurately machined before welding because laser
    welding does not overly heat or otherwise damage or distort the
    material being processed. The high beam quality of our fiber
    lasers coupled with high CW power offers deep penetration
    welding as well as shallow conduction mode welding. High
    modulation frequencies offer very high throughput in pulsed
    applications. Also, fiber lasers can be focused to a small spot
    with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote welding
    “on the fly,” a flexible method of three-dimensional
    welding in which the laser beam is positioned by a robot-guided
    scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped with fiber lasers
    are used for welding door panels and the multiple welding of
    spot and lap welds over the entire auto body frame. Typically,
    mid to high-power ytterbium fiber lasers are used in welding
    applications.

Cutting Applications.

Laser-based cutting
    technology has several advantages compared to alternative
    technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible, highly precise
    and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or
    three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be easily
    programmed to process many different kinds of materials such as
    steel, aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at
    various thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact
    process that is easy to integrate into an automated production
    line and is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell
    low, mid and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser
    cutting. The operating wavelength, multi-kilowatt power, high
    beam quality, wide operating power range, power stability and
    small spot size are some of the qualities offered by fiber
    lasers for most cutting applications.

Emerging Technologies and
    Applications.

Robotic production methods are
    increasing in use, driven by their lower production costs,
    flexibility and consistency. Fiber lasers complement the
    capabilities of robots with their flexible fiber delivery,
    high-power beam and low beam divergence. Another potential
    application of



fiber lasers is in cutting new lightweight and high-strength
    metal alloys used in automobile manufacturing, which requires
    the high output power densities that fiber lasers provide.

Communications

We design and manufacture a full range of fiber amplifiers and
    raman pump lasers with varying output power and wavelengths that
    enhance data transmission in broadband access and DWDM optical
    networks.

Broadband Access.

The delivery to subscribers
    of television programming and Internet-based information and
    communication services is converging, driven by advances in IP
    technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive
    environment. Fiber optic lines offer connection speeds of up to
    50 megabits per second, or 50 times faster than digital
    subscriber lines (DSL) or cable links. We offer a series of
    specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable TV nodes and transmitters
    that support different types of passive optical network
    architectures, enabling high speed data, voice, video on demand
    and high definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to
    32 ports, which allows service providers to support a high
    number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power
    consumption and network cost. End users for our products include
    communications network operators for video wavelength division
    multiplexing overlay, as well as cable and multiple service
    operators for video signal and hybrid fiber coaxial cable.

DWDM.

DWDM is a technology that expands the
    capacity of optical networks allowing service providers to
    extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating
    and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a
    broad range of high-power products for DWDM applications
    including EDFAs and raman lasers. We provide a DWDM transport
    system that offers service providers and private network
    operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution optimized
    for up to eight channels.

Medical

We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that
    incorporate our products into their medical laser systems.
    Continuous wave and pulsed lasers from 1 to 150 watts and diode
    laser systems can be used in medical and biomedical
    applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include
    skin rejuvenation, skin resurfacing and stretch mark removal.
    Purchasers use our diode lasers in urological applications and
    dental procedures. Fiber lasers have the ability to fine-tune
    optical penetration depth and absorption characteristics and can
    be used for ear, nose and throat, urology, gynecology and other
    surgical procedures.

Advanced
    Applications

Our fiber lasers and amplifiers are utilized by commercial firms
    and by academic and government institutions worldwide for
    manufacturing of commercial systems and for research in advanced
    technologies and products. These markets may use specialty
    products developed by us or commercial versions of our products.

Obstacle Warning.

Our products are used aboard
    aircraft for obstacle warning and

3-dimensional

mapping of earth surfaces.

Special Projects.

Due to the high power,
    compactness, performance, portability, ruggedness and electrical
    efficiency of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, we sell our
    commercial products for government research and projects. These
    include materials testing, ordnance destruction, coherent beam
    combining, advanced communications and research.

Research and Development.

Our products are
    used in a variety of applications for research and development
    by scientists and industrial researchers. In addition, our
    lasers and amplifiers are used to design, test and characterize
    components and systems in a variety of markets and applications.

Optical Pumping and Harmonic
    Generation.

Several types of our lasers are used
    to optically pump other solid-state lasers and for harmonic
    generation and parametric converters to support research in
    sensing, medical and other scientific research in the infrared
    and visible wavelength domains. Our lasers are used as a power
    source for these other lasers.



Optical Communication.

We provide high-power
    EDFAs and ytterbium fiber amplifiers for deployment in both

point-to-point

and

point-to-multipoint

free space optical networks. These networks permit
    communications between two or more points on land or in the sky
    without the use of fiber optic lines or radio or microwaves.

Remote Sensing.

Our products are used in light
    detection and ranging, also called LIDAR, a laser technique for
    remote sensing. Optical fiber can be used as a sensor for
    measuring changes in temperature, pressure and gas concentration
    in oil wells, atmospheric and pollution measurements and seismic
    exploration.

Technology

Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform.
    The following technologies are key elements in our products.

Specialty
    Optical Fibers

We have expertise in the disciplines and techniques that form
    the basis for the multi-clad active and passive optical fibers
    used in our products. Active optical fibers form the laser
    cavity or gain medium in which lasing or amplification of light
    occurs in our products. Passive optical fibers deliver the
    optical energy created in our products. Our active fibers
    consist of an inner core that is infused with the appropriate
    rare earth ion, such as ytterbium, erbium or thulium, and outer
    cores of un-doped glass having different indices of refraction.
    Our ability to quickly optimize our proprietary active and
    passive optical fibers allow us to provide a variety of
    innovative fiber devices in customizable configurations.

Semiconductor
    Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies

Another key element of our technology platform is that we use
    multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather
    than diode bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that
    multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and
    reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode
    bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability.

We developed molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow wafers
    for our diodes. This method yields high-quality optoelectronic
    material for low-defect density and high uniformity of
    optoelectronic parameters. In addition, we have developed
    proprietary wafer processes and testing and qualification
    procedures in order to create a high energy output in a reliable
    and high-power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically
    sealed pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an
    optical fiber output.

Specialty
    Components and Combining Techniques

We have developed optical components that are capable of
    handling high optical power levels and contribute to the
    superior performance, efficiency, reliability and uniqueness of
    our products. In addition to fibers and diodes, our optical
    component portfolio includes fiber gratings, isolators and
    combiners. We also developed methods and expertise in splicing
    fibers together with low optical energy loss and on-line loss
    testing.

Side
    Pumping of Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a
    greater number of multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes
    with our active optical fibers that are used in all of our
    products. A key element of this technology is that we pump our
    fiber lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core.
    Our design is scalable and modular, permitting us to make
    products with high output power by coupling a large number of
    diodes with fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and
    serially.



High-Stress
    Testing

We employ high-stress techniques in testing components and final
    products that help increase reliability and accelerate product
    development. We also have built a large database of diode test
    results that allows us to predict the estimated lifetime of our
    diodes and thus increase reliability.

Customers

We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and
    end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the
    in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into
    their own systems. In 2006, we shipped products to over 500
    customers worldwide. Our end markets include materials
    processing (comprised of general manufacturing, automotive,
    aerospace, heavy industry, semiconductor, electronics and
    consumer products customers), communications (comprised of
    system integrators, utilities and municipalities), medical
    (medical laser systems manufacturers) and advanced applications
    (comprised of commercial companies, universities, research
    entities and government entities). We believe that our customer
    and end market diversification minimizes dependence on any
    single industry or group of customers.

Backlog

At December 31, 2006, our backlog of orders scheduled for
    shipment (generally within one year) was approximately
    $51.8 million compared to $39.0 million at
    December 31, 2005. Orders used to compute backlog are
    generally cancelable without substantial penalties.
    Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by us has not
    been significant. We manage the risk of cancellation by
    establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that
    generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials
    and development costs incurred prior to the order being
    cancelled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many
    factors including, but not limited to, the customer’s
    requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding
    orders with the customer and our ability to quickly convert the
    canceled order to another sale.

The Company anticipates shipping the present backlog during
    fiscal year 2007. However, the Company’s backlog at any
    given date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any
    future period.



Sales,
    Marketing and Support

We market our products internationally primarily through our
    direct sales force and also through agreements with independent
    sales representatives and distributors. We have sales offices in
    the United States, Germany, Russia, Italy, Japan, South Korea,
    India and the United Kingdom. Our independent sales
    representatives and distributors are located in the United
    States, Japan, China, Brazil and other parts of the world. Only
    one of these arrangements is on an exclusive basis. Foreign
    sales to customers are generally priced in local currencies and
    are therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations.

We maintain a customer support and field service staff in our
    major markets within the United States, Europe, Russia, Japan
    and South Korea. We work closely with customers, customer groups
    and independent representatives to service equipment, train
    customers to use our products and explore additional
    applications for our technologies. We typically repair products
    at our facilities or at customer sites. We plan to expand our
    support and field service, particularly in locations where
    customer concentration or volume requires local service
    capabilities.

We typically provide one to three-year warranties on our lasers
    and amplifiers. Warranty reserves have generally been sufficient
    to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs.

Manufacturing

Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include
    optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor
    wafer growth, diode processing and packaging, specialty optical
    component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly
    for different power units, software and electronics development,
    final assembly, as well as testing, tool manufacturing and
    automated production systems. We have recently added additional
    production capabilities, including building redundant diode and
    optical fiber manufacturing in separate facilities, in order to
    increase our capacity as well as reduce the risks associated
    with our production process.

We operate our own semiconductor foundry for the production of
    the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that
    are used as the light source in each device we make. We also
    process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. We also
    design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test
    instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly
    tools and machines.

We developed these proprietary components, manufacturing tools,
    equipment and techniques over many years in an effort to address
    the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of
    fiber laser technology and to provide products that
    differentiate us from our competitors. Generally, we do not sell
    our proprietary components to third parties. Using our
    technology platform, we configure standard products based upon
    each customer’s specifications.

Our in-house manufacturing generally includes only those
    operations and components that are critical to the protection of
    our intellectual property, reducing our costs or to the
    achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase
    from vendors common as well as specialized mechanical,
    electrical and optical parts and raw materials, such as printed
    circuit boards, wafer substrates and various optical components.

Research
    and Development

We have extensive research and development experience in laser
    materials, fiber and optoelectronic components. We focus our
    research and development efforts on designing and introducing
    new and improved standard and customized products and the mass
    production of components that go into our products. In addition
    to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we have core
    competencies in high-power multi-mode semiconductor laser
    diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive optical
    fibers, high-performance optical components, fiber gain blocks
    and fiber modules, as well as splicing and combining techniques
    and high-stress test methods. We concentrate our research and
    development efforts on advancements in performance as well as
    capacity to hold and produce higher optical power levels.



Our research and development efforts are also directed at
    expanding our product line by increasing power levels, improving
    beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing size and
    lowering the cost per watt. Our team of scientists and engineers
    work closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce
    custom products that address specific applications and
    performance requirements.

We incurred research and development costs of approximately
    $6.5 million in 2006, $5.8 million in 2005 and
    $4.8 million in 2004.

Intellectual
    Property

We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through
    U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade secrets,
    and to seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and trademark
    protection of our products and processes where appropriate. We
    do not believe that any of our patents are material to the
    conduct of our business. We rely primarily on trade secrets,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    relating to our product development and manufacturing
    activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary
    information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into
    agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and
    the assignment to us of rights to inventions that they make
    while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure
    agreements with our consultants and suppliers to protect
    confidential information delivered to them. We believe that our
    vertical integration, including our long experience in making a
    wide range of specialty and high-power capacity components, as
    well as our technology platform make it difficult for others to
    reverse engineer our products. Intellectual property rights,
    including those that we own and those of others, involve
    significant risks. See Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —
    Our Inability to Protect Our Intellectual Property and
    Proprietary Technologies Could Result in the Unauthorized Use of
    Our Technologies by Third Parties, Hurt Our Competitive Position
    and Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”

Competition

Our markets are competitive and characterized by rapidly
    changing technology and continuously evolving customer
    requirements. We believe that the primary competitive factors in
    our markets are: product performance and reliability; quality
    and service support; price and value to the customer; ability to
    manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis; ability to
    achieve qualification for and integration into OEM systems;
    ability to meet customer specifications; and ability to respond
    quickly to market demand and technological developments.

In the materials processing market, the competition is
    fragmented and includes a large number of competitors. We
    compete with makers of high-power conventional
    CO


and solid-state lasers, including Fanuc, Lasag Ltd., Rofin-Sinar
    Technologies, Inc., and Trumpf Inc., and makers of mid and
    low-power conventional
    CO


and solid-state lasers such as Coherent, Inc., the Synrad, Inc.
    subsidiary of Excel Technology, Inc., GSI Group Inc., Newport
    Corporation and Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. We also compete
    with fiber laser makers including Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable
    Industries, Ltd., Miyachi Unitek Corporation, MPB Communications
    Inc., SPI Lasers plc and JDS Uniphase Corporation for low

and/or

mid-power lasers. We expect competition from established laser
    makers that may have started or may start programs to develop
    and sell fiber lasers or alternative new solid state laser
    technologies. Because many of the components required to develop
    and produce low-power fiber lasers are becoming increasingly
    available, barriers to entry are decreasing, and we expect new
    competitive products to enter the market. Several
    well-established conventional laser manufacturers are known to
    be interested in developing and licensing technology for fiber
    lasers. We also compete in the materials processing, medical and
    advanced applications markets with end users who produce their
    own solid-state and gas lasers as well as with manufacturers of
    non-laser methods and tools, such as resistance welding in the
    materials processing market and scalpels in the medical market.

In the communications market, our principal competitors are
    manufacturers of high-power fiber amplifiers and DWDM systems,
    such as Avanex Corporation, Bookham, Inc., the
    Scientific-Atlanta division of Cisco Systems, Inc.
    (Scientific-Atlanta), Emcore Corporation, JDS Uniphase
    Corporation and MPB Communications



Inc. The fiber amplifier market is more established than the
    fiber laser market and technological change has not occurred as
    rapidly as it has in the case of fiber lasers.

Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
    1,040 full-time employees, including approximately 60 in
    research and development, 840 in manufacturing operations, 50 in
    sales, service and marketing, and 90 in general and
    administrative functions. Of our total full-time employees at
    our principal facilities, approximately 300 were in the United
    States, 380 were in Germany, 300 were in Russia and 10 were in
    Italy. We have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our
    employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We
    believe that our current relations with our employees are good.

Government
    Regulation

Regulatory
    Compliance

The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the
    United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products
    under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for
    Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) of the
    U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The same classification
    system is applied in the European markets. Safety rules are
    formulated with “Deutsche Industrie Norm” (i.e.,
    German Industrial Standards) or ISO standards, which are
    internationally harmonized. CDRH regulations generally require a
    self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer
    must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product
    incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and
    purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product
    safety and design features and informational requirements. The
    Company’s products applications can result in injury to
    human tissue if directed at an individual or otherwise misused.
    The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for
    violations of their requirements. We believe that our products
    are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations
    relating to the manufacture of laser devices.

Environmental
    Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local
    environmental protection regulations governing the use, storage,
    handling and disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals, various
    radioactive materials and certain waste products. In the United
    States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of
    the Environmental Protection Agency. Comparable authorities are
    involved in other countries. We believe that our operations are
    in material compliance with applicable environmental protection
    laws and regulations.

Although we believe that our safety procedures for using,
    handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with
    the standards required by federal and state laws and
    regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of
    accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the
    event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be
    liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of
    our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our
    business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The factors described below are the principal risks that
    could materially adversely affect our operating results and
    financial condition. Other factors may exist that we do not
    consider significant based on information that is currently
    available. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we
    cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they
    may affect us.

Our
    future growth depends upon our ability to penetrate new
    applications for fiber lasers and increase our market share in
    existing applications.

Our future growth will depend on our ability to generate sales
    of fiber lasers in applications where traditional lasers, such
    as
    CO


and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers, have been used or in
    new and developing markets and applications for lasers where
    they have not been used previously. To date, a significant
    portion of our revenue growth has been derived from sales of
    fiber lasers primarily for applications where
    CO


and YAG lasers historically have been used. In order to increase
    market demand for our fiber laser products, we will need to
    devote substantial resources to:

•

demonstrate the effectiveness of fiber lasers in new
    applications;

•

increase our direct and indirect sales efforts;

•

extend our product line to address new applications for our
    products;

•

continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and enhance our
    competitive position; and

•

effectively service and support our installed product base.

If we are unable to implement our strategy to develop new
    applications for our products, our revenues, operating results
    and financial condition could be adversely affected. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our
    business strategy. In addition, our newly developed or enhanced
    products may not achieve market acceptance or may be rendered
    obsolete or less competitive by the introduction of new products
    by other companies.

If
    fiber lasers do not achieve broader market acceptance or if
    market penetration occurs more slowly than we expect, prospects
    for our growth and profitability may be negatively
    impacted.

The fiber laser market is relatively new when compared to the
    conventional laser market and our future success depends on the
    development and broader market acceptance of fiber lasers.
    Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt fiber lasers as an
    alternative to traditional lasers, such as
    CO


and YAG, and non-laser methods, such as mechanical tools. Such
    potential customers may have substantial investments and
    know-how related to their existing laser and non-laser
    technologies, and may perceive risks relating to the
    reliability, quality, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fiber
    lasers when compared to other laser or non-laser technologies
    available in the market. Many of our target markets, such as the
    automotive, machine tool and other manufacturing, communications
    and medical industries, have historically adopted new
    technologies slowly. These markets often require long test and
    qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes
    before adopting new technologies. As a result, we may expend
    significant resources and time to qualify our products for a new
    customer application, and we cannot assure that our products
    will be qualified or approved for such markets. If acceptance of
    fiber laser technology, and of our fiber lasers in particular,
    does not continue to grow within the markets that we serve, then
    the opportunities to increase our revenues and profitability may
    be severely limited.

We may
    not be able to effectively manage our growth and we may need to
    incur significant costs to address the operational requirements
    related to our growth, either of which could harm our business
    and operating results.

We have been experiencing a period of significant growth and
    expansion, both in the United States and internationally, which
    has required, and will continue to require, increased efforts of
    our management and other resources. Our recent and anticipated
    growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place,
    significant



strain on our research and development, sales and marketing,
    operational and administrative resources. To manage our growth,
    we will need to continue to improve our operational and
    financial systems and expand, train and manage our employees.
    For example, we must implement new modules of our management
    information system, hire and train new sales representatives,
    service and application personnel, and expand our supply chain
    management and quality control operations. This may require
    substantial managerial and financial resources, and our efforts
    in this regard may not be successful. If we fail to adequately
    manage our expected growth, or to improve our operational,
    financial and management information systems, or fail to
    effectively motivate or manage our new and future employees, the
    quality of our products and the management of our operations
    could suffer and our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

Our
    vertically integrated business results in high levels of fixed
    costs that may adversely impact our gross profits and our
    operating results in the event of a reduction in demand for our
    products.

We have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated
    business model, including the fact that approximately 840 of our
    1,040 employees as of December 31, 2006 were employed in
    our manufacturing operations. We cannot adjust these fixed costs
    quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our
    gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net
    sales, is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the
    corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead
    expenses. In addition, because we are a vertically integrated
    manufacturer and design and manufacture our key specialty
    components, insufficient demand for our products may subject us
    to the risk of high inventory carrying costs and increased
    inventory obsolescence. Given our vertical integration, the rate
    at which we turn inventory has historically been low when
    compared to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change
    significantly in the future and believe that we will have to
    maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our
    cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a
    significant amount of working capital invested in inventory and
    changes in our level of inventory to lead to an increase in cash
    generated from our operations when it is sold or a decrease in
    cash generated from our operations at times when the amount of
    inventory is increasing. We may be required to write down
    inventory costs in the future as we have done in the past, and
    the high inventory costs may have an adverse effect on our gross
    profits and our operating results.

We are
    subject to lawsuits alleging that we are infringing third-party
    intellectual property rights. Intellectual property claims could
    result in costly litigation and harm our business.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving
    intellectual property rights in many technology-based
    industries, including our own. We face risks and uncertainties
    in connection with such litigation, including the risk that
    patents issued to others may harm our ability to do business;
    that there could be existing patents of which we are unaware
    that could be pertinent to our business; and that it is not
    possible for us to know whether there are patent applications
    pending that our products might infringe upon, since patent
    applications often are not disclosed until a patent is issued or
    published. Moreover, the frequency with which new patents are
    granted and the diversity of jurisdictions in which they are
    granted make it impractical and expensive for us to monitor all
    patents that may be relevant to our business.

From time to time, we have been notified of allegations and
    claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual
    property rights owned by third parties. We are presently
    defending two patent infringement lawsuits brought by the
    Scientific-Atlanta division of Cisco Systems, Inc., and IMRA
    America, Inc. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
    The Scientific-Atlanta allegations generally relate to erbium
    and ytterbium co-doped optical fiber, and certain products that
    incorporate such fiber. Scientific-Atlanta in its complaint
    alleges willful infringement of one U.S. patent and seeks
    damages in an unspecified amount, treble damages and injunctive
    relief. IMRA America’s allegations generally relate to
    certain unspecified fiber amplifiers that we produce and also
    allege inducement of infringement and contributory infringement
    without specifying any of our products. IMRA America in its
    complaint alleges willful infringement of one U.S. patent
    and seeks damages of at least $10 million, treble damages
    and injunctive relief. These lawsuits concern products made,
    used, sold, offered for sale, or imported in the United States
    and therefore these lawsuits affect products that contribute a
    substantial portion of our revenues. These lawsuits do not
    affect revenues that are derived from products that are not
    made, used, sold, offered for sale or imported in the United
    States. IMRA America and other parties have notified us



that they believe certain of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, or
    the use of these products, infringe the respective parties’
    patents. The subject matter of these assertions is products that
    contribute a substantial portion of our revenues. There can be
    no assurance that we will be able to amicably dispose of our
    pending litigations with Scientific-Atlanta and IMRA America,
    claims or other allegations made against us and claims that may
    be asserted in the future. The outcome of any litigation,
    including the pending litigations, is uncertain. Even if we
    ultimately are successful on the merits of any such litigation,
    legal and administrative proceedings related to intellectual
    property are typically expensive and time-consuming, generate
    negative publicity and divert financial and managerial
    resources. Some litigants against us may have greater financial
    resources and may be able to sustain the costs of complex
    intellectual property litigation more easily than we can.

If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation
    brought against us, including the lawsuits brought by
    Scientific-Atlanta and IMRA America, it could affect our ability
    to sell our products and materially harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. These developments could
    adversely affect our ability to compete for customers and
    increase our revenues. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases
    often seek, and sometimes obtain, injunctive relief.
    Intellectual property litigation commenced against us, including
    the lawsuits brought by Scientific-Atlanta and IMRA America that
    we are presently defending, could force us to take actions that
    could be harmful to our business, competitive position, results
    of operations and financial condition, including the following:

•

stop selling our products or using the technology that contains
    the allegedly infringing intellectual property;

•

pay actual monetary damages, royalties, lost profits or
    increased damages and the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees,
    which individually or in the aggregate may be substantial;

•

attempt to obtain a license to use the relevant intellectual
    property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at
    all; and

•

attempt to redesign the products that allegedly infringed upon
    intellectual property of others, which may be costly or
    impractical.

In addition, intellectual property lawsuits can be brought by
    third parties against OEMs and end users that incorporate our
    products into their systems or processes. In some cases, we
    indemnify OEMs against third-party infringement claims relating
    to our products and we often make representations affirming,
    among other things, that our products do not infringe on the
    intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may
    incur liabilities in connection with lawsuits against our
    customers. Any such lawsuits, whether or not they have merit,
    could be time-consuming to defend, damage our reputation and
    result in substantial and unanticipated costs.

Our
    inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
    technologies could result in the unauthorized use of our
    technologies by third parties, hurt our competitive position and
    adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on trade secret laws, contractual agreements, technical
    know-how and other unpatented proprietary information to protect
    our products, product development and manufacturing activities
    from unauthorized copying by third parties. While we own a small
    number of patents, we have not historically emphasized patents
    as a source of significant competitive advantage, and we do not
    expect these patents alone to prevent third parties from
    unauthorized copying of our technologies, products and product
    components. Rather, we seek to protect our proprietary
    technology under laws affording protection for trade secrets. We
    also seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary
    information, in part, by requiring employees to enter into
    agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and
    the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while
    employed by us. We have significant international operations and
    we are subject to foreign laws which differ in many respects
    from U.S. laws. Policing unauthorized use of our trade
    secret technologies throughout the world and proving
    misappropriation of our technologies are particularly difficult,
    especially due to the number of our employees and operations in
    numerous foreign countries. The steps that we take to acquire
    ownership of our employees’ inventions and trade secrets in
    foreign countries may not have been



effective under all such local laws, which could expose us to
    potential claims or the inability to protect intellectual
    property developed by our employees. Furthermore, any changes
    in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other
    intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate
    may adversely affect our ability to enforce our trade secret and
    intellectual property positions. Costly and time-consuming
    litigation could be necessary to determine the scope of our
    confidential information and trade secret protection. We also
    enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and
    other suppliers to protect our confidential information that we
    deliver to them. However, there can be no assurance that our
    confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that we will be
    able to effectively enforce them or that we will have adequate
    remedies for any breach.

Given our reliance on trade secret laws, others may
    independently develop similar or alternative technologies or
    duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we
    have made. Therefore, our intellectual property efforts may be
    insufficient to maintain our competitive advantage or to stop
    other parties from commercializing similar products or
    technologies. Many countries outside of the United States afford
    little or no protection to trade secrets and other intellectual
    property rights. Intellectual property litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that we
    will have the resources to fully enforce our rights. If we are
    unable to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our
    intellectual property rights, or the independent development or
    design of similar technologies, our competitive position and
    operating results could suffer.

We
    depend upon internal production and on outside single or
    limited-source suppliers for many of our key components and raw
    materials. Any interruption in the supply of these key
    components and raw materials could adversely affect our results
    of operations.

We rely exclusively on our own production capabilities to
    manufacture certain of our key components, such as semiconductor
    diodes, specialty optical fibers and optical components. We do
    not have redundant production lines for some of our components,
    such as our diodes and some other components, which are made at
    a single manufacturing facility. These may not be readily
    available from other sources at our current costs. If our
    manufacturing activities were obstructed or hampered
    significantly, it could take a considerable length of time, or
    it could increase our costs, for us to resume manufacturing or
    find alternative sources of supply. Many of the tools and
    equipment we use are custom-designed, and it could take a
    significant period of time to repair or replace them. In
    particular, we use complex tools in the production of our
    semiconductor diodes that may be taken out of production for
    months to be serviced and the tools must be recertified before
    they are put back into production. If we are unable to
    successfully recommission these tools in a timely fashion, our
    results of operations and business may be adversely affected.
    Our three major manufacturing facilities are located in Oxford,
    Massachusetts; Burbach, Germany; and Fryazino, Russia. If, as a
    result of a flood, fire, natural disaster, political unrest, act
    of terrorism, war, outbreak of disease or other similar event,
    any of our three major manufacturing facilities or equipment
    should become inoperable, inaccessible, damaged or destroyed,
    our business could be adversely affected to the extent that we
    do not have redundant production capabilities.

Also, we purchase certain raw materials used in the manufacture
    of our products and other components, such as semiconductor
    wafer substrates, modulators and high-power beam delivery
    products, from single or limited-source suppliers. In general,
    we have no long-term contractual supply arrangements with these
    suppliers. Some of our suppliers are also our competitors.
    Furthermore, other than our current suppliers, there are a
    limited number of entities from whom we could obtain these
    supplies. We do not anticipate that we would be able to purchase
    these components or raw materials that we require in a short
    period of time or at the same cost from other sources in
    commercial quantities or that have our required performance
    specifications. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any
    of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain
    these components and materials from alternate sources at
    acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could
    adversely affect our business. If our suppliers face financial
    or other difficulties or if there are significant changes in
    demand for the components and materials we obtain from them,
    they could limit the availability of these components and
    materials to us, which in turn could adversely affect our
    business.



We
    rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of
    our senior management and scientific staff and if we are unable
    to retain these key employees and attract other highly skilled
    personnel necessary to grow our business successfully, our
    business and results of operations could suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued
    service of our executive officers, particularly our founder and
    chief executive officer, Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, and our
    managing director of IPG Laser, Dr. Eugene Shcherbakov, our
    highly trained team of scientists, many of whom have several
    years of experience and specialized expertise in optical fibers,
    semiconductors and optical component technology, and other key
    engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support
    personnel, any of whom may leave, which could harm our business.
    The members of our scientific staff who are expected to make
    significant individual contributions to our business are also
    members of our executive management team. Furthermore, our
    business requires scientists and engineers with experience in
    several disciplines, including physics, optics, materials
    sciences, chemistry and electronics. We will need to continue to
    recruit and retain highly skilled scientists and engineers for
    certain functions. Our future success also depends on our
    ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate
    highly skilled research and development, managerial, operations,
    sales, marketing and customer service personnel. If we fail to
    attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our
    ability to extend and maintain our scientific expertise and grow
    our business could suffer significantly.

Failure
    to effectively build and expand our direct field service and
    support organization could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

We believe that it will become increasingly important for us to
    provide rapid, responsive service directly to our customers
    throughout the world and to build and expand our own personnel
    resources to provide these services. Accordingly, we have an
    ongoing effort to develop our direct support systems in Asia,
    one of our largest markets. This requires us to recruit and
    train additional qualified field service and support personnel
    as well as maintain effective and highly trained organizations
    that can provide service to our customers in various countries.
    We may not be able to attract and train additional qualified
    personnel to expand our direct support operations successfully.
    We may not be able to find and engage additional qualified
    third-party resources to supplement and enhance our direct
    support operations. Further, we may incur significant costs in
    providing these direct field and support services. Failure to
    implement our direct support operation effectively could
    adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our
    operating results may suffer.

The
    laser and amplifier industries may experience declining average
    selling prices, which could cause our gross margins to decline
    and harm our operating results.

Products in the laser and amplifier industries generally, and
    our products specifically, have in the past and may in the
    future continue to experience a decline in average selling
    prices (ASPs) as a result of new product and technology
    introductions, increased competition and price pressures from
    significant customers. If the ASPs of our products decline and
    we are unable to increase our unit volumes, introduce new or
    enhanced products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing
    costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our
    existing products, our operating results may be adversely
    affected. In addition, because of our significant fixed costs,
    we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs quickly in
    response to any revenue shortfalls. Because of these factors, we
    may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future
    operating results on a quarterly or annual basis if the ASPs of
    our products continue to decline.

A few
    customers account for a significant portion of our sales, and if
    we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail
    their purchases of our products, our results of operations could
    be adversely affected.

We rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our
    sales. Our top five customers accounted for 29% of our
    consolidated net sales in 2006 and 37% of our consolidated net
    sales in each of 2005 and 2004. Our largest customer accounted
    for 10% of sales in 2006, 13% of sales in 2005 and 20% of sales
    in 2004. We generally do not enter into agreements with our
    customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or
    amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short- term
    purchase orders and shipment schedules. If any of our



principal customers discontinues its relationship with us,
    replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers
    downturns in its business, our business and results of
    operations could be adversely affected.

We
    have experienced, and expect to experience in the future,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These
    fluctuations may increase the volatility of our stock
    price.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We believe that
    fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of
    our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. Factors
    which may have an influence on our operating results in a
    particular quarter include:

•

the increase, decrease, cancellation or rescheduling of
    significant customer orders;

•

the timing of revenue recognition based on the installation or
    acceptance of certain products shipped to our customers;

•

seasonality attributable to different purchasing patterns and
    levels of activity throughout the year in the areas where we
    operate;

•

the timing of customer qualification of our products and
    commencement of volume sales of systems that include our
    products;

•

the rate at which our present and future customers and end users
    adopt our technologies;

•

the gain or loss of a key customer;

•

product or customer mix;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

the relative proportions of our U.S. and international sales;

•

our ability to design, manufacture and introduce new products on
    a cost-effective and timely basis;

•

the incurrence of expenses to develop and improve application
    and support capabilities, the benefits of which may not be
    realized until future periods, if at all;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

foreign currency fluctuations; and

•

our ability to control expenses.

These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict our
    operating results. In addition, our ability to accurately
    predict our operating results is complicated by the fact that
    many of our products have long sales cycles, some lasting as
    long as twelve months. Once a sale is made, our delivery
    schedule typically ranges from four weeks to four months, and
    therefore our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the
    same quarter that they are received and will not enhance our
    ability to predict our results for future quarters. In addition,
    long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses
    without offsetting revenues since customers typically expend
    significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our
    products before making a decision to purchase them. Moreover,
    customers may cancel or reschedule shipments, and production
    difficulties could delay shipments. Accordingly, our results of
    operations are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter
    to quarter, and we may not be able to accurately predict when
    these fluctuations will occur.

Our
    manufacturing capacity may not be at the appropriate size for
    future levels of demand.

In response to an increase in demand for our fiber lasers over
    the last three years, we started adding substantial
    manufacturing capacity at our facilities in the United States,
    Germany and Russia beginning in early 2005, and we are
    continuing to expand our capacity further. A significant portion
    of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment, such
    as our semiconductor production and processing equipment, diode



packaging equipment and diode burn-in stations, are
    special-purpose in nature and cannot be adapted easily to make
    other products. If the demand for fiber lasers or amplifiers
    does not increase from current levels, we may have significant
    excess manufacturing capacity, which could in turn adversely
    affect our business.

Conversely, if demand for fiber lasers or amplifiers increases
    substantially more than we anticipate, our manufacturing
    capacity may not be adequate to meet the increased customer
    demand. As a result, we might not be able to fulfill customer
    orders in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our
    customer relationships and operating results. Moreover, our
    efforts to increase our production capacity may not succeed in
    enabling us to manufacture the required quantities of our
    products in a timely manner or at gross profit margins that we
    have achieved in the past. As a result, the profit margins we
    ultimately achieve on sales of fiber lasers and amplifiers may
    be lower than our historical profit margins.

Future
    downturns in the economy, particularly in the materials
    processing and communications markets, could have a material
    adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by
    our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials
    processing and communications markets. Approximately 82% of our
    revenues during 2006 were in these two markets. Although these
    industries are broad, they are cyclical and have historically
    experienced sudden and severe downturns and periods of
    oversupply, resulting in significantly reduced demand for
    capital equipment, including the products that we manufacture
    and market. For the foreseeable future, our operations will
    continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in
    these markets, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for their
    products or services. Decreased demand for products and services
    from customers in these industries during an economic downturn
    may lead to decreased demand for our products, which would
    reduce our sales or sales growth rate.

We
    depend on our OEM customers and system integrators and their
    ability to incorporate our products into their
    systems

Our future growth will depend in part on our ability to maintain
    existing and secure new OEM customers. Our revenues also depend
    in part upon the ability of our current and potential OEM
    customers and system integrators to develop and sell systems
    that incorporate our laser and amplifier products. The
    commercial success of these systems depends to a substantial
    degree on the efforts of these OEM customers and system
    integrators to develop and market products that incorporate our
    technologies. Relationships and experience with traditional
    laser makers, limited marketing resources, reluctance to invest
    in research and development and other factors affecting these
    OEM customers and third-party system integrators could have a
    substantial impact upon our financial results. Furthermore, if
    our OEM customers or third-party system integrators experience
    financial or other difficulties that adversely affect their
    operations, our financial condition or results of operations may
    also be adversely affected.

Because
    we lack long-term purchase commitments from our customers, our
    sales can be difficult to predict, which could adversely affect
    our operating results.

We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or
    amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase
    orders and shipment schedules and, in some cases, orders may be
    cancelled or delayed without significant penalty. As a result,
    it is difficult to forecast our revenues and to determine the
    appropriate levels of inventory required to meet future demand.
    In addition, due to the absence of long-term volume purchase
    agreements, we forecast our revenues and plan our production and
    inventory levels based upon the demand forecasts of our OEM
    customers, end users, and distributors, which are highly
    unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. This could lead
    to increased inventory levels and increased carrying costs and
    risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to unanticipated
    reductions in purchases by our customers. In this regard, we
    recorded provisions for inventory totaling $1.0 million and
    $1.9 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. These
    provisions were recorded as a result of changes in market prices
    of certain components, the value of those inventories that was
    realizable through finished product sales and uncertainties
    related to the recoverability of the value of inventories due to
    technological changes and excess quantities. If our OEM
    customers, end users or distributors fail to accurately



forecast the demand for our products, fail to accurately
    forecast the timing of such demand, or are unable to
    consistently negotiate acceptable purchase order terms with
    customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

The
    markets for our products are highly competitive and increased
    competition could increase our costs, reduce our sales or cause
    us to lose market share.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by
    significant price and technological competition. Our fiber laser
    and amplifier products compete with conventional laser
    technologies and amplifier products offered by several
    well-established companies, some of which are larger and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do. Also, we compete with widely used
    non-laser production methods, such as resistance welding. We
    believe that competition will be particularly intense from
    makers of
    CO


and YAG lasers, as these makers of traditional solutions may
    lower prices to maintain current market share and have committed
    significant research and development resources to pursue
    opportunities related to these technologies.

Further, we face competition from a growing number of fiber
    laser makers. We also expect competition from established laser
    makers which may have started or may start programs to develop
    and sell fiber lasers or alternative new solid state laser
    technologies. Because many of the components required to develop
    and produce low-power fiber lasers and amplifiers are
    commercially available, barriers to entry into these submarkets
    are relatively low, and we expect new competitive product
    entries in these submarkets. We may not be able to successfully
    differentiate our current and proposed products from the
    products of our competitors and the market may not consider our
    products to be superior to competing products. To maintain our
    competitive position in these markets, we believe that we will
    be required to continue a high level of investment in research
    and development, application development and customer service
    and support, and react to market pricing conditions. We may not
    have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments
    and we may not be able to make the technological advances or
    price adjustments necessary to maintain our competitive
    position. We also compete against our OEM customers’
    internal production of competitive laser technologies.

Our
    inability to manage risks associated with our international
    customers and operations could adversely affect our
    business.

Our products are currently marketed and sold in numerous
    countries. The United States, Germany, Japan and Russia are our
    principal markets. A significant amount of our revenues are
    derived from customers outside of the United States. We
    anticipate that foreign sales will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
    Our operations and sales in these markets are subject to risks
    inherent in international business activities, including:

•

longer accounts receivable collection periods;

•

changes in the values of foreign currencies;

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s economic
    conditions, such as recession;

•

compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and
    regulations and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory
    requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs,
    quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade
    barriers;

•

certification requirements;

•

environmental regulations;

•

less effective protection of intellectual property rights in
    some countries;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;



•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts,
    and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in
    the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers,
    manufacturers and subcontractors are located;

•

preference for locally produced products;

•

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international
    operations across different geographic areas and cultures;

•

seasonal reductions in business activities; and

•

fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.

Political and economic instability and changes in governmental
    regulations could adversely affect both our ability to
    effectively operate our foreign sales offices and the ability of
    our foreign suppliers to supply us with required materials or
    services. Any interruption or delay in the supply of our
    required components, products, materials or services, or our
    inability to obtain these components, materials, products or
    services from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within
    a reasonable amount of time, could impair our ability to meet
    scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause
    customers to cancel orders.

We are also subject to risks of doing business in Russia through
    our indirect subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, which conducts research
    and development and provides components and test equipment to
    us. The results of operations, business prospects and facilities
    of NTO IRE-Polus are subject to the economic and political
    environment in Russia. In recent years Russia has undergone
    substantial political, economic and social change. As is typical
    of an emerging market, Russia does not possess a well-developed
    business, legal and regulatory infrastructure that would
    generally exist in a more mature free market economy. In
    addition, the tax, currency and customs legislation within
    Russia is subject to varying interpretations and changes, which
    can occur frequently. The future economic direction of Russia
    remains largely dependent upon the effectiveness of economic,
    financial and monetary measures undertaken by the government,
    together with tax, legal, regulatory, and political
    developments. Our failure to manage the risks associated with
    NTO IRE-Polus and our other existing and potential future
    international business operations could have a material adverse
    effect upon our results of operations.

Foreign
    currency transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales,
    cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange
    losses.

We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of
    most countries in which we operate. In 2006, our net sales
    outside the United States represented a significant portion of
    our total sales. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one
    of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a
    sales transaction using a different currency from the currency
    in which it receives revenues. We currently do not hedge against
    foreign currency exchange risks, and therefore the impact of
    future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations
    cannot be accurately predicted. Given the volatility of exchange
    rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency
    transaction or translation risks, and any volatility in currency
    exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local
    currency to our foreign customers, which may have an adverse
    effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.

Our
    products could contain defects, which may reduce sales of those
    products, harm market acceptance of our fiber laser products or
    result in claims against us.

The manufacture of our fiber lasers and amplifiers involves
    highly complex and precise processes. Despite testing by us and
    our customers, errors have been found, and may be found in the
    future, in our products. These defects may cause us to incur
    significant warranty, support and repair costs, divert the
    attention of our engineering personnel from our product
    development efforts and harm our relationships with our
    customers. These problems could result in, among other things,
    loss of revenues or a delay in revenue recognition, loss of



market share, harm to our reputation or a delay or loss of
    market acceptance of our fiber laser products. Defects,
    integration issues or other performance problems in our fiber
    laser and amplifier products could also result in personal
    injury or financial or other damages to our customers, which in
    turn could damage market acceptance of our products. Our
    customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. A
    product liability claim brought against us, even if
    unsuccessful, could be time-consuming and costly to defend.

We may
    pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses, products
    or technologies. These may involve risks which could disrupt our
    business and may harm our financial condition.

We currently have no commitments or agreements to make any
    acquisitions and have limited experience in making acquisitions.
    In the future, we may make acquisitions of and investments in
    new businesses, products, technologies and geographic areas, or
    we may acquire operations that expand our current capabilities.
    Acquisitions present a number of potential risks and challenges
    that could, if not met, disrupt our business operations,
    increase our operating costs and reduce the value of the
    acquired company to us. For example, if we identify an
    acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully
    negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms. Even if
    we are successful, we may not be able to integrate the acquired
    businesses, products or technologies into our existing business
    and products. As a result of the rapid pace of technological
    change in our industry, we may misjudge the long-term potential
    of the acquired business or technology, or the acquisition may
    not be complementary to our existing business. Furthermore,
    potential acquisitions and investments, whether or not
    consummated, may divert our management’s attention and
    require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing
    operations. In addition, to complete future acquisitions, we may
    issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent
    liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of
    acquired assets, which could adversely affect our profitability
    and result in dilution to our existing and future stockholders.

We are
    subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could
    impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial
    condition.

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various
    federal, state, local, and international laws governing the
    environment, including those relating to the storage, use,
    discharge, disposal, labeling, and human exposure to hazardous
    and toxic materials. We could incur costs, fines and civil or
    criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal
    injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial
    investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or
    become liable under environmental laws. Liability under
    environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard
    to comparative fault. Compliance with current or future
    environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to
    expand our facilities or require us to acquire additional
    expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes, or
    incur other significant expenses in order to remain in
    compliance with such laws and regulations. At this time, we do
    not believe the costs to maintain compliance with current
    environmental laws to be material. Although we do not currently
    anticipate that such costs will become material, if such costs
    were to become material in the future, whether due to
    unanticipated changes in environmental laws, unanticipated
    changes in our operations or other unanticipated changes, we may
    be required to dedicate additional staff or financial resources
    in order to maintain compliance. There can be no assurance that
    violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur
    in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits,
    human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.

We are
    subject to export control regulations that could restrict our
    ability to increase our international sales and may adversely
    affect our business.

A significant part of our business is the export of our products
    to other countries. Because our products can be used or adapted
    for military, weapons or other similar uses, our products are
    subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered
    by the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Industry
    Security, and their foreign counterpart laws and regulations
    which require that we obtain an export license before we can
    export certain products, components or technology to specified
    countries. Under applicable regulations, some of our laser
    products, components and technology are treated differently than
    traditional



lasers or mechanical tools and, in some cases, the export of our
    products, components and technology to certain countries
    requires an export license even though an export license would
    not be required for the export of a
    CO


or YAG laser or mechanical tool. Unless a license exception is
    available, the stricter controls applicable to some products
    could put us at a competitive disadvantage in selling our
    products to customers in certain countries that require an
    export license, restrict our ability to sell products to
    customers in certain countries, or give rise to delays or
    expenses in obtaining appropriate licenses. Export licenses can
    permit the export of a unit to a single customer, or multiple
    units over a period of time to one or more customers, and may
    include conditions limiting the use of the product, resale,
    transfer, re-export, modification, disassembly or transfer of
    data. We have experienced and, in the future, may experience
    delays in obtaining export licenses as we respond to questions
    from licensing authorities on license requests and await their
    determination to grant permission in instances where a license
    is required. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations
    could result in government sanctions, including substantial
    monetary penalties, denial of export privileges, debarment from
    government contracts and a loss of revenues. Delays in obtaining
    or failure to obtain required export licenses also may require
    us to defer shipments to subsequent periods or cancel orders.
    Any of these could adversely affect our operations and, as a
    result, our financial results could suffer.

We
    could be the subject of securities class action litigation due
    to future stock price volatility, which could divert
    management’s attention and adversely affect our operating
    results.

The stock market in general, and market prices for the
    securities of technology companies like ours in particular, have
    experienced volatility from time to time that often has been
    unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying
    companies. A certain degree of stock price volatility can be
    attributed to being a newly public company. These broad market
    and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price
    of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In
    several recent situations where the market price of a stock has
    been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities
    class action litigation against the company that issued the
    stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit
    against us, the defense and disposition of such lawsuit could be
    costly and divert the time and attention of management and harm
    our business.

Dr. Valentin
    P. Gapontsev, our chairman, chief executive officer and
    principal stockholder, controls more than 46.6% of our voting
    power, and has a significant influence on the outcome of
    director elections and other matters requiring stockholder
    approval, including a change in corporate control.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, our chairman and chief executive
    officer, and IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd. (IPFD), of which
    Dr. Gapontsev is the managing director and majority owner,
    beneficially own an aggregate of 19,999,243 shares of our
    common stock, or approximately 46.6% of our common stock. In
    addition, Dr. Denis Gapontsev, our Vice President of
    Research and Development and the son of Dr. Valentin P.
    Gapontsev, beneficially owns 1,718,902 shares of our common
    stock, or approximately 4.0% of our common stock, and
    collectively with Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, approximately
    50.6% of our common stock. As a result, Dr. Valentin P.
    Gapontsev has significant influence on the outcome of matters
    requiring stockholder approval, including:

•

election of our directors;

•

amendment of our certificate of incorporation or
    by-laws; and

•

approval of mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev may vote his shares of our common
    stock in ways that are adverse to the interests of other holders
    of our common stock. Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev’s
    significant ownership interest could delay, prevent or cause a
    change in control of our company, any of which could adversely
    affect the market price of our common stock.



Dr. Valentin
    P. Gapontsev, our chairman, chief executive officer and
    principal stockholder, owns a material portion of one of our
    operating subsidiaries, which creates the possibility of a
    conflict of interest.

Although we own 51.0% of NTO IRE-Polus, our Russian subsidiary,
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev owns 26.7%, and the remaining
    22.3% is owned by unaffiliated third parties and certain current
    and former employees of NTO IRE-Polus. NTO IRE-Polus conducts
    research and development for us and provides us with components
    and test equipment. Dr. Gapontsev’s significant
    ownership interest in this entity creates the possibility of a
    conflict of interest since, by having an ownership interest in
    both our company and NTO IRE-Polus, his economic interests may
    be affected by transactions between the two entities. Under
    Russian law and NTO IRE-Polus’s charter, supermajority or
    unanimous stockholder approval is required to take certain
    significant non-operational actions, such as amending NTO
    IRE-Polus’s charter, electing the executive body or
    altering certain fundamental stockholder rights. Although we
    have taken steps to address possible conflicts of interests and
    potential issues concerning the requirement to obtain
    supermajority approval, these steps may not prove effective.

Anti-takeover
    provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could
    prevent or delay a change in control of our company, even if a
    change in control would be beneficial to our
    stockholders.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws,
    including certain provisions that will take effect when
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev (together with his affiliates and
    associates) ceases to beneficially own an aggregate of 25% or
    more of our outstanding voting securities, may discourage, delay
    or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control, even if
    it would be beneficial to our stockholders. The existence of
    these provisions could also limit the price that investors might
    be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
    These provisions include:

•

authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred
    stock;

•

establishing a classified board;

•

providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

•

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;

•

limiting the persons who may call a special meeting of
    stockholders;

•

establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for
    election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to
    be submitted to a stockholder vote; and

•

supermajority stockholder approval to change these provisions.

Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent
    someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining
    control of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law, which will apply to our
    company following such time as Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev
    (together with his affiliates and associates) ceases to
    beneficially own 25% or more of the total voting power of our
    outstanding shares, may prohibit business combinations with
    stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

Substantial
    sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to
    decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the
    perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock. As of March 23, 2007, we
    had 42,916,532 shares of common stock outstanding and
    4,392,206 shares subject to outstanding options and
    restricted stock units. Our directors, executive officers and
    other stockholders holding in the aggregate approximately 79% of
    our outstanding shares as of March 23, 2007, have agreed
    not to sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock
    for a period of at least 180 days after December 12,
    2006, the date of the final prospectus relating to the IPO. The
    lock up agreements may be terminated by Merrill Lynch &
    Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc., or in some cases by us. When the

lock-up

agreements expire or are terminated, approximately
    32,484,946 shares of our common stock will be eligible for
    sale under Rule 144, Rule 144(k) or Rule 701.



The holders of an aggregate of approximately
    5,181,184 shares of common stock have registration rights,
    including the right to require us to register the sale of their
    shares and the right to include their shares in public offerings
    we undertake in the future. We have registered all shares of
    common stock that we may issue under our stock option plans.
    Consequently, they may be freely sold in the public market,
    subject to the

lock-up

restrictions described above, and subject, in the case of any
    awards under our stock-based compensation plans, to applicable
    vesting requirements.

We
    will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a
    result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting
    public companies, which could adversely affect our operating
    results.

As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting
    and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company,
    including costs associated with public company reporting
    requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs
    associated with recently adopted corporate governance
    requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002, as well as new rules implemented by the SEC and the
    Nasdaq Global Market. The expenses incurred by public companies
    generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have
    been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to
    significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs
    and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, and
    we may be required to hire additional personnel. We also expect
    these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more
    expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability
    insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy
    limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to
    obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more
    difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to
    serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.

We
    will be required to evaluate our internal control over financial
    reporting under Section 404 of the

Sarbanes-Oxley

Act of 2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could
    result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports
    and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
    beginning as early as the time of the filing of our Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2007, we will be
    required to furnish a report by our management on our internal
    control over financial reporting. Such a report will contain,
    among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our
    fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our
    internal control over financial reporting is effective. This
    assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in
    our internal control over financial reporting identified by
    management. Such report must also contain a statement that our
    independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
    attestation report on management’s assessment of such
    internal controls.

We have begun the systems and process documentation and
    evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. If our
    management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our
    internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to
    assert that such internal control is effective. If we are unable
    to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is
    effective, or if our independent registered public accounting
    firm is unable to attest that our management’s report is
    fairly stated or is unable to express an opinion as to the
    effectiveness of our internal controls, investors could lose
    confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
    reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

We maintain our corporate headquarters in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    and conduct research and development in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    Burbach, Germany and Fryazino, Russia. We operate four
    manufacturing facilities for lasers, amplifiers and components
    in the United States, Germany, Russia and Italy. We also
    manufacture certain optical components in India. We have sales
    personnel at each of our manufacturing facilities and at leased
    offices in Wixom, Michigan; London, England; Tokyo, Japan;
    Nagoya, Japan; Daejeon, South Korea; and Bangalore, India.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our
    current needs and that we will be able to obtain additional
    commercial space as needed.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings and
    other disputes incidental to our business, including those
    described below. For a discussion of the risks associated with
    these legal proceedings and other disputes, see Item 1A.
    “Risk Factors — We Are Subject to Lawsuits
    Alleging That We Are Infringing Third-Party Intellectual
    Property Rights. Intellectual Property Claims Could Result in
    Costly Litigation and Harm Our Business.”

We are a defendant in an action by Scientific-Atlanta filed in
    April 2005 in the United States District Court for the District
    of Massachusetts. The plaintiff alleges in its complaint that
    certain of our products, including but not limited to optical
    fiber amplifier products, infringe one U.S. patent
    allegedly owned by it and seeks damages in an unspecified
    amount, treble damages for alleged willful infringement and
    injunctive relief. Simultaneous with filing the complaint,
    Scientific-Atlanta requested that the U.S. Patent and
    Trademark Office reexamine its patent to consider certain prior
    art. Scientific-Atlanta also presented narrowing amendments to
    many of the issued patent claims and added several new claims.
    The Patent Office granted Scientific-Atlanta’s request to
    reexamine the patent, finding that the new prior art raised a
    substantial new question of patentability. The District Court
    stayed the litigation until the conclusion of the Patent Office
    reexamination and we are awaiting the outcome of the
    reexamination. The patent claims in the issued patent relate
    generally to silicic optical fiber containing certain
    concentrations of erbium and ytterbium together with phosphate.
    The patent expires in January 2011. Although we intend to
    vigorously contest the claims against us, we cannot predict the
    outcome of either the Patent Office reexamination or the
    litigation proceeding.

In January 2007, we settled a lawsuit filed in June 2006 in the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of
    California by Spectra-Physics, Inc., a subsidiary of Newport
    Corporation. The plaintiff alleged in its complaint that certain
    of our optical fiber laser and amplifier products infringe one
    U.S. patent allegedly owned by it.



We are a defendant in an action by IMRA America, Inc. filed in
    November 2006 in the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff alleges in its
    complaint that certain unspecified fiber amplifier products that
    we produce infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA
    America and seeks damages in excess of $10 million, treble
    damages for alleged willful infringement and injunctive relief.
    The plaintiff also makes a general allegation of inducement of
    infringement and contributory infringement that does not specify
    any of our products. The patent claims generally relate to an
    optical amplification system in which a mode converter receives
    an input beam with a nearly diffraction limited mode from a
    laser source and converts the mode to match a fundamental mode
    of a multi-mode fiber amplifier, which amplifier provides at an
    output an amplified beam substantially in the fundamental mode.
    The patent expires in June 2017. Although we intend to
    vigorously contest the claims against us, we cannot predict the
    outcome of the proceeding.

Price
    Range of Common Stock

Our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Market
    on December 13, 2006 under the symbol IPGP. As of
    March 23, 2007, there were approximately
    42,916,532 shares of our common stock outstanding held by
    approximately 200 holders of record, which does not include
    beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the
    names of various securities brokers, dealers and registered
    clearing agencies.

The following table reflects the high and low sales prices of
    our common stock for fiscal 2006 since our initial public
    offering as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market:

Dividends

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital
    stock. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to
    support operations and to finance the growth and development of
    our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends
    in the foreseeable future. In addition, current agreements with
    certain of our lenders contain, and future loan agreements may
    contain, restrictive covenants that generally prohibit us from
    paying cash dividends, making any distribution on any class of
    stock or making stock repurchases.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from
    Registered Securities

During the past three years, we have sold and issued the
    following unregistered securities:

1. In connection with our initial public offering, all
    outstanding shares of our series A preferred stock
    converted in to 359,463 shares of our common stock, all
    outstanding shares of our series B preferred stock
    converted into 7,252,927 shares of our common stock and all
    outstanding shares of our series D preferred stock
    converted into 1,683,168 shares of our common stock.

2. On December 15, 2004, we sold 66,000 shares of
    our common stock to Sujay Shetty, an individual, in exchange for
    277,000 shares of IPG Photonics (India) Private Limited

3. Since January 1, 2004, we have granted options to
    purchase 3,406,546 shares of our common stock at exercise
    prices ranging from $1.50 to $9.60 per share to employees,
    consultants and directors under our 2000 Incentive Compensation
    Plan, our 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan and our Non-Employee
    Directors Stock Plan. From January 1, 2004 through
    March 23, 2007, we have issued 1,685,024 shares of our
    common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options for
    aggregate consideration of $2.5 million.

The sales of securities described in items (1) and
    (2) above were deemed to be exempt from registration
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
    Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an
    issuer not involving a public offering. Each of these sales was
    to “accredited investors,” as such term is defined in
    Rule 501 of Regulation D. Each of the recipients of
    securities in the transactions deemed to be exempt from
    registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    received written disclosures that the securities had not been
    registered under the Securities Act and that any resale must be
    made pursuant to a registration or an available exemption from
    such registration. The issuances of the securities described in
    item (3) above were deemed to be exempt from registration
    pursuant to either Rule 701 promulgated under the
    Securities Act as a transaction pursuant to compensatory benefit
    plans approved by our board of directors or, where such
    recipients of securities under these compensatory plans were
    “accredited investors” because the recipients were
    directors or executive officers of our company, under
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as



transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. None
    of the sales of the securities described in items (1) to
    (3) above involved the use of an underwriter, and no
    commissions were paid in connection with the sale of any of the
    securities that we issued. The sales of these securities were
    made without general solicitation or advertising.

The aggregate net proceeds from the sale by us of
    6,241,379 shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par
    value, in our initial public offering was approximately
    $93.2 million. We did not receive any proceeds from the
    sale by selling shareholders of 4,108,621 shares of our
    common stock sold in the initial public offering. The
    representatives for the several underwriters in the offering
    were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Lehman Brothers. All of
    the shares of common stock sold in the offering were registered
    under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a Registration
    Statement on

Form S-1

(Reg.

No. 333-136521),

effective December 12, 2006. The offering commenced
    December 12 and closed on December 18, 2006. To date,
    $44.9 million of our net proceeds from the initial public
    offering has been applied. In December 2006, we used
    $22.1 million to purchase the series B preferred stock
    warrants and repaid $4.5 million of long-term debt in
    December 2006. In January 2007, we repaid long-term debt in
    Germany and the United States amounting to $18.3 million.
    In connection with the offering, we incurred underwriting
    discounts of $7.2 million and offering expenses of
    $2.6 million. We expect that remaining cash after repayment
    of debt will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital
    needs for the foreseeable future. Pending application of the
    remaining net proceeds, we have invested the remaining net
    proceeds of the offering in cash, cash equivalents and auction
    rate securities with maturities ranging from 30 to 90 days
    in accordance with our investment policy. None of our net
    proceeds were paid directly or indirectly to directors,
    officers, persons owning ten percent or more of our equity
    securities, or our affiliates.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2006, there were no
    repurchases made by us or on our behalf, or by any
    “affiliated purchasers,” of shares of our common stock.

Due primarily to certain stock-based compensation awarded
    primarily in 2000 and 2001, we have recorded significant
    stock-based compensation during the years ended
    December 31, 2002 and 2003. Those awards became fully
    vested during the year ended December 31, 2004. See
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

The change in value of the series B warrants is a non-cash
    charge related to recording the increase or decrease in the fair
    value of the warrants. The change in fair value for this
    derivative instrument is directly related to the probability
    that the warrants would have been exercised prior to their
    expiration in April 2008. We repurchased these warrants on
    December 18, 2006. See Item 7, “Management’s

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with Item 6, “Selected Consolidated
    Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements
    and related notes included in this Annual Report of

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
    materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
    statements as a result of certain factors including, but not
    limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. “Risk
    Factors.”

Overview

We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance
    fiber lasers for diverse applications in numerous markets. Fiber
    lasers are a new generation of lasers that combine the
    advantages of semiconductor diodes, such as long life and high
    efficiency, with the high amplification and precise beam
    qualities of specialty optical fibers to deliver superior
    performance, reliability and usability at a generally lower
    total cost of ownership compared to
    CO


and crystal lasers. Our products are displacing traditional
    lasers in many current applications and enabling new
    applications for lasers.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, communications,
    medical and advanced applications. We sell our products globally
    to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system integrators
    and end users. We market our products internationally primarily
    through our direct sales force and also through agreements with
    independent sales representatives and distributors. We have
    sales offices in the United States, Germany, Italy, United
    Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture
    all key components used in our finished products, from
    semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber
    lasers and amplifiers. Our vertically integrated operations
    allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, ensure access to
    critical components and rapidly develop and integrate advanced
    products while protecting our proprietary technology.

Since our formation in 1990 in Russia, we have been focused on
    developing and manufacturing high-power fiber lasers and
    amplifiers. We established manufacturing and research operations
    in Germany in 1994 and in the United States in 1998. In the
    following years, we developed numerous OEM customer
    relationships for our advanced, active fiber-based products and
    generated a substantial majority of our sales from



communications companies. Despite the significant economic
    downturn in the communications industry during 2001 and 2002, we
    invested in developing and manufacturing our own semiconductor
    diodes, one of our highest-cost components, rather than
    purchasing them from third-party vendors. Also, we developed new
    products with higher output levels, targeting new applications
    and markets outside of the communications industry, particularly
    materials processing.

In December 2006, we completed our IPO of 10,350,000 shares
    of common stock at $16.50 per share, comprised of 6,241,379
    primary shares and 4,108,621 shares offered by selling
    stockholders. In connection with the IPO, all of the outstanding
    shares of our preferred stock were converted into an aggregate
    of 9,295,558 shares of common stock.

Description
    of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses

Net sales.

We derive net sales primarily from
    the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode
    lasers, communications systems and complementary products. We
    develop our products to standard specifications and use a common
    set of components within our product architectures. We sell our
    products through our direct sales organization and our network
    of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system
    integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials
    processing laser systems, communications systems and medical
    laser systems to end users. We also sell our products to end
    users that build their own systems which incorporate our
    products or use our products as an energy or light source. Sales
    of our products generally are recognized upon shipment, provided
    that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured.

Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a
    few weeks to as long as one year or more. Our scientists and
    engineers work closely with OEMs and end users to analyze their
    system requirements and select and meet appropriate
    specifications. Our major products are based upon a common
    technology platform. We continually enhance these and other
    products by improving their components as well as by developing
    new components. Although it is difficult to predict the life
    cycles of our products and what stage of the life cycle our
    products are in, we estimate that our major products are in the
    early stages of their life cycles. Our sales typically are made
    on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase
    commitments.

The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as
    the products mature. These decreases arise from factors such as
    increased competition, the introduction of new products,
    increases in unit volumes and market share considerations. In
    the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to
    penetrate new markets and applications in which previously it
    was not economically feasible for customers to deploy our
    products. Furthermore, we offer volume discounts to customers
    who buy multiple units. We cannot predict the timing and degree
    of these price declines.

Cost of sales.

Our cost of sales consists
    primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct
    labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically
    integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for
    our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe
    our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies,
    leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. For example, we
    believe that our internally manufactured diodes offer
    performance superior to that of commercially available diodes.
    Cost of sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related
    to our manufacturing and engineering operations, related
    occupancy and equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for
    inventory obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories
    are written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as
    excess or obsolete.

Due to our vertical integration strategy, we maintain a
    relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We cannot adjust
    these fixed costs quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market
    conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of net sales, is greatly impacted by our sales volume
    and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead
    expenses. Additionally, because many of our products are
    customized, we are frequently required to devote significant
    engineering resources to the sales process, which we also
    include in cost of product sales as incurred.



Sales and marketing.

Our sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of compensation, costs of
    advertising, trade shows, professional and technical
    conferences, promotions, travel related to our sales and
    marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and
    other marketing costs.

Research and development.

Our research and
    development expense consists primarily of compensation, test and
    development expenses related to the design of our products and
    certain components, and facilities costs. We use a common
    research and development platform for our products. Costs
    related to product development are recorded as research and
    development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

General and administrative.

Our general and
    administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and
    associated costs for executive management, finance and other
    administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated
    facilities costs and other corporate expenses.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

In connection with the issuance of our
    series B preferred stock in 2000, we issued warrants to
    purchase shares of our common stock. In December 2006, we
    repurchased the series B warrants with a portion of the
    proceeds from our IPO. The fair value adjustment to our
    series B warrants was a non-cash benefit or expense
    relating to a change in the fair value of the warrants. These
    warrants were accounted for as a derivative and were exercisable
    only after an initial public offering, a merger or liquidation
    or the sale of a majority of our common stock. A change in the
    fair value of the warrants was based on a change in the
    probability of any of such events occurring prior to the
    expiration of the warrants. We incurred a non-cash benefit or
    expense each quarter based upon the increase or decrease,
    respectively, in the fair value of the warrants until such
    warrants were repurchased. Following the IPO we will record no
    further adjustments to the fair value of these warrants in our
    financial statements because they have been repurchased.

Minority interests in consolidated
    subsidiaries.

Our financial statements
    consolidate the financial results of our subsidiaries, including
    the subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by us. We own all of
    the stock of our subsidiaries, except for 20% of our Italian
    subsidiary, IPG Fibertech S.r.l., 49% of our Russian subsidiary,
    NTO IRE-Polus, 20% of our Japanese subsidiary, IPG Photonics
    (Japan) Ltd. (IPG Japan), and 10% of our Korean subsidiary, IPG
    Photonics (Korea) Ltd. We reduce or increase our net income by
    the net income or loss, respectively, attributable to the
    minority ownership interest in such subsidiaries. In the event
    that any losses attributable to the minority stockholders of
    these subsidiaries exceed the minority interest in the equity
    capital of the subsidiaries, we recognize the amount of such
    excess and any further losses attributable to the minority
    stockholders in full in our consolidated statements of
    operations because either the minority stockholders do not have
    the ability to absorb such losses or they are not obligated to
    do so. Such excess losses historically have not been significant
    and we do not expect them to be significant in future periods.

Factors
    and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial
    Results

In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the
    following factors and trends that our management believes are
    important in understanding our financial performance.

Net sales.

From 2002 to 2006, our net sales
    grew from $22.2 million to $143.2 million,
    representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 59%.
    The principal drivers of our net sales growth have been
    (i) introduction of new products, including our high-power
    lasers, and increasing demand for our products, fueled by the
    decreasing average cost per watt of output power, (ii) the
    expansion of our product line into higher output power levels,
    (iii) the growing market acceptance of fiber lasers,
    (iv) the development of new applications for our products
    and new OEM customer relationships, and, to a lesser extent,
    (v) the level of investment by communications system
    providers for broadband applications. While we believe we have
    multiple opportunities for additional net sales growth, we do
    not expect our net sales percentage growth rates to continue at
    rates as high as those we have historically experienced. Our
    annual revenue growth rates have decreased from 80% in 2004 to
    59% in 2005 and 49% in 2006. We experienced periods of rapid
    growth from 1998 to 2000 and from 2002 to the present, as well
    as a period when net sales decreased in 2001 and 2002 following
    the decline in the communications market. Since 2002, we have
    diversified our end markets and reduced our reliance on any
    particular industry.



In planning our business, we take into account the cyclical
    nature of some of the end markets that we serve, as well as the
    longer-term historical patterns in the development of our
    business. For example, our net sales growth from materials
    processing applications could slow if there is a decline in
    investment in machinery and equipment used in manufacturing. Net
    sales derived from communications sales were adversely affected
    following the increase in inventory levels of communications
    devices in 2000 and 2001. Furthermore, net sales can be affected
    by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new
    applications in the end markets that we serve. The adoption of
    our products by a new customer or qualification in a new
    application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period,
    which may then slow until we further penetrate new markets or
    customers.

Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to
    quarter. The increase and decrease in sales from a prior quarter
    can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers,
    the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our
    customers’ facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time
    orders for products with large purchase prices, and seasonal
    factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity
    throughout the year in the regions where we operate.
    Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half
    of the year than in the first half of the year.

Gross margin.

In the last three years our
    gross margins have increased from 30.4% in 2004 to 35.2% in 2005
    and 44.2% in 2006. Our total gross margin in any period can be
    affected by total net sales in any period, product mix, that is,
    the percentage of our revenue in that period that is
    attributable to higher or lower-power products, and by other
    factors, some of which are not under our control. Due to the
    fact that we have high fixed costs, our costs are difficult to
    adjust in response to changes in demand. Therefore, our
    manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales are volatile
    and can increase or decrease depending on total net sales
    reported in a period. Our product mix affects our margins
    because the selling price per watt is higher for low and
    mid-power devices than for high-power devices. The overall cost
    of high-power lasers may be partially offset by improved
    absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales of
    larger volumes of higher-power products. We regularly review our
    inventory for items that have been rendered obsolete or
    determined to be excess, and any write-off of such obsolete or
    excess inventory affects our gross margins.

The factors that can influence the gross margins derived from
    sales of any individual product include the following:

•

factors that affect the prices we can charge, including the
    features and performance of our products, their output power,
    the nature of the end user and application, and competitive
    pressures;

•

factors that affect the cost of our net sales, including the
    cost of raw materials and components, manufacturing costs and
    shipping costs;

•

production volumes of specific product lines; and

•

in the case of our OEM customers, the type of market that they
    serve and the competitive pricing pressures faced by our OEM
    customers.

Cost of diodes.

Prior to 2004, we used
    semiconductor diodes purchased from a third-party supplier. In
    2004, we began production at our semiconductor diode
    manufacturing facility, which enabled us to significantly reduce
    the cost of our semiconductor diodes and eliminate reliance upon
    suppliers for this component. For many of our products,
    particularly at higher power levels, the cost of diodes is the
    most important factor in determining the price of the product.
    In addition, we have increased the output power of an individual
    semiconductor diode, further reducing our cost per watt. We do
    not anticipate that any further reductions in the cost of diodes
    will be as significant as we have experienced in the past.

Sales and marketing expense.

We expect to
    continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization,
    build and expand applications centers, hire additional personnel
    involved in marketing in our existing and new geographic
    locations and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and
    marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net
    sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses
    will increase in the aggregate.

Research and development expense.

We plan to
    continue to invest in research and development to improve our
    existing components and products and develop new components and
    products. We plan to



increase the personnel involved in research and development and
    expect to increase other research and development expenses. As
    such, we expect our research and development expenses will
    increase in the aggregate.

General and administrative expense.

We expect
    our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase
    as we expand headcount to support the growth of the Company,
    public company reporting obligations and regulatory compliance,
    incur higher insurance expenses related to directors’ and
    officers’ insurance and continue to invest in our financial
    reporting systems. Further, legal expenses may increase in
    response to pending and any future litigation or intellectual
    property matters, the timing and amount of which may vary
    substantially from quarter to quarter.

Major customers.

We have historically depended
    on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net
    sales. The composition of this group can change from year to
    year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a
    percentage of our annual net sales were 29% in 2006, 37% in 2005
    and 37% in 2004. Sales to our largest customer accounted for
    10%, 13% and 20% of our net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our
    relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the
    composition of our net sales to our significant customers will
    continue to change. If any of our significant customers were to
    substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would
    be adversely affected.

Effect of preferred stock on net income and net income per
    share.

Our net income per share computations
    historically have been impacted by our convertible preferred
    stock, convertible debt and the series B warrants which
    were outstanding prior to our IPO in December 2006. We no longer
    have any such convertible debt or equity instruments
    outstanding. As such, our net income per share computations will
    no longer be adjusted for the effects of these convertible
    instruments for the periods following the completion of the IPO.

In connection with the issuance of our series B preferred
    stock, we issued warrants (the series B warrants) to
    purchase, in the aggregate, shares of our common stock valued at
    $47.5 million at an equivalent per-share price of 50% of
    the fair value on the date of an initial public offering of
    common stock or the sale, merger or liquidation of our company.
    The series B warrants constituted freestanding derivatives
    that were accounted for as liabilities at fair value and the
    changes in fair value of the series B warrants were
    recorded as non-cash expenses or benefits. Any increase in the
    fair value of the series B warrants had the effect of
    reducing our reported net income and net income per share. For
    the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the fair
    value of the series B warrants increased by
    $7.4 million, $0.7 million and $0.6 million,
    respectively. We repurchased the series B warrants in
    December 2006 and we recorded incremental expense associated
    with the series B warrants totaling approximately
    $3.1 million, representing the increase in fair value from
    the carrying value on the most recent measurement date to the
    $22.1 million repurchase value. In subsequent quarters, we
    will not recognize any further income or expense with respect to
    the series B warrants.

The terms of our series A preferred stock and series B
    preferred stock included price protection or anti-dilution
    features that constituted a contingent beneficial conversion
    feature (or deemed dividend) that were recorded upon the
    resolution of the contingency, the completion of our IPO. The
    deemed dividend did not reduce net income but did reduce net
    income applicable to common stockholders in the computation of
    net income (loss) per share. We recorded a deemed dividend
    totaling approximately $18.3 million in the quarter ended
    December 31, 2006, the quarter in which our IPO occurred.
    No further deemed dividends associated with the beneficial
    conversion features related to our series A preferred stock
    or series B preferred stock will be required in subsequent
    quarters as all outstanding shares of our series A
    preferred stock and series B preferred stock converted into
    shares of our common stock upon completion of our IPO.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales
    and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are
    subject



to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis we
    re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related
    to inventories, income taxes and the fair value of certain debt
    and equity instruments including stock-based compensation. We
    base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience
    and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under
    the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may
    result in material effects on our operating results and
    financial position. The accounting policies described below are
    those which, in our opinion, involve the most significant
    application of judgment, or involve complex estimation, and
    which could, if different judgments or estimates were made,
    materially affect our reported results of operations and
    financial position.

Revenue recognition.

Our net sales are
    generated from sales of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, diode
    lasers and complementary products. Our products are used in a
    wide range of applications by different types of end users or
    used as components or integrated into systems by OEMs or system
    integrators, and are often used as

sub-assemblies

required for end products manufactured by or for the customer.
    We also sell communications systems that include our fiber
    lasers and amplifiers as components.

We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”
    SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria be met
    before revenue can be recognized: (i) persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or
    services have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or
    determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue from the sale of our products is generally
    recognized upon shipment, provided that the other revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. We have no obligation to
    provide upgrades, enhancements or customer support subsequent to
    the sale. Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is
    divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria
    are met. The consideration for the arrangement is then allocated
    to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. We defer the revenue on multiple element arrangements if
    the fair values of all deliverables are not known or if customer
    acceptance is contingent on delivery of specified items or
    performance conditions. Applicable revenue recognition criteria
    are then applied separately for each separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. Generally, we receive a customer
    purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and product
    shipment terms are free on board (F.O.B.) shipping point.
    Periodically, our revenue arrangements include customer
    acceptance clauses. Revenue is deferred until customer
    acceptance has been obtained.

Inventory.

Inventory is stated at the lower of
    cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Inventory includes parts and
    components that may be specialized in nature and subject to
    rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for inventory items to
    provide for an estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory.
    The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on
    hand, which we compare with estimated future usage. In addition,
    we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with
    estimates of current market value. Write downs are recorded to
    reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with
    respect to any part with costs in excess of current market
    value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently
    difficult, particularly given that we make unique components and
    products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete
    inventory by making our best estimate considering the current
    quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for
    this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often
    have limited information on which to base our forecasts. If
    future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of
    excess and obsolete inventory may change. In addition, during
    2005 we recorded a charge against the remaining diodes that had
    been procured from third parties, other components and finished
    goods that totaled $1.9 million

.

Stock-based compensation.

Prior to
    January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based employee
    compensation arrangements in accordance with the intrinsic value
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Therefore,
    we did not record any compensation expense for stock options we
    granted to our employees where the exercise price was at least
    equal to the fair value of



the stock on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation is
    included in the following financial statement captions as
    follows:

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we complied
    with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 and
    SFAS No. 148, which required that we disclose our pro
    forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share
    as if we had expensed the options at fair value. As a private
    company, we applied the provisions of SFAS No. 123
    using the minimum value computations, which assume no volatility
    in the fair value of our common stock underlying employee stock
    options. In December 2004, SFAS No. 123 was amended
    (now referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)), and we account
    for any newly issued, modified or settled stock awards on or
    after January 1, 2006 at fair value.

We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective
    transition method. Under this method, compensation costs
    recorded during 2006 include: (i) compensation costs for
    all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet
    vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the intrinsic value
    in accordance with the original provisions of APB 25; and
    (ii) compensation costs for all share-based payment awards
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). We allocate and record
    stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period.

Under SFAS No. 123(R), we calculate the fair value of
    stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. Determining the appropriate fair value model and
    calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require
    the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
    life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price
    volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value
    of stock-based payment awards represent management’s best
    estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
    the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors
    change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based
    compensation expense could be materially different in the
    future. The weighted average assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model were 6.25 years for the expected term,
    65% for the expected volatility, 4.75% for the risk-free rate
    and 0% for dividend yield for 2006. Because there is currently
    no public market for our common stock, we are unable to use
    actual price volatility or option life as input assumptions
    within our Black-Scholes valuation model.

The weighted average expected option term for 2006 reflects the
    application of the simplified method set forth in Securities and
    Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 107,

Shared-Based Payment

, which was issued in
    March 2005. The simplified method defines the life as the
    average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted
    average vesting period for all option tranches.

Because there was no public market for our common stock prior to
    December 12, 2006, the fair value of our common stock was
    determined by our board of directors based on consideration of
    relevant factors. Factors considered by our board of directors
    included:

•

independent valuation reports that we received;

•

the

agreed-upon

consideration paid in arms-length transactions in the form of
    convertible preferred stock and common stock;

•

the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our
    common stock at the time of each grant;



•

historical and anticipated fluctuations in our net sales and
    results of operations, which reflect our dependence on certain
    key customers, the cyclical nature of certain of our end markets
    and market acceptance of our products; and

•

the risk of owning our common stock and its non-liquid nature.

For the calculation of expected volatility, because there was no
    public market for our common stock prior to December 12,
    2006, and therefore we lack company-specific historical and
    implied volatility information, we based our estimate of
    expected volatility on the expected volatility of similar
    entities whose share prices are publicly available. We used the
    following factors to identify similar public entities: industry,
    stage of life cycle, size and profitability. We intend to
    continue to consistently apply this process using the same or
    similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical
    information regarding the volatility of our own share price
    becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the
    identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter
    case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.

As stock-based compensation expense recorded in our statement of
    operations for 2006 is based on options ultimately expected to
    vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    stock-based compensation recorded for 2006 reflects an estimated
    forfeiture rate of 5%. For purposes of preparing the pro forma
    information required under SFAS No. 123 for the
    periods prior to 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as they
    occurred.

Income taxes.

We account for income taxes
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes.” Under this method, we determine the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference
    between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The
    tax consequences of most events recognized in the current
    year’s financial statements are included in determining
    income taxes currently payable. However, because tax laws and
    financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and
    measurement of assets, liabilities, equity, net sales, expenses,
    gains and losses, differences arise between the amount of
    taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and the
    tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in
    the financial statements. Because we assume that the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled,
    respectively, a difference between the tax basis of an asset or
    a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will
    result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years
    when the related assets or liabilities are settled or the
    reported amount of the assets are recovered, giving rise to a
    deferred tax asset or liability. We must then periodically
    assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be
    recovered from our future taxable income, and, to the extent we
    believe that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets
    will not be recovered, we must establish a valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets.

We have used our net operating losses in Germany that we have
    previously generated and we are now paying income taxes in
    Germany. In 2006, our valuation allowances related to deferred
    tax assets were reduced by $17.7 million. The reduction
    included $4.6 million related to operating losses used and
    timing differences that were reversed during the year and
    $13.1 million of valuation allowances released in the
    fourth quarter of 2006 after we determined that the underlying
    deferred tax assets primarily consisting of U.S. Federal
    operating loss carryforwards were more likely than not to be
    realized. As of December 31, 2006, the remaining valuation
    allowances were $1.7 million, primarily provided against
    U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards. The release of
    the remaining valuation allowance will depend upon the continued
    improvement in results of our U.S. operations.

Fair value adjustment of warrants.

In
    connection with the issuance of our series B preferred
    stock, we issued warrants to purchase, in the aggregate, shares
    of our common stock valued at $47.5 million at an
    equivalent per-share price of 50% of the fair value on the date
    of an initial public offering of our common stock or the sale,
    merger or liquidation of our company. The warrants were treated
    as a free-standing derivative under SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.” Under SFAS No. 133, the Company was
    required to record a non-cash expense or benefit each quarter,
    based upon the increase or



decrease in the fair value of the warrants, until such warrants
    were repurchased. The warrants were repurchased in 2006 and no
    further charges will be incurred relative to changes in their
    fair market value.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net sales.

Our net sales increased by
    $46.8 million, or 48.6%, to $143.2 million in 2006
    from $96.4 million in 2005. This increase was primarily
    attributable to a higher volume of sales of fiber lasers in
    materials processing applications, where net sales increased by
    $42.7 million or, by 91.0% of the total increase in net
    sales. Medical applications accounted for 8.1% of the total
    increase in net sales. These increases were partially offset by
    a slight decrease in sales in communications applications. The
    growth in net sales resulted primarily from increased market
    acceptance of high-power fiber lasers and the continued growth
    in sales of low and medium-power fiber lasers for materials
    processing. Net sales growth in medical applications resulted
    from an increase in net sales for aesthetic skin procedures.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Our costs of
    sales increased by $17.4 million, or 27.8%, to
    $79.9 million in 2006 from $62.5 million in 2005, as a
    result of the increased sales volume. Our gross margin increased
    to 44.2% in 2006 from 35.2% in 2005 primarily because of a
    reduction in the cost of our internally manufactured optical
    components, including semiconductor diodes, more favorable
    absorption of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of higher
    production volumes.



Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $3.0 million, or 93.8%, to
    $6.2 million in 2006 from $3.2 million in 2005,
    primarily as a result of a $1.5 million increase in
    personnel costs due to the expansion of our worldwide direct
    sales organization and increases in related sales commissions,
    compensation, travel and selling expenses related to the cost of
    products used for demonstration purposes. As we continue to
    expand our sales presence and organization worldwide we expect
    expenditures on sales and marketing to continue to increase.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $0.7 million, or 12.1%, to
    $6.5 million in 2006 from $5.8 million in 2005. This
    increase is primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in
    personnel costs related to higher headcount and increased
    research and development activity. Research and development
    activity continues to focus on enhancing the performance of our
    internally manufactured diodes, optical fibers and components,
    refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields of
    optical components, testing new applications for our existing
    products and developing new products.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expenses increased by $3.9 million, or
    36.8%, to $14.5 million in 2006 from $10.6 million in
    2005, primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in legal,
    consulting and accounting costs attributable to new litigation,
    internal control compliance and financial reporting, a
    $0.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a
    $0.6 million increase in foreign exchange losses
    attributable to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar
    relative to the Euro and Japanese Yen and a $0.5 million
    increase in depreciation.

Interest expense, net.

Interest expense, net
    decreased by $0.3 million, or 16.7%, to $1.5 million
    in 2006 from $1.8 million in 2005, resulting from the
    repayment of term debt as well as lower utilization of our
    German

line-of-credit

facilities during 2006. We expect to generate net interest
    income in 2007 as a result of interest income generated from
    investing the net proceeds from our recent IPO, and reduction of
    interest expense related to repayment of our U.S. and German
    term debt and a reductions in the amounts drawn under our

line-of-credit

facilities, which will be partially offset by interest on the
    subordinated notes that we issued to our series B preferred
    stockholders in connection with the IPO.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

The fair value adjustment of the
    series B warrants increased by $6.7 million to
    $7.4 million in 2006 as a result of our IPO in December
    2006. We will not incur any further charges related to the fair
    value adjustment of the series B warrants after 2006 as we
    repurchased the warrants using part of the proceeds from the IPO.

Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.

Our
    benefit from income taxes in 2006 was $3.0 million, which
    resulted from a reduction in our valuation allowance primarily
    related to the use of operating losses during the year and also
    the release of valuation allowances of $13.1 million
    related to deferred tax assets that we have determined are more
    likely than not to be realized. This compared to a provision for
    income taxes of $4.1 million in 2005. Our effective tax
    rate in 2006 was a benefit of 10.7% as compared to a provision
    of 34.2% in 2005. Excluding the impact of the release of the
    valuation allowance and the $7.4 million fair value
    adjustment to the series B warrants, which is not tax
    deductible, our effective tax rate was 28.3% in 2006 compared to
    32.2% in 2005. The decrease in effective tax rates is primarily
    due to changes in the relative amounts of our taxable income
    generated throughout various tax jurisdictions and benefits
    arising from an effective rate on income arising in the United
    States of zero percent because the income was offset by the use
    of operating losses against which we had previously established
    a valuation allowance. As a result of releasing the valuation
    allowance, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39%
    in 2007.

Net income.

Net income increased by
    $21.8 million, or over 100%, to $29.2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 from $7.4 million for the
    same period in 2005. Our net income as a percentage of our net
    sales increased by 12.7 percentage points to 20.4% for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 from 7.7% for the same period
    in 2005.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2005 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2004

Net sales.

Our net sales increased by
    $35.7 million, or 58.8%, to $96.4 million in 2005 from
    $60.7 million in 2004. This increase was primarily
    attributable to higher sales of fiber lasers in the materials



processing market, where net sales increased by
    $18.4 million or 51.5% of the total increase in net sales.
    Communications, medical and advanced applications each accounted
    for an approximately equal portion of the remaining increase in
    net sales. The growth in net sales resulted primarily from
    increased market acceptance of fiber lasers in materials
    processing applications, particularly high-power fiber lasers,
    and to a lesser extent, broadband systems rollouts that
    increased fiber amplifier sales. In addition, sales for medical
    applications grew by almost $5.9 million to
    $7.4 million in 2005 due principally to qualification of
    our products by a customer in 2004.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Our cost of
    sales increased by $20.2 million, or 47.8%, to
    $62.5 million in 2005 from $42.3 million in 2004, as a
    result of increased sales volumes. Our gross margin increased to
    35.2% in 2005 from 30.4% in 2004 because of a reduction in the
    cost of our internally manufactured components, including
    semiconductor diodes, and more favorable absorption of fixed
    manufacturing costs as a result of higher production volumes.
    The increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher
    manufacturing and labor costs and a shift in product mix to
    sales of lower-margin high-power fiber lasers and lower-margin
    fiber amplifiers as well as slightly reduced sales of
    higher-margin low-power fiber lasers.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $0.8 million, or 33.3%, to
    $3.2 million in 2005 from $2.4 million in 2004 as a
    result of a $0.4 million increase in personnel costs
    associated with the increase in sales commissions and the
    expansion of our worldwide direct sales organization.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $1.0 million, or 20.8%, to
    $5.8 million in 2005 from $4.8 million in 2004. The
    increase in our research and development expense was primarily
    attributable to a $1.9 million increase in personnel costs
    due to increased headcount, which was partially offset by a
    decrease in other development expenses.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expense increased by $2.4 million, or
    29.3%, to $10.6 million in 2005 from $8.2 million in
    2004, primarily due to a $2.7 million increase in personnel
    costs, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in
    certain other expenses such as travel and lease expenses.

Interest expense, net.

Interest expense, net
    decreased by $0.4 million, or 18.2%, to $1.8 million
    in 2005 from $2.2 million in 2004. The decrease resulted
    from the repayment of debt.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

The fair value adjustment of the
    series B warrants increased by $0.1 million to
    $0.7 million in 2005 from $0.6 million in 2004 due to
    an increase in the probability of their exercise as well as a
    lower total discount related to the time value of money.

Benefit from (provision for) income taxes.

Our
    provision for income tax expense increased by $5.7 million,
    to $4.1 million in 2005 from a benefit of $1.6 million
    in 2004, representing an effective tax rate of 32.2% in 2005 and
    more than negative 100% in 2004. The $1.6 million benefit
    in 2004 largely reflects the reversal of $1.6 million in
    reserves for prior year taxes as a result of the completion of a
    tax audit in the United States. The relative amounts of our
    taxable income generated between Germany and the United States
    have a significant impact on our effective rate. In each of 2005
    and 2004, we did not provide any benefits on our operating
    losses in the United States, whereas in Germany we have
    historically been profitable and recorded a tax provision
    without a valuation allowance. Absent the effects of the
    valuation allowance, our blended worldwide effective tax rate is
    estimated to have been approximately 40% in each of 2005 and
    2004.

Net income.

Our net income increased by
    $5.4 million to $7.4 million in 2005 from
    $2.0 million in 2004 and our net income as a percentage of
    our net sales increased by 4.4 percentage points to 7.7% in
    2005 from 3.3% in 2004.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2006
    consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $75.7 million and
    unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of
    $13.8 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents
    of $8.5 million and unused credit lines and overdraft
    facilities of $5.0 million as of December 31,



2005. Our total working capital as of December 31, 2006 was
    $115.7 million, compared to $21.5 million as of
    December 31, 2005.

In December 2006, we completed and received $93.2 million
    in proceeds from our IPO (net of $9.8 million of expenses
    related to the offering). In December 2006, we used
    $22.1 million of the net proceeds to purchase the
    series B warrants and $4.5 million to repay long-term
    debt. In the first quarter of 2007, we used an additional
    $18.3 million of proceeds to repay substantially all of our
    bank term debt except for the $20.0 million subordinated,
    unsecured, variable-rate notes, which mature in 2009. We expect
    that the remaining cash after repayment of debt and cash
    generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our
    liquidity and capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our
    future long-term capital requirements will depend on many
    factors including our rate of net sales growth, the timing and
    extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion
    of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and
    introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to
    adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market
    acceptance of our products. We have made no arrangements to
    obtain additional financing, and there is no assurance that such
    additional financing, if required or desired, will be available
    in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Although we repaid substantially all our fixed-term debt with a
    portion of the proceeds of the IPO in the first quarter of 2007,
    we intend to maintain availability under our lines of credit to
    finance our short term working capital requirements that may
    arise from time to time.

This loan has a minimum debt service coverage covenant, which

    (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization, plus stock-based compensation and fair value
    adjustments to the series B warrants, less unfunded capital
    expenditures and cash taxes paid, divided by (ii)(a) current
    maturities of long-term debt and capital leases, plus
    (b) interest expense, measured as of each fiscal quarter.
    We are also required to maintain a ratio of not less than
    2.50:1.00 of current assets to current liabilities and a ratio
    of not less than 2.01:1.00 of total liabilities to tangible net
    worth, measured each fiscal quarter.

Operating activities.

Cash provided by
    operating activities was $19.2 million and
    $13.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating
    activities of $5.6 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 was
    primarily due to an increase in net income of $21.8 million
    and an increase in cash resulting from higher income taxes and
    accounts payable. This increase in cash generated from our
    operations was partially offset by cash used to purchase
    inventory and the repayment of $5.1 million of convertible
    notes payable, originally issued to a vendor in settlement of a
    contract dispute. Cash flows generated by operating activities
    were $13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005
    as compared to cash generated by operating activities of
    $6.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004.

Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming
    testing procedures for both internally manufactured and
    externally purchased components and the lead time required to
    manufacture components used in our finished product, the rate at
    which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared
    to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change
    significantly in the future and believe that we will have to
    maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our
    cost of sales. As a result we continue to expect to have a
    significant amount of working capital invested in inventory and
    for changes in our level of inventory to lead to an increase in
    cash generated from our operations when it is sold or a decrease
    in cash generated



from our operations at times when the amount of inventory is
    increasing. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of
    growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean
    that the rate which we are able to convert our inventory into
    accounts receivable would decrease.

Investing activities.

Cash used in investing
    activities was $19.1 million in 2006 as compared to cash
    used in investing activities of $8.6 million in 2005. The
    cash used in investing activities in 2006 was related to capital
    expenditures on plant and machinery and equipment of
    $20.4 million, primarily in the United States and Germany,
    which was partially offset by loan repayments from certain of
    our stockholders. In 2005, capital expenditures of
    $16.0 million were offset by a one-time cash inflow from
    investing activities of $6.6 million related to the release
    of restricted cash. We expect to continue to invest in plant and
    machinery and to use a significant amount of our cash generated
    from operations to finance capital expenditures. The timing and
    extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can
    have a significant effect on the cash flow. Many of the capital
    expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and
    are difficult to cancel or defer in the event that our net sales
    are reduced or if our rate of growth slows, with the result that
    it would be difficult to defer committed capital expenditures to
    a later period. Cash used in investing activities was
    $8.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 as
    compared to cash used in investing activities of
    $3.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2004.

Financing activities.

Cash provided by
    financing activities was $66.9 million in 2006 as compared
    to $1.1 million in 2005. The increase in cash from
    financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds
    of $93.2 million from our IPO in December 2006, partially
    offset by the purchase of the series B warrants for
    $22.1 million and $4.3 million that we used to repay
    long-term debt. The primary source of cash in financing
    activities in 2005 was $1.0 million proceeds from the
    exercise of stock options. Cash provided by financing activities
    was $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2005
    as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2004.

    2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards
    Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in
    the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides
    guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and
    transitions. FIN 48 will be effective for us beginning
    January 1, 2007. We are currently analyzing the effects, if
    any, of the adoption of FIN 48. We do not anticipate that
    adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our results
    of operations or financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements,” which addresses how
    companies should measure fair value when they are required to
    use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
    under generally accepted accounting principles. The provisions
    of SFAS No. 157 are



effective for us beginning after January 1, 2008. We have
    not yet adopted this pronouncement and we are currently
    evaluating the expected impact that the adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial
    position and results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities,” which provides companies with an option to
    report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value.
    SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and
    disclosure requirements relating to the use of fair values
    within the financial statements. The provisions of
    SFAS No. 159 are effective for us beginning after
    January 1, 2008. We have not yet adopted this pronouncement
    and are currently evaluating the expected impact that the
    adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated
    financial position and results of operations.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of
    business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk
    associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt and
    foreign exchange rate risk.

Interest rate risk.

Our investments have
    limited exposure to market risk. To minimize this risk, we
    maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market
    funds and short-term government funds. The interest rates are
    variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because
    of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change
    in market interest rates would not be expected to have a
    material impact on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or
    decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our
    bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. The
    interest rate on our existing bank debt is currently fixed
    except for our U.S. demand line of credit. The rates on our
    Euro overdraft facilities in Germany and Italy and our Japanese
    Yen overdraft facility are fixed for twelve-month periods.
    Approximately 82% of our outstanding debt had a fixed rate of
    interest as of December 31, 2006. All of our U.S. and
    German term debt was repaid in the first quarter of 2007 except
    for the $20 million of subordinated notes issued to our
    series B stockholders upon completion of our IPO. We do not
    believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a
    material impact on our financial position or results of
    operations.

Exchange rates.

Due to our international
    operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of
    sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other
    than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro and the Japanese
    Yen. As a result, our international operations give rise to
    transactional market risk associated with exchange rate
    movements of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the Japanese
    Yen. Charges related to losses on foreign exchange transactions
    are reported as a component of general and administrative
    expense and totaled $0.8 million, $0.1 million and
    $0.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Historically, we have not utilized any derivative instruments or
    other measures to protect us against foreign currency exchange
    rate fluctuations. We will continue to analyze our exposure to
    currency exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial
    hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the
    effect of these potential fluctuations. However, exchange rate
    fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the
    future.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our
    chief financial officer, our management has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the
    period covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,
    our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
    concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
    we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
    the related consolidated statements of operations, convertible
    redeemable preferred stock and stockholders’ equity, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IPG
    Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment,” effective January 1, 2006.

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

NATURE OF
    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Nature of Business

— IPG Photonics Corporation
    (the “Company”) designs and manufactures a broad line
    of high-performance fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers for
    diverse applications in numerous markets, such as materials
    processing, communications, medical and advanced applications.
    The Company’s world headquarters are located in Oxford,
    Massachusetts, U.S.A. The Company also has operations in
    Burbach, Germany; Milan, Italy; London, England; Fryazino,
    Russia; Tokyo, Japan; Bangalore, India; and Daejon, South Korea.

In December 2006, the Company completed an initial public
    offering of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s
    shares of common stock trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under
    the symbol “IPGP”.

Principles of Consolidation

— The Company was
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1998. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany
    balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Stock Split

— The accompanying financial
    statements reflect a

2-for-3

reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock which
    occurred on December 7, 2006. All share and per share
    information herein has been retroactively restated to reflect
    this split.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

— The financial information
    for entities outside the United States is measured using local
    currencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities
    are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in
    effect on the respective balance sheet dates. Income and
    expenses are translated into U.S. dollars based on the
    average rate of exchange for the corresponding period. Exchange
    rate differences resulting from translation adjustments are
    accounted for directly as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income. Gains or losses from foreign currency
    transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of
    operations and have not been material for any period presented.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments, such
    as bank deposits, with insignificant interest rate risk and
    original maturities of three months or less at the date of
    acquisition.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis. Inventories include parts and components that
    may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence.
    The Company periodically reviews the quantities and carrying
    values of inventories to assess whether the inventories are
    recoverable. The costs associated with provisions for excess
    quantities, technological obsolescence, or component rejection
    are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

— Property,
    plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line
    method based on the estimated useful lives of the related
    assets. In the case of leasehold improvements, the estimated
    useful lives of the related assets do not exceed the remaining
    terms of the corresponding leases. The following table presents
    the assigned economic useful lives of property, plant, and
    equipment:

Category

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations. Interest expense associated with significant capital
    projects is capitalized as a cost of the project. The Company
    capitalized $198,000, $239,000 and $0 of interest expense in
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

— Long-lived
    assets, which consist primarily of property, plant, and
    equipment, are reviewed by management for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. In cases in which undiscounted
    expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an
    impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the
    carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets.

Revenue Recognition

— The Company recognizes
    revenue in accordance with SEC Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”
    SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria be met
    before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or
    services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and
    determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Revenue from the sale of the Company’s products is
    generally recognized upon shipment, provided that the other
    revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company has no
    obligation to provide upgrades, enhancements or customer support
    subsequent to the sale.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied
    separately for each unit of accounting. The Company defers
    revenue on multiple element arrangements if the fair values of
    all deliverables are not known or if customer acceptance is
    contingent on delivery of specified items or performance
    conditions.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. Generally, the Company receives
    a customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and
    product shipment terms are free on board (F.O.B.) shipping point.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company
    maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the
    estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be
    collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer
    creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of
    outstanding receivables.

Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was as
    follows (in thousands):

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Warranties

— In general, the Company’s
    products carry a warranty against defect for a period of one to
    three years, depending upon the product type and customer
    negotiations. The expected cost associated with these warranty
    obligations is recorded when the revenue is recognized. Accrued
    warranty costs amounted to $1,998,000 and $1,065,000 at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Advertising Expense

— The cost of advertising
    is expensed as incurred. The Company conducts substantially all
    of its sales and marketing efforts through trade shows,
    professional and technical conferences, direct sales and use of
    its website. The Company’s advertising costs were not
    significant for the periods presented.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net
    operating loss carryforwards and credits using enacted rates in
    effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
    allowances are provided against deferred tax assets that are not
    deemed to be recoverable.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk
    consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts
    receivable. The Company maintains substantially all of its cash
    in financial institutions that it believes to be high-credit,
    quality financial institutions. The Company grants credit to
    customers in the ordinary course of business and provides a
    reserve for potential credit losses. Such losses historically
    have been within management’s expectations (see discussion
    related to significant customers in Note 14).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts
    receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt. The current
    carrying amounts of such instruments are considered reasonable
    estimates of their fair market value, due to the short maturity
    of these instruments or as a result of the competitive market
    interest rates, which have been negotiated.

Comprehensive Income

— Comprehensive income
    includes charges and credits to equity that are not the result
    of transactions with stockholders. Included in other
    comprehensive income for the Company is net income and the
    cumulative translation adjustment. These adjustments are
    accumulated within the consolidated statements of convertible
    redeemable preferred stock and stockholders’ equity under
    accumulated other comprehensive income.

Derivative Instruments

— The Company has
    entered into financial instruments that constitute freestanding
    derivative instruments. The Company accounts for these
    arrangements in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”), as well as related
    interpretations. Derivative instruments are recognized as either
    assets or liabilities in the balance sheets and are measured at
    fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other
    comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative.
    The Company determines the fair value of derivative instruments
    based on available market data using appropriate valuation
    models, giving consideration to all of the rights and
    obligations of each instrument.

The Company occasionally enters into a financial instrument that
    contains a derivative instrument that is embedded in the
    financial instrument. Upon entering into the instrument, the
    Company assesses (i) whether the economic characteristics

    the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the
    financial instrument (i.e. the host contract), (ii) whether
    a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded
    instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument
    and (iii) whether the instrument is indexed to the
    Company’s own stock and would be classified in
    stockholders’ equity. When it is determined that
    (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic
    characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the
    economic characteristics of the host contract, (2) a
    separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
    derivative instrument or (3) the embedded derivative is not

indexed to the Company’s own stock or would be classified
    outside of stockholders’ equity, the embedded derivative is
    separated from the host contract and carried at fair value.

Beneficial Conversion

— When the Company issues
    debt or equity that is convertible into common stock at a
    discount from the common stock fair value at the date the debt
    or equity is issued, a beneficial conversion feature for the
    difference between the fair value and the conversion price
    multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion is
    recorded as a beneficial conversion charge or deemed dividend.
    The beneficial conversion feature is presented as a discount to
    the related debt or a deemed dividend to the related equity
    holders, with an offsetting amount increasing additional paid-in
    capital.

Business Segment Information

— The Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information

(“SFAS No. 131”),
    establishes standards for reporting information about operating
    segments. The Company is structured with eight distinct legal
    entities in eight different countries; however, the Company
    operates in one segment as each of its legal entities have
    similar economic characteristics and each meets the criteria for
    aggregation as defined in SFAS No. 131. All of the
    Company’s operations involve the design, development,
    production and distribution of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers
    and related optical components. As disclosed in Note 14,
    the Company monitors and maintains information on the sale of
    its products into its various end markets, including
    (i) materials processing, (ii) communications,
    (iii) medical and (iv) advanced applications, but the
    Company does not maintain separate operating financial
    information for these end markets or on any other basis. The
    Company’s product lines, customer base and manufacturing
    processes are similar throughout the world, with little
    distinction between legal entity or product end market. The
    Company has a single, company-wide management team that
    administers all properties as a whole rather than as discrete
    operating segments. The chief decision maker measures financial
    performance as a single enterprise and not on legal entity or
    end-market basis. Throughout the year, the chief decision maker
    allocates capital resources on a

project-by-project

basis across the Company’s entire asset base to maximize
    profitability without regard to legal entity or end-market basis.

Reclassifications

— Certain reclassifications
    have been made in prior years’ consolidated financial
    statements to conform to the 2006 presentation, including the
    reclassification of $2.1 million of demonstration units and
    equipment leased to customers from inventory to other long-term
    assets in 2005

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

—  In July
    2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
    recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and
    transitions. FIN 48 will be effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2007. The Company is currently
    analyzing the effects, if any, of the adoption of FIN 48,
    but does not anticipate that the results of adoption will have a
    material impact on its reported results of operations or
    financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”), which addresses how
    companies should measure fair value when they are required to
    use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
    under generally accepted accounting principles. The provisions
    of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Company
    beginning after January 1, 2008. The Company has not yet
    adopted this pronouncement and is currently evaluating the
    expected impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
    have on the Company’s consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 159”), which provides
    companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements relative to
    the use of fair values within the financial statements. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(“SFAS No. 123”),
    encouraged, but did not require, companies to record
    compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at
    fair value. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, for the
    years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company elected
    to account for stock-based compensation awarded to employees
    using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
    Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
    interpretations and adopted the disclosure-only provisions of
    SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, for financial reporting
    purposes, compensation cost for stock options granted to
    employees and directors was measured as the excess, if any, of
    the estimated fair market value of the Company’s stock at
    the deemed measurement date over the amount an employee or
    director must pay to acquire the stock.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”).
    SFAS No. 123(R)established accounting for stock-based
    awards exchanged for employees’ services and other
    stock-based transactions. Stock-based compensation cost is
    measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the
    award, and is recorded as compensation cost over the requisite
    service period.

Stock-based compensation is included in the following financial
    statement captions for the years ended December 31, as
    follows (in thousands):

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the
    prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation
    costs recorded during 2006 include: (a) compensation costs
    for all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet
    vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the intrinsic value
    in accordance with the original provisions of APB 25 and
    (b) compensation costs for all share-based payment awards
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company allocates
    and records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period.

Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company calculates the fair
    value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. Determining the appropriate fair value
    model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment
    awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions,
    including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards
    and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating
    the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent
    management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve
    inherent uncertainties and the application of management
    judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses
    different assumptions, the Company’s stock-based
    compensation expense could be materially different in the
    future. The weighted average assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model were 6.25 years for the expected term,
    65% for the expected volatility, 4.75% for the risk-free rate
    and 0% for dividend yield for the year ended December 31,
    2006.

F-11


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted average expected option term for 2006 reflects the
    application of the simplified method set forth in Securities and
    Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 107,

Share Based Payment

, which was issued in
    March 2005. The simplified method defines the life as the
    average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted
    average vesting period for all option tranches.

For the calculation of expected volatility, because there was no
    public market for the Company’s common stock until
    December 13, 2006, and therefore a lack of company-specific
    historical and implied volatility information, the Company based
    its estimate of expected volatility on the expected volatility
    of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available.
    The Company used the following factors to identify similar
    public entities: industry, stage of life cycle, size and
    profitability. The Company intends to continue to consistently
    apply this process using the same or similar entities until a
    sufficient amount of historical information regarding the
    volatility of its own share price becomes available, or unless
    circumstances change such that the identified entities are no
    longer similar to the Company. In this latter case, more
    suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly
    available, would be utilized in the calculation.

As stock-based compensation expense recorded in the
    Company’s statement of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 is based on options ultimately expected
    to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    stock-based compensation recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 reflects an estimated forfeiture rate of
    5%. For the purposes of preparing the pro forma information
    required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to
    2006, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.

In accordance with the prospective transition method, the
    Company’s financial statements for prior periods have not
    been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

If the compensation costs for options awarded to employees and
    directors had been determined using the fair value and amortized
    to expense over the vesting period of the awards, the recorded
    net income would have been for the years ended December 31,
    as follows (in thousands):

The Company’s pro forma calculations for 2005 and 2004 were

    weighted-average assumptions: expected life of four years; stock
    volatility of 0%; risk-free interest rate of 4.5% in 2005 and
    3.5% in 2004; and no dividend payments during the expected term.

Incentive Plans

— In April 2000, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the 2000 Incentive
    Compensation Plan, or 2000 plan, and in February 2006, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the 2006 Incentive
    Compensation Plan, or 2006 plan, which provide for the issuance
    of stock options and other stock and non-stock based awards to
    the Company’s directors, employees, consultants and
    advisors. The Company reserved 5,833,333 shares under the
    2000 plan and 4,000,000 shares under the 2006 plan for the
    issuance of awards under the plans. In June 2006, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the Non-Employee
    Directors Stock Plan (the “Directors Plan”), or the
    directors plan. Only non-employee directors are eligible to
    receive awards under the Directors Plan. The Company reserved
    166,667 shares for issuance under the Directors Plan. Under
    the three plans, the Company may grant nonstatutory stock
    options at exercise prices at least equal to the fair market
    value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant,
    unless the board of directors or

F-12


IPG

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

compensation committee determines otherwise on the date of
    grant. Incentive stock options may be granted under the 2000
    plan and the 2006 plans at exercise prices equal to or exceeding
    the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
    Options generally become exercisable over periods of two to five
    years and expire seven to ten years from the date of the grant.
    The awards under the 2000 plan and the 2006 plans may become
    exercisable earlier upon the occurrence of certain change of
    control events at the election of the board of directors or
    compensation committee, and all awards under the directors plan
    automatically become exercisable upon a

change-of-control.

At December 31, 2006, 3,129,461 shares were available
    for future grant under the three option plans.

Euro Overdraft Facilities

— The Company
    maintains a syndicated overdraft facility with available
    principal of Euro 4,895,500 (approximately $6,458,000 at
    December 31, 2006). Of the total amount,
    Euro 1,873,000 (approximately $2,471,000 at
    December 31, 2006) is available at least through March
    2010, Euro 2,000,000 (approximately $2,639,000 at

    and Euro 1,022,500 (approximately $1,349,000 at
    December 31, 2006) is available through May 2007. This
    facility bears interest at market rates that vary depending upon
    the principal outstanding (from 7.5% to 8.6% at
    December 31, 2006). This facility and the Euro Construction
    Loan are collateralized by a common pool of the assets of the
    German entity. A portion of this loan is partially guaranteed by
    the Company’s largest stockholder. At December 31,
    2006, the availability under the Euro Overdraft Facility totaled
    $6,458,000.

The Company also maintains Euro credit lines in Italy with
    available principal of Euro 650,000 (approximately $858,000 as
    of December 31, 2006) which bear interest at rates
    ranging from 5.2% to 7.0%. At December 31, 2006, the
    remaining availability under the Euro credit lines was $774,000.

U.S. Line of Credit

— The Company
    maintains a credit line with available principal of 80% of
    eligible receivables, up to $7,000,000, on a revolving basis.
    This facility bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 3%
    (8.33% at December 31, 2006). The facility terminates in
    June 2007, and is collateralized by all the assets held by the
    U.S. parent company. At December 31, 2006, the
    availability under the U.S. Line of Credit totaled
    $4,009,000.

Japanese Line of Credit

— In September 2006,
    the Company negotiated two credit lines with available principal
    of 100% of eligible receivables, up to JPY 600,000,000
    (approximately $5,037,000 at December 31, 2006), on a
    revolving basis. These facilities bear interest at rates ranging
    from 2.0% to 2.13% at December 31, 2006. The facility is
    renewable annually and collateralized by accounts receivable and
    inventory in Japan. At December 31, 2006, the availability
    under the Japanese Line of Credit totaled $2,518,000.

IPFD Credit Facility

— Through July 31,
    2006, the Company maintained a credit line with available
    principal of $4,600,000 on a revolving basis with its affiliate
    and stockholder, IPFD. Principal drawn under the facility
    accrued interest at a rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate
    in effect on the date of the drawdown plus 2%. As discussed in
    Note 8, the IPFD Credit Facility was terminated on
    July 31, 2006.

IPG

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The rights and preferences of the preferred stock prior to their
    conversion were as follows:

Dividends

— The holders of the Series A,
    Series B, and Series D, are not entitled to dividends
    at any fixed rate, but are entitled to receive dividends at the
    rate paid, if any, on the common shares.

Liquidation

— In the event of any voluntary or
    involuntary liquidation or dissolution of the Company, each
    holder of the Series A, Series B, and Series D
    was entitled to be paid, before any distributions are made to
    the common stockholders or other junior stockholders, a
    liquidation preference. The holders of the Series A,
    Series B, and Series D were entitled to be paid an
    amount equal to the preference value of $10.00, $25.00 and
    $1.90 per share, respectively, plus, in each case, accrued
    and unpaid dividends. In addition, the holders of the
    Series B would have participated in further distributions
    available for the common shares in the amount that would have
    been payable per share if the Series B had been converted
    to common shares.

Voting Rights

— The holders of Series A
    were not entitled to vote on any matters other than those
    affecting the rights and preferences of their shares. The
    holders of the Series B and Series D were entitled to
    vote on matters with holders of common shares in an amount equal
    to the number of common shares into which the Series B and
    Series D were then convertible.

Redemption

— Prior to their conversion into
    common stock, the holders of Series B and Series D had
    redemption rights. The Series B was being accreted to its
    redemption value through the redemption dates. Accretion totaled
    $1,994,000, $2,351,000 and $2,351,000 for each of the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Conversion

— The Series A, Series B
    and Series D were convertible into the number of shares of
    common stock of the Company determined by dividing their
    respective preference values by their respective conversion
    values then in effect. The preference values of the
    Series A, Series B and Series D were $10.00,
    $25.00 and $1.90 per share, respectively, and the
    conversion values at the time of their conversion were $14.27,
    $33.83 and $3.03 per share, respectively. In December 2005
    and January 2006, the conversion rights and obligations of the
    Series B and Series A, respectively, were amended to
    modify their automatic conversion right into common shares upon
    public offerings that met specific conditions.

Upon a public offering meeting certain conditions, all
    Series A automatically converted into common stock at the
    lower of the conversion price then in effect or the offering
    price to the public.

Upon a “qualified public offering” meeting certain
    conditions, all Series B automatically converted into
    subordinated debt and common shares. One of the conditions was
    that the Company repurchase all of the warrants to purchase its
    common stock that were granted to the holders of the
    Series B. In a qualified public offering, the holders of
    the Series B received consideration equal to the greater of
    (A) what the holders of the Series B would have
    received if the Company were sold to a third party using the
    public offering price to compute the total sale price, which
    amount would have included the liquidation preference of the
    Series B plus an additional participation amount, as set
    forth in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, and
    (B) what the holders of the

Series B would have received if it converted upon the
    public offering at $15.00 per share. The Company’s
    initial public offering in December 2006 met the conditions for
    a qualified public offering and the holders of the Series B
    received upon conversion of their shares consideration
    consisting of subordinated three-year notes totaling $20,000,000
    in principal amount and the remainder in the form of the
    Company’s common stock valued at $16.50, the per share
    offering price to the public.

Because of the anti-dilution provision in the Series A and
    Series B, as a result of the initial public offering, the
    Company recorded a deemed dividend related to the beneficial
    conversion of the Series A and Series B of $63,000 and
    $18,204,000, respectively. The deemed dividend was recorded to
    give effect to the additional shares issued to the holders of
    Series A and Series B.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2004, two employees exercised 80,000 stock options and
    paid the exercise price with 12,000 shares of Series A.

Warrants

— In connection with the issuance of
    the Series B, the Company issued Series B Warrants to
    purchase, in the aggregate, $47,500,000 of the Company’s
    common stock at an equivalent per-share price of 50% of the fair
    value on the date of an initial public offering of common stock
    or the sale, merger or liquidation of the Company. The Company
    repurchased all of the Series B Warrants in connection with
    its initial public offering in December 2006 for $22,087,000.
    The Series B Warrants constituted freestanding derivatives
    that were accounted for as liabilities at fair value, which was
    estimated to be $14,644,000 at December 31, 2005. The
    Series B Warrants were a binary financial instrument with a
    fair value of either $23,750,000 if the Series B Warrants
    were exercised prior to their expiration or zero if the term of
    the Series B Warrants expired before they were exercised.
    At each balance sheet date, the fair value of the Series B
    Warrants was estimated by the Company by assessing the
    probability that the Series B Warrants would be exercised
    prior to their expiration. To calculate the estimated fair
    value, the determined probability percentage was multiplied by
    the total potential value of the Series B Warrants. A
    discount relating to the time value of money was applied to the
    estimated value if the Series B Warrants were not expected
    to be exercised within twelve months. As freestanding derivative
    instruments, changes in fair value of the Series B Warrants
    were recognized in earnings and reported as other income
    (expense). For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, the fair value of the Series B Warrants increased by
    $7,443,500, $745,000 and $615,000, respectively.

Notes Receivable From Issuances of
    Shares

— The Company has received notes from an
    individual in connection with this individual’s exercise of
    126,667 nonqualified stock options in March 2000, as well as the
    issuance of 166,667 shares of common stock in connection
    with professional services. This individual later became a
    member of the Company’s Board of Directors. The notes
    receivable had principal balances of $190,000 and $250,000,
    accruing interest at 1.68% and 1.52%, respectively, and were
    collateralized by 326,667 shares of the Company’s
    common stock. The loans were repaid in 2006.

During 2001, an employee exercised stock options and paid the
    exercise price and taxes with a nonrecourse note payable in a
    principal amount of $23,000 with a weighted-average interest
    rate of 4.76%.

The notes receivable are presented in the consolidated balance
    sheets as a decrease in stockholders’ equity. Interest
    income recognized from these notes totaled approximately $5,000,
    $8,000 and $10,000 during the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

    reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
    consist of the 20% of IPG Fibertech S.r.l., Italy

gross-up)

for each quarter that the U.S. Line of Credit is
    outstanding. The Company paid $71,000, $136,000 and $16,000 in

NET
    INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

For periods during which the Company had two classes of equity
    securities issued and outstanding, it followed EITF Issue

No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under
    FASB Statement No. 128

(“EITF

03-6”),

which established standards regarding the computation of net
    income (loss) per share by companies that have issued securities
    other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to
    participate in dividends and earnings of the company. EITF

03-6

requires earnings available to common stockholders for the
    period, after deduction of preferred stock accretion and deemed
    dividends related to beneficial conversion features, to be
    allocated between the common and convertible securities based on
    their respective rights to receive dividends. Basic net income
    (loss) per share is then calculated by dividing income

(loss) applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average
    number of shares outstanding. The Company’s preferred stock
    does not participate in losses, and therefore is not included in
    the computation of net loss per share, as applicable. EITF

03-6

does
    not require the presentation of basic and diluted net income
    (loss) per share for securities other than common stock;
    therefore, the following per share amounts only pertain to the
    Company’s common stock.

The Company calculates diluted net income (loss) per share under
    the if-converted method unless the conversion of the convertible
    preferred stock is anti-dilutive to basic net income (loss) per
    share. To the extent convertible preferred stock is
    anti-dilutive, the Company calculates diluted net income (loss)
    per share under the two-class method to include the effect of
    potential common shares.

The share count used to compute basic and diluted net income

    component supplier. Under the terms of the settlement, the
    Company entered into two supply agreements, pursuant to which
    (a) the Company agreed to sell to the component supplier
    certain products at discounted amounts and (b) the Company
    agreed to purchase from the component supplier certain
    percentages (but not fixed dollar amounts) of the Company’s
    external requirements, if any, for specified components for five
    years. The Company sold products to the supplier totaling
    $266,000, $119,000 and $189,000 for the years ended

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

In April 2005, the Company was sued for patent infringement
    relating to optical fiber. The plaintiff has made a complaint
    with unspecified damages. The Company answered the complaint on
    June 2, 2005, and filed a counterclaim, denying
    infringement and raising additional defenses. On the same day,
    the plaintiff in the case filed its complaint, the plaintiff
    requested that the United States Patent and Trademark Office
    reexamine the plaintiff’s patent, and the patent office
    granted that request. In view of the pending reexamination, the
    litigation was stayed until the conclusion of the patent office
    reexamination. The patent expires in January 2011. The Company
    believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously
    contest the claims after the patent office concludes the
    reexamination and the stay of litigation is lifted. As such, no
    amounts have been accrued in respect of this contingency.

In June 2006, another company filed a claim against the Company
    alleging infringement of a United States patent related to diode
    pumping of single mode core optical fibers. The plaintiff in
    this case seeks damages of over $20.0 million, treble
    damages and injunctive relief. In January 2007, the Company
    settled the claim. The settlement did not have a material impact
    on the Company’s financial statements.

On November 20, 2006, the Company was sued for patent
    infringement relating to certain unspecified fiber amplifier
    products. The plaintiff has made a complaint for damages of over
    $10 million, treble damages

for alleged willful infringement and injunctive relief. The

    vigorously contest the claims. As such, no amounts have been
    accrued in respect of this contingency.

During 2004, the Company completed audits performed by the
    Internal Revenue Service for the years ended 2001 and 2000. The
    completion of the audits allowed the Company to release
    $1,569,000 of accrued tax contingencies related to those years
    under audit. In addition, the benefit from (provision for)
    income taxes is different from that which would be obtained by
    applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
    income taxes due primarily to the valuation allowance that has
    been provided against the net operating losses that are not
    deemed to be recoverable. In 2006, the Company determined that
    it was more likely than not that a benefit would be realized
    from the domestic deferred tax assets and released $13,060,000
    related to the valuation allowance in addition to a favorable
    change of $4,620,000 resulting from the use of net operating
