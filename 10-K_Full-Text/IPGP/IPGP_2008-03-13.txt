PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Our
    Company

IPG Photonics Corporation (“IPG,” the
    “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we”,
    “us” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware
    in 1998. The Company is the leading developer and manufacturer
    of a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers for diverse
    applications in numerous markets. Fiber lasers are a new
    generation of lasers that combine the advantages of
    semiconductor diodes, such as long life and high efficiency,
    with the high amplification and precise beam qualities of
    specialty optical fibers to deliver superior performance,
    reliability and usability.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, advanced,
    communications and medical applications. We sell our products
    globally to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system
    integrators and end users. We market our products
    internationally primarily through our direct sales force and
    also through agreements with independent sales representatives
    and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States,
    Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, South Korea,
    India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture
    all key components used in our finished products, from
    semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber
    lasers and amplifiers. Our vertically integrated operations
    allow us to rapidly develop and integrate advanced products,
    protect our proprietary technology and ensure access to critical
    components while reducing manufacturing costs.

Industry
    Background

Traditional
    Laser Technologies

Since the laser was invented over 45 years ago, laser
    technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and
    products in various industries, including automotive, medical,
    research, consumer products,



electronics, semiconductors and communications. Lasers provide
    flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat
    various materials. They are widely used to transmit large
    volumes of data in optical communications systems, in various
    medical applications and in test and measurement systems. For a
    wide variety of applications, lasers provide superior
    performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser
    technologies.

Lasers emit an intense light beam that can be focused on a small
    area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or
    change their character. These properties are utilized in
    applications requiring very high-power densities, such as
    marking, printing, welding, cutting and other materials
    processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and
    inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light
    to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in
    medical and sensing applications. A laser works by converting
    electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy
    source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the
    energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles
    of light, called photons, at a particular wavelength. Lasers are
    used as an energy or light source for various applications. They
    are also incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other
    systems by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), system
    integrators and end users.

Historically,
    CO


gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser
    types used in materials processing and many other applications.
    They are named for the materials used to create the lasing
    action. A
    CO


laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled
    tube. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp, or
    diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The
    most common crystal lasers use YAG crystals infused with
    neodymium or ytterbium.

Introduction
    of Fiber Lasers

Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to
    pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth
    ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable
    in diameter to a human hair. The laser emission is created
    within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible cable. As
    a result of their different design and components, fiber lasers
    are more reliable, efficient, robust and portable, and easier to
    operate than traditional lasers. In addition, fiber lasers free
    the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high
    maintenance costs that are typical for conventional lasers.

Although low-power fiber lasers have existed for approximately
    four decades, their increased recent adoption has been driven
    primarily by our improvements in their performance, increases in
    output power levels and decreased costs. Over the last several
    years, technological improvements in optical components such as
    active fibers have increased their power capacities and resulted
    in overall performance improvements in fiber lasers. Fiber
    lasers offer output powers that exceed those of conventional
    lasers in many categories. Also, semiconductor diodes
    historically have represented the majority of the cost of fiber
    lasers. The high cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could
    not compete with conventional lasers on price and limited their
    use to high value-added applications. Recently, however,
    semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and reliable
    due, in part, to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode
    technology and increased production volumes. As a result, the
    average cost per watt of output power has decreased dramatically
    over the last decade. Because of these improvements, fiber
    lasers can now effectively compete with conventional lasers over
    a wide range of output powers and applications. As a pioneer in
    the development and commercialization of fiber lasers, we have
    contributed to many advancements in fiber laser technology and
    products.

Advantages
    of Fiber Lasers over Traditional Lasers

We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits
    that include:

•

Superior Performance.

Fiber lasers provide
    high beam quality over the entire power range. In most
    traditional laser solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to
    output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is
    virtually non-divergent over a wide power range, meaning the
    beam can be focused to achieve high levels of precision,
    increased power densities and greater distances over which
    processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and
    greater intensity of a fiber laser’s beam allow tasks to be
    accomplished rapidly and with lower-power units than comparable
    conventional lasers.



•

Lower Total Cost of Ownership.

Fiber lasers
    offer strong value to customers because of their generally lower
    total operating costs due to their lower required maintenance
    costs, high reliability and energy efficiency. The initial
    purchase price for fiber lasers is generally below that of YAG
    lasers and comparable to that of conventional
    CO


lasers. Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy
    2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped YAG lasers, 3
    times more efficiently than conventional
    CO


lasers and 15 to 30 times more efficiently than lamp-pumped YAG
    lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and
    place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal
    components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements
    compared to those of conventional lasers and lower or no
    maintenance costs.

•

Ease of Use.

Many features of fiber lasers
    make them easy to operate, maintain and integrate into
    laser-based systems and thus allow fiber lasers to provide a
    turnkey solution.

•

Compact Size and Portability.

Fiber lasers are
    typically smaller and lighter in weight than traditional lasers,
    saving valuable floor space. While conventional lasers are
    delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber lasers
    are more durable and able to perform in variable environments.

•

Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of
    Beam.

The design of fiber lasers generally
    provides a broad range of wavelength choices, allowing users to
    select the precise wavelength that best matches their
    application and materials.

Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many
    of the same components, such as semiconductor diodes and
    specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same
    advantages in the applications that require amplification.

Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there
    remain applications and processes where traditional laser
    technologies may provide superior performance with respect to
    particular features. For example, crystal lasers can provide
    higher peak power pulses and fiber lasers do not generate the
    deep ultraviolet light that is used for photolithography in many
    semiconductor applications. In addition,
    CO


lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many
    non-metallic materials, including plastics, and may be preferred
    for certain types of metal cutting because of their wavelength
    capabilities and other features.

Our
    Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key strengths and competitive advantages
    include the following:

    that utilize our optical fiber-based products. Many of our
    products are designed to be used as general purpose energy or
    light sources, making them useful in diverse applications and
    markets.

Our products are based on a common proprietary technology
    platform using many of the same core components, such as
    semiconductor diodes, specialty fibers, beam combiners,
    isolators, polarizers, splitters and modulators, which we
    configure to our customers’ specifications. Our engineers
    and scientists work closely with OEMs and end users to develop
    and customize our products for their needs. Because of our
    flexible and modular product architecture, we offer products in
    different configurations according to the desired application,
    including modules, rack-mounted units and tabletop units. Our
    engineers and other technical experts work directly with the
    customer in our applications centers to develop and configure
    the optimal solution for each customer’s manufacturing
    requirements. We also make complementary products and components
    that are used with our ultra-high power products, such as fiber
    couplers, beam delivery cables and chillers. In addition, we
    make marking systems for sale in India and China.

Lasers

Our laser products include low (1 to 99 watts), medium (100 to
    999 watts) and high (1,000 watts and above) output power lasers
    from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. These lasers either may be
    continuous wave (CW) or may be modulated at different rates. We
    offer several different types of lasers, which are defined by
    the type of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium,
    thulium and Raman. We also sell fiber pigtailed packaged diodes
    and fiber coupled direct diode laser systems that use
    semiconductor diodes rather than optical fibers as their gain
    medium. In addition, we offer high-energy pulsed lasers,
    multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers, single-polarization and
    single-frequency lasers, as well as other versions of our
    products.



We believe that we produce the highest power solid-state lasers
    in the industry. Our ytterbium fiber lasers can reach power
    levels over 40,000 watts. We also make single-mode output
    ytterbium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 3,000 watts
    and single-mode output erbium and thulium fiber lasers with
    power levels of up to 400 watts. Our compact, durable design and
    integrated fiber optic beam delivery allows us to offer
    versatile laser energy sources and simple laser integration for
    complex production processes without compromising quality, speed
    or power.

Amplifiers

Our amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to 500 watts
    of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We offer
    erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, commonly called EDFAs, Raman
    amplifiers and integrated communications systems that
    incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly
    deployed in broadband networks and dense wavelength division
    multiplexing, or DWDM, networks. We also offer ytterbium and
    thulium specialty fiber amplifiers and broadband light sources
    that are used in advanced applications. In addition, we sell
    single-frequency, linearly polarized and
    polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier products. As
    with our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer some of the
    highest output power levels and highest number of optical
    outputs in the industry. We believe our line of fiber amplifiers
    offers the best commercially available output power and
    performance.

Materials
    Processing

The most significant materials processing applications for fiber
    lasers are marking, printing, welding and cutting. Other
    applications include micromachining, surface treatment,
    drilling, soldering, annealing, rapid prototyping and
    laser-assisted machining.

Marking, Engraving and Printing
    Applications.

With the increasing need for source
    traceability, component identification and product tracking as a
    means of reducing product liability and preventing
    falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic
    production systems, industrial manufacturers are increasingly
    demanding marking systems capable of applying serialized
    alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto
    their manufactured components. Laser engraving is similar to
    marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to
    conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can
    mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as
    ceramic, glass and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without
    contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by
    engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a
    customer’s production process and do not subject the item
    being marked to mechanical stress.

In the semiconductor industry, lasers are typically used to mark
    wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry,
    lasers typically are used to mark electrical components such as
    contactors and relays, printed circuit boards and keyboards.
    With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the
    cost of laser marking has decreased. In the photovoltaic (solar
    panel) industry, pulsed lasers increasingly are used to remove
    materials and to scribe (cut) solar cells. The high beam
    quality, increased peak output powers, flexible fiber delivery
    and competitive price of fiber lasers have accelerated the
    adoption of fiber lasers in these low-power applications.



Historically, the printing industry has depended upon
    silver-halide films and chemicals to engrave printing plates.
    This chemical engraving process requires several time-consuming
    steps. In recent years, we have worked closely with OEMs in the
    printing industry to employ fiber lasers for alternative
    “computer-to-plate,” or CTP, processes. As a result,
    our ytterbium fiber lasers are now widely used for CTP printing,
    an environmentally friendly process that saves production time
    by writing directly to plates and greatly reduces chemical waste.

Welding Applications.

Laser welding offers
    several important advantages over conventional welding
    technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate, provides high
    process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high quality welds
    that generally require little or no post-processing machining.
    Parts can be accurately machined before welding because laser
    welding does not overly heat or otherwise damage or distort the
    material being processed. The high beam quality of our fiber
    lasers coupled with high CW power offers deep penetration
    welding as well as shallow conduction mode welding. High
    modulation frequencies offer very high throughput in pulsed
    applications. In addition, fiber lasers can be focused to a
    small spot with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote
    welding “on the fly,” a flexible method of
    three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is positioned
    by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped
    with fiber lasers are used for welding door panels and the
    multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the entire auto body
    frame. Typically, mid- to high-power ytterbium fiber lasers are
    used in welding applications.

Cutting Applications.

Laser-based cutting
    technology has several advantages compared to alternative
    technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible, highly precise
    and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or
    three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be programmed
    to process many different kinds of materials such as steel,
    aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at various
    thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact process
    that is easy to integrate into an automated production line and
    is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell low, mid
    and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser cutting. The
    operating wavelength, multi-kilowatt power, high beam quality,
    wide operating power range, power stability and small spot size
    are some of the qualities offered by fiber lasers for most
    cutting applications.

Emerging Technologies and
    Applications.

Robotic production methods are
    increasing in use, driven by their lower production costs,
    flexibility and consistency. Fiber lasers complement the
    capabilities of robots with their flexible fiber delivery,
    high-power beam and low beam divergence. In 2007, fiber lasers
    were successfully integrated with robotic systems in
    applications such as tailored blanks. Visible lasers are also an
    emerging technology. Visible lasers can be used in materials
    processing applications such as ceramic processing, holography
    and micro-electronics.

Advanced
    Applications

Our fiber lasers and amplifiers are utilized by commercial firms
    and by academic and government institutions worldwide for
    manufacturing of commercial systems and for research in advanced
    technologies and products. These markets may use specialty
    products developed by us or commercial versions of our products.

Obstacle Warning.

Our products are used aboard
    aircraft for obstacle warning and

3-dimensional

mapping of earth surfaces.

Special Projects.

Due to the high power,
    compactness, performance, portability, ruggedness and electrical
    efficiency of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, we sell our
    commercial products for government research and projects. These
    include materials testing, ordnance destruction, coherent beam
    combining, advanced communications and research.

Research and Development.

Our products are
    used in a variety of applications for research and development
    by scientists and industrial researchers. In addition, our
    lasers and amplifiers are used to design, test and characterize
    components and systems in a variety of markets and applications.

Optical Pumping and Harmonic
    Generation.

Several types of our lasers are used
    to optically pump other solid-state lasers and for harmonic
    generation and parametric converters to support research in
    sensing,



medical and other scientific research in the infrared and
    visible wavelength domains. Our lasers are used as a power
    source for these other lasers. Green visible lasers are used to
    pump titanium sapphire lasers. Visible lasers can be used in
    optical displays, planetariums and light shows.

Optical Communication.

We provide high-power
    EDFAs and ytterbium fiber amplifiers for deployment in both
    point-to-point and point-to-multipoint free space optical
    networks. These networks permit communications between two or
    more points on land or in the sky without the use of fiber optic
    lines or radio or microwaves.

Remote Sensing.

Our products are used in light
    detection and ranging, also called LIDAR, a laser technique for
    remote sensing. Optical fiber can be used as a sensor for
    measuring changes in temperature, pressure and gas concentration
    in oil wells, atmospheric and pollution measurements and seismic
    exploration.

Communications

We design and manufacture a DWDM transport system with varying
    output power and wavelengths and a full range of fiber
    amplifiers and Raman pump lasers that enhance data transmission
    in broadband access and DWDM optical networks. We are leveraging
    our high-power diode and fiber technology through the
    qualification and sale of high-value integrated solutions for
    network suppliers.

DWDM.

DWDM is a technology that expands the
    capacity of optical networks, allowing service providers to
    extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating
    and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a
    broad range of high-power products for DWDM applications
    including EDFAs and Raman lasers. We provide a DWDM transport
    system that offers service providers and private network
    operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution scalable
    from 8 to 40 channels that operates at 10 gibabits per second
    per channel.

Broadband Access.

The delivery to subscribers
    of television programming and Internet-based information and
    communication services is converging, driven by advances in IP
    technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive
    environment. Fiber optic lines offer connection speeds of up to
    50 megabits per second, or 50 times faster than digital
    subscriber lines (DSL) or cable links. We offer a series of
    specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable TV nodes and transmitters
    that support different types of passive optical network
    architectures, enabling high speed data, voice, video on demand
    and high definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to
    32 ports, which allows service providers to support a high
    number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power
    consumption and network cost. End users for our products include
    communications network operators for video wavelength division
    multiplexing overlay, as well as cable and multiple service
    operators for video signal and hybrid fiber coaxial cable.

Medical

We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that
    incorporate our products into their medical laser systems.
    Continuous wave and pulsed lasers from 1 to 150 watts and diode
    laser systems can be used in medical and biomedical
    applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include
    skin rejuvenation, skin resurfacing and stretch mark removal.
    Purchasers use our diode lasers in urological applications and
    dental procedures. Fiber lasers have the ability to fine-tune
    optical penetration depth and absorption characteristics and can
    be used for ear, nose and throat, urology, gynecology and other
    surgical procedures. Visible lasers can be used in prostate,
    ophthalmic and dental procedures in addition to photodynamic
    therapies.

Technology

Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform
    that we have developed and refined since our formation. The
    following technologies are key elements in our products.

Specialty
    Optical Fibers

We have extensive expertise in the disciplines and techniques
    that form the basis for the multi-clad active and passive
    optical fibers used in our products. Active optical fibers form
    the laser cavity or gain medium in



which lasing or amplification of light occurs in our products.
    Passive optical fibers deliver the optical energy created in our
    products. Our active fibers consist of an inner core that is
    infused with the appropriate rare earth ion, such as ytterbium,
    erbium or thulium, and outer cores of un-doped glass having
    different indices of refraction. We believe that our large
    portfolio of specialty active and passive optical fibers has a
    number of advantages as compared to commercially available
    optical fibers. These include higher concentrations of rare
    earth ions, fibers that will not degrade at the high power
    levels over the useful life of the product, high lasing
    efficiency, ability to withstand high optical energies and
    temperatures and scalable side-pumping capability. Our ability
    to quickly optimize our proprietary active and passive optical
    fibers allows us to provide a variety of innovative fiber
    devices in customizable configurations.

Semiconductor
    Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies

Another key element of our technology platform is that we use
    multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather
    than diode bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that
    multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and
    reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode
    bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability.
    Single-emitter diodes have substantially reduced cooling
    requirements and have estimated lifetimes of more than
    200,000 hours at high operating currents, compared to
    typical lifetimes of 10,000 to 20,000 hours for diode bars.

We developed advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow
    alumina indium gallium arsenide wafers for our diodes. This
    method yields high-quality optoelectronic material for
    low-defect density and high uniformity of optoelectronic
    parameters. In addition, we have developed numerous proprietary
    wafer processes and testing and qualification procedures in
    order to create a high energy output in a reliable and
    high-power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically sealed
    pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an optical
    fiber output. Characteristics such as the ability of the package
    to dissipate heat produced by the diode and withstand vibration,
    shock, high temperature, humidity and other environmental
    conditions are critical to the reliability and efficiency of the
    products.

Side
    Pumping of Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a
    greater number of multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes
    with our active optical fibers that are used in all of our
    products. A key element of this technology is that we pump our
    fiber lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core.
    We splice our specialty active optical fibers with other optical
    components and package them in a sealed box, which we call a
    fiber block. The fiber blocks are compact and eliminate the risk
    of contamination or misalignment due to mechanical vibrations
    and shocks as well as temperature or humidity variations. Our
    design is scalable and modular, permitting us to make products
    with high output power by coupling a large number of diodes with
    fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and serially.

High-Stress
    Testing

We employ high-stress techniques in testing components and final
    products that help increase reliability and accelerate product
    development. For example, we test all of our diodes with high
    current and temperatures to accelerate aging. We also have built
    a large database of diode test results that allows us to predict
    the estimated lifetime of our diodes. This testing allows us to
    eliminate defective diodes prior to further assembly and thus
    increase reliability.

Customers

We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and
    end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the
    in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into
    their own systems. We have hundreds of customers worldwide. Our
    end markets include materials processing (comprised of general
    manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, consumer
    products, semiconductor and electronics customers), advanced
    applications (comprised of commercial companies, universities,
    research entities and government entities), communications
    (comprised of system integrators, utilities and municipalities)
    and



medical (medical laser systems manufacturers) . We believe that
    our customer and end market diversification minimizes dependence
    on any single industry or group of customers.

Backlog

At December 31, 2007, our backlog of orders scheduled for
    shipment (generally within one year) was approximately
    $72.6 million compared to $51.8 million at
    December 31, 2006. Orders used to compute backlog are
    generally cancelable without substantial penalties.
    Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by us has not
    been significant. We manage the risk of cancellation by
    establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that
    generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials
    and development costs incurred prior to the order being
    cancelled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many
    factors including, but not limited to, the customer’s
    requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding
    orders with the customer and our ability to quickly convert the
    cancelled order to another sale.

The Company anticipates shipping a substantial majority of the
    present backlog during fiscal year 2008. However, the
    Company’s backlog at any given date is not necessarily
    indicative of actual sales for any future period.

Sales,
    Marketing and Support

We market our products internationally primarily through our
    direct sales force and also through agreements with independent
    sales representatives and distributors. We have sales offices in
    the United States, Germany, Russia, Italy, China, Japan, South
    Korea, India and the United Kingdom. Our independent sales
    representatives and distributors are located in the United
    States, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Mexico and other parts of the
    world. Only one of these arrangements is on an exclusive basis.
    Foreign sales to customers are generally priced in local
    currencies and are therefore subject to currency exchange
    fluctuations.

We maintain a customer support and field service staff in our
    major markets within the United States, Canada, Europe, Russia,
    China, Japan, India and South Korea. We work closely with
    customers, customer groups and independent representatives to
    service equipment, train customers to use our products and
    explore



additional applications for our technologies. We typically
    repair products at our facilities or at customer sites. We plan
    to expand our support and field service, particularly in
    locations where customer concentration or volume requires local
    service capabilities.

We typically provide one to three-year parts and service
    warranties on our lasers and amplifiers. Most of our sales
    offices provide support to customers in their respective
    geographic areas. Warranty reserves have generally been
    sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement
    costs.

Manufacturing

Vertical integration is one of our core business strategies
    through which we control our proprietary processes and
    technologies as well as the supply of key components and
    assemblies. We believe that our vertically integrated business
    model gives us the following advantages:

•

maintaining a technological lead over competitors;

•

reducing component and final product costs as volumes increase;

•

ensuring access to critical components, enabling us to better
    meet customer demands;

•

controlling performance, quality and consistency; and

•

enabling rapid development and deployment of new products and
    technologies.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include
    optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor
    wafer growth, diode processing and packaging, specialty optical
    component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly
    for different power units, software and electronics development,
    final assembly, as well as testing, tool manufacturing and
    automated production systems. In 2007, we added additional
    production capabilities, including three multi-wafer growth
    reactors, diode test stations, fiber pre-form and fiber drawing
    equipment, low, mid and high-power production and testing, in
    order to increase our capacity as well as reduce the risks
    associated with our production process.

We operate our own semiconductor foundry for the production of
    the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that
    are used as the light source in each device we make. We also
    process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. Since
    pump diodes represent a significant component cost of the final
    laser or amplifier, we have chosen to develop internal
    manufacturing capabilities for diodes. As a result of our high
    volume production levels of pump diodes, proprietary processes
    and use of limited chip designs, we have been able to increase
    yields, lower component costs and assure high quality. We also
    design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test
    instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly
    tools and machines.

We developed these proprietary components, manufacturing tools,
    equipment and techniques over many years in an effort to address
    the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of
    fiber laser technology and to provide products that
    differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that the
    proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment,
    techniques and software utilized in all of our product lines
    provide extensive barriers to potential competitors. Generally,
    we do not sell our proprietary components to third parties,
    except that in 2008, we started selling our diodes to the
    merchant market. Using our technology platform, we configure
    standard products based upon each customer’s
    specifications. Through our vertically integrated manufacturing
    operations, we can develop, test and produce new products and
    configurations with higher performance and reliability and in
    less time than by working with external vendors. We have
    developed proprietary testing methodologies that allow us to
    develop higher power components and products in short periods of
    time, enable us to introduce products to the market more
    quickly, capitalize on new opportunities and provide superior
    service to our customers.

Our in-house manufacturing generally includes only those
    operations and components that are critical to the protection of
    our intellectual property, the reduction of our costs or the
    achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase
    from vendors common as well as specialized mechanical,
    electrical and optical parts and raw materials, such as printed
    circuit boards, wafer substrates and various optical components.



Research
    and Development

We have extensive research and development experience in laser
    materials, fiber and optoelectronic components. We have
    assembled a team of scientists and engineers with specialized
    experience and extensive knowledge in fiber lasers and
    amplifiers, critical components, testing and manufacturing
    process design.

We focus our research and development efforts on designing and
    introducing new and improved standard and customized products
    and the mass production of components that go into our products.
    In addition to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we
    have core competencies in high-power multi-mode semiconductor
    laser diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive
    optical fibers, high-performance optical components, fiber gain
    blocks and fiber modules, as well as splicing and combining
    techniques and high-stress test methods. Our research and
    development efforts are aided by our vertical integration and
    our proprietary high-stress testing techniques that result in
    accelerated development cycles. The strategy of developing our
    proprietary components has allowed us to leverage our optical
    experience and large volume requirements to lower the cost of
    our products. We concentrate our research and development
    efforts on advancements in performance as well as capacity to
    hold and produce higher optical power levels.

Our research and development efforts are also directed at
    expanding our product line by increasing power levels, improving
    beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing the size of
    our products and lowering the cost per watt. We also are engaged
    in research projects to expand the spectral range of products
    that we offer. Our team of experienced scientists and engineers
    work closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce
    custom products that address specific applications and
    performance requirements.

We incurred research and development costs of approximately
    $9.5 million in 2007, $6.5 million in 2006 and
    $5.8 million in 2005. We plan to continue our commitment to
    research and development and to introduce new products, systems
    and complementary products that would allow us to maintain our
    competitive position. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Results of
    Operations.”

Intellectual
    Property

We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through
    U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade
    secrets, and to seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and
    trademark protection of our products and processes where
    appropriate. Historically, we relied primarily on trade secrets,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    relating to our product development and manufacturing
    activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary
    information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into
    agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and
    the assignment to us of rights to inventions that they make
    while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure
    agreements with our consultants and suppliers to protect
    confidential information delivered to them. We believe that our
    vertical integration, including our long experience in making a
    wide range of specialty and high-power capacity components, as
    well as our technology platform make it difficult for others to
    reverse engineer our products.

We have increased our efforts to expand our patent portfolio. In
    February 2008, we purchased a portfolio of photonics patents
    from British Telecommunications plc that included approximately
    100 U.S. patents and over 400 foreign counterparts in the
    fields of optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, semiconductor
    devices, integrated optics, fiber gratings, high-speed systems
    and optical networking. In addition, as of March 1, 2008,
    we have 15 patent applications filed and pending with the
    U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In 2007, we were issued a
    patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to
    optical fibers.

Intellectual property rights, including those that we own and
    those of others, involve significant risks. See Item 1A,
    “Risk Factors-Our inability to Protect Our Intellectual
    Property and Proprietary Technologies Could Result in the
    Unauthorized Use of Our Technologies by Third Parties, Hurt Our
    Competitive Position and Adversely Affect Our Operating
    Results.”

    with fiber laser makers including The Furukawa Electric Co.,
    Ltd., Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi
    Unitek Corporation, MPB Communications Inc., Rofin-Sinar
    Technologies, Inc., SPI Lasers plc and JDS Uniphase Corporation
    for low

and/or

mid-power lasers. We believe that we compete favorably with
    other makers of fiber lasers on price, service, installed base
    and performance with respect to low and mid-power fiber lasers.
    While we are currently a technology and price leader in fiber
    lasers and have a large share of fiber laser sales as compared
    to competitors that make fiber lasers, we expect competition
    from established laser makers that may have started or may start
    programs to develop and sell fiber lasers or alternative new
    solid state laser technologies. Because many of the components
    required to develop and produce low-power fiber lasers are
    becoming increasingly available, barriers to entry are
    relatively low and we expect new competitive products to be
    introduced. Several established laser makers, including Trumpf
    Inc., Newport Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. and
    others, have recently introduced fiber lasers or have announced
    plans to develop fiber-based lasers, each of which would compete
    with our products. Many of the conventional laser companies are
    larger and have substantially greater financial, managerial and
    technical resources, more extensive distribution and service
    networks, greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger
    installed customer bases than we do. We also compete in the
    materials processing, medical and advanced applications markets
    with end users who produce their own solid-state and gas lasers
    as well as with manufacturers of non-laser methods and tools,
    such as resistance welding and cutting dies in the materials
    processing market and scalpels in the medical market.

In the communications market, our principal competitors are
    manufacturers of mid-power fiber amplifiers and DWDM systems,
    such as Avanex Corporation, Bookham Inc., the Scientific-Atlanta
    division of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Scientific-Atlanta), Emcore
    Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation and MPB Communications
    Inc. We believe that we compete favorably with other high-power
    fiber amplifier producers with respect to price, product
    performance and output power. The fiber amplifier market is more
    established than the fiber laser market and technological change
    has not occurred as rapidly as it has in the case of fiber
    lasers. Many of our competitors in this market are larger than
    we are and have substantially greater financial, managerial and
    technical resources, more extensive distribution and service
    networks, greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger
    installed customer bases than we do.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    1,300 full-time employees, including approximately
    80 in research and development, 1,020 in manufacturing
    operations, 70 in sales, service and marketing, and 130 in
    general and administrative functions. Of our total full-time
    employees at our principal facilities,



approximately 380 were in the United States, 470 were in
    Germany, 320 were in Russia and 50 were in China. We have never
    experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees is subject
    to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our
    current relations with our employees are good.

Government
    Regulation

Regulatory
    Compliance

The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the
    United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products
    under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for
    Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration. The same classification system is applied
    in the European markets. Safety rules are formulated with
    “Deutsche Industrie Norm” (i.e., German Industrial
    Standards) or ISO standards, which are internationally
    harmonized. CDRH regulations generally require a
    self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer
    must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product
    incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and
    purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product
    safety and design features and informational requirements. Our
    products applications can result in injury to human tissue if
    directed at an individual or otherwise misused. The CDRH is
    empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of
    their requirements. We believe that our products are in material
    compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the
    manufacture of laser devices.

Environmental
    Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws governing the environment, including those
    relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product
    composition and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous
    and toxic materials. We believe that our operations are in
    material compliance with applicable environmental protection
    laws and regulations.

Although we believe that our safety procedures for using,
    handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with
    the standards required by federal and state laws and
    regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of
    accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the
    event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be
    liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of
    our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our
    business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The factors described below are the principal risks that
    could materially adversely affect our operating results and
    financial condition. Other factors may exist that we do not
    consider significant based on information that is currently
    available. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we
    cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they
    may affect us.

Our
    future growth depends upon our ability to penetrate new
    applications for fiber lasers and increase our market share in
    existing applications.

Our future growth will depend on our ability to generate sales
    of fiber lasers in applications where traditional lasers, such
    as
    CO


and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers, have been used or in
    new and developing markets and applications for lasers where
    they have not been used previously. To date, a significant
    portion of our revenue growth has been derived from sales of
    fiber lasers primarily for applications where
    CO




and YAG lasers historically have been used. In order to increase
    market demand for our fiber laser products, we will need to
    devote substantial resources to:

•

demonstrate the effectiveness of fiber lasers in new
    applications;

•

increase our direct and indirect sales efforts;

•

extend our product line to address new applications for our
    products;

•

continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and enhance our
    competitive position; and

•

effectively service and support our installed product base.

If we are unable to implement our strategy to develop new
    applications for our products, our revenues, operating results
    and financial condition could be adversely affected. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our
    business strategy. In addition, our newly developed or enhanced
    products may not achieve market acceptance or may be rendered
    obsolete or less competitive by the introduction of new products
    by other companies.

If
    fiber lasers do not achieve broader market acceptance or if
    market penetration occurs more slowly than we expect, prospects
    for our growth and profitability may be negatively
    impacted.

The fiber laser market is relatively new when compared to the
    conventional laser market and our future success depends on the
    development and broader market acceptance of fiber lasers.
    Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt fiber lasers as an
    alternative to traditional lasers, such as
    CO


and YAG, and non-laser methods, such as mechanical tools. Such
    potential customers may have substantial investments and
    know-how related to their existing laser and non-laser
    technologies, and may perceive risks relating to the
    reliability, quality, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fiber
    lasers when compared to other laser or non-laser technologies
    available in the market. Many of our target markets, such as the
    automotive, machine tool and other manufacturing, communications
    and medical industries, have historically adopted new
    technologies slowly. These markets often require long test and
    qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes
    before adopting new technologies. As a result, we may expend
    significant resources and time to qualify our products for a new
    customer application, and we cannot assure that our products
    will be qualified or approved for such markets. If acceptance of
    fiber laser technology, and of our fiber lasers in particular,
    does not continue to grow within the markets that we serve, then
    the opportunities to increase our revenues and profitability may
    be severely limited.

We may
    not be able to effectively manage our growth and we may need to
    incur significant costs to address the operational requirements
    related to our growth, either of which could harm our business
    and operating results.

We have been experiencing a period of significant growth and
    expansion, both in the United States and internationally, which
    has required, and will continue to require, increased efforts of
    our management and other resources. Our recent and anticipated
    growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place,
    significant strain on our research and development, sales and
    marketing, operational and administrative resources. To manage
    our growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational
    and financial systems, expand, train and manage our employees
    and manage our working capital requirements. For example, we
    must implement new modules of our management information system,
    hire and train new sales representatives, service and
    application personnel, and expand our supply chain management
    and quality control operations. This may require substantial
    managerial and financial resources, and our efforts in this
    regard may not be successful. If we fail to adequately manage
    our expected growth, or to improve our operational, financial
    and management information systems, or fail to effectively
    motivate or manage our new and future employees, the quality of
    our products and the management of our operations could suffer
    and our operating results could be adversely affected.



Our
    vertically integrated business results in high levels of fixed
    costs and inventory levels that may adversely impact our gross
    profits and our operating results in the event that demand for
    our products declines or we maintain excess inventory
    levels.

We have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated
    business model, including the fact that approximately 76% of our
    over 1,300 employees as of December 31, 2007 were
    employed in our manufacturing operations. We cannot adjust these
    fixed costs quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market
    conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of net sales, is greatly impacted by our sales
    volume, the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing
    overhead expenses and manufacturing yields. In addition, because
    we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and design and
    manufacture our key specialty components, insufficient demand
    for our products may subject us to the risks of high inventory
    carrying costs and increased inventory obsolescence. If we
    expand capacity and production levels too quickly in relation to
    expected demand, we may need to record write-downs for excess or
    obsolete inventory. Because we are vertically integrated, the
    rate at which we turn inventory has historically been low when
    compared to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change
    significantly in the future and believe that we will have to
    maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our
    cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a
    significant amount of working capital invested in inventory and
    changes in our level of inventory to lead to an increase in cash
    generated from our operations when inventory is sold or a
    decrease in cash generated from our operations at times when the
    amount of inventory increases. We may be required to write-down
    inventory costs in the future as we have done in the past, and
    the high inventory costs may have an adverse effect on our gross
    profits and our operating results.

We may
    experience lower than expected manufacturing yields, which would
    adversely affect our gross margins.

The manufacture of semiconductor diodes and the packaging of
    them is a highly complex process. Manufacturers often encounter
    difficulties in achieving acceptable product yields from diode
    and packaging operations. We have from time to time experienced
    lower than anticipated manufacturing yields for our diodes and
    packaged diodes. This occurs during the production of new
    designs and the installation and

start-up

of
    new process technologies. If we do not achieve planned yields,
    our product costs could increase resulting in lower gross
    margins, and key component availability would decrease.

Our
    capacity expansion plans for manufacturing and operations may
    not be appropriate for future levels of demand and may adversely
    affect our gross margins.

In response to an increase in demand for our fiber lasers, we
    started adding substantial manufacturing capacity at our
    facilities in the United States, Germany and Russia beginning in
    early 2005, and we are continuing to expand our capacity
    further. A significant portion of our manufacturing facilities
    and production equipment, such as our semiconductor production
    and processing equipment, diode packaging equipment and diode
    burn-in stations, are special- purpose in nature and cannot be
    adapted easily to make other products. If the demand for fiber
    lasers or amplifiers does not increase from current levels, we
    may have significant excess manufacturing capacity, which could
    in turn adversely affect our gross margins. If demand for fiber
    lasers or amplifiers increases substantially more than we
    anticipate, our manufacturing capacity may not be adequate to
    meet the increased customer demand. As a result, we might not be
    able to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, which could
    adversely affect our customer relationships and operating
    results. Moreover, our efforts to increase our production
    capacity may not succeed in enabling us to manufacture the
    required quantities of our products in a timely manner or at
    gross profit margins that we have achieved in the past. As a
    result, the profit margins we ultimately achieve on sales of
    fiber lasers and amplifiers may be lower than our historical
    profit margins.

To maintain our competitive position as the leading developer
    and manufacturer of fiber lasers and to meet anticipated
    increased demand for our products, we intend to invest
    significantly in the expansion of our manufacturing and
    operations throughout the world. We currently anticipate
    expanding our manufacturing facilities in the United States,
    Germany and Russia in the next twelve months and to expand the
    number and scope of our applications centers, which complement
    our sales activities. We incurred in the past and will



incur significant costs associated with the acquisition,
    build-out and preparation of these new facilities. In total, we
    had $34 million in capital expenditures in 2007 and we
    expect our capital expenditures to be approximately
    $33 million in 2008 in connection with planned expansion.
    In connection with these projects, we may incur cost overruns,
    construction delays, labor difficulties or regulatory issues
    which could cause our capital expenditures to be higher than
    what we currently anticipate, possibly by a material amount,
    which would in turn adversely impact our operating results. Any
    delay in the completion of these projects could also cause us to
    have insufficient capacity to meet customer demand or could
    require us to procure materials or components from third-party
    suppliers, either of which could adversely impact our operating
    results. Moreover, we may experience higher costs due to yield
    loss, production inefficiencies and equipment problems until any
    operational issues associated with the opening of new
    manufacturing facilities are resolved.

Because
    we lack long-term purchase commitments from our customers, our
    sales can be difficult to predict, which could lead to excess or
    obsolete inventory and adversely affect our operating
    results.

We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or
    amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase
    orders and shipment schedules and, in some cases, orders may be
    cancelled or delayed without significant penalty. As a result,
    it is difficult to forecast our revenues and to determine the
    appropriate levels of inventory required to meet future demand.
    In addition, due to the absence of long-term volume purchase
    agreements, we forecast our revenues and plan our production and
    inventory levels based upon the demand forecasts of our OEM
    customers, end users, and distributors, which are highly
    unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. This could lead
    to increased inventory levels and increased carrying costs and
    risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to unanticipated
    reductions in purchases by our customers. In this regard, we
    recorded provisions for inventory totaling $2.5 million,
    $1.0 million and $1.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. These provisions were recorded as a result of
    changes in market prices of certain components, the value of
    those inventories that was realizable through finished product
    sales and uncertainties related to the recoverability of the
    value of inventories due to technological changes and excess
    quantities. If our OEM customers, end users or distributors fail
    to accurately forecast the demand for our products, fail to
    accurately forecast the timing of such demand, or are unable to
    consistently negotiate acceptable purchase order terms with
    customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

We are
    subject to litigation alleging that we are infringing
    third-party intellectual property rights. Intellectual property
    claims could result in costly litigation and harm our
    business.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving
    intellectual property rights in many technology-based
    industries, including our own. We face risks and uncertainties
    in connection with such litigation, including the risk that
    patents issued to others may harm our ability to do business;
    that there could be existing patents of which we are unaware
    that could be pertinent to our business; and that it is not
    possible for us to know whether there are patent applications
    pending that our products might infringe upon, since patent
    applications often are not disclosed until a patent is issued or
    published. Moreover, the frequency with which new patents are
    granted and the diversity of jurisdictions in which they are
    granted make it impractical and expensive for us to monitor all
    patents that may be relevant to our business.

From time to time, we have been notified of allegations and
    claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual
    property rights owned by third parties. In 2007, we settled two
    patent infringement lawsuits filed against us. We are presently
    defending two patent infringement lawsuits. In November 2006,
    IMRA America, Inc. filed an action against us alleging that
    certain products we produce, including but not limited to our
    continuous wave and pulsed fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers,
    which account for a significant portion of our revenues,
    infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA America.
    IMRA America alleges willful infringement, and seeks damages of
    at least $10 million, treble damages and injunctive relief.
    IMRA America also alleges inducement of infringement and
    contributory infringement. This lawsuit concerns products made,
    used, sold or offered for sale in or imported into the United
    States and therefore the lawsuit affects products that account
    for a substantial portion of our revenues. This lawsuit does not
    affect revenues that are derived from products that are not
    made, used, sold or offered for sale in or imported into the
    United States. The case



is in the discovery stage and trial has been set for
    August 5, 2008. We petitioned the U.S. Patent and
    Trademark Office (the “US PTO”) to re-examine the
    patent based on several prior art references. The US PTO is
    considering our re-examination request. Should the US PTO
    initiate re-examination, several outcomes are possible,
    including the cancellation of one or more of the current claims
    of the patent, confirmation of one or more of the current claims
    of the patent, amendment of one or more of the current claims of
    the patent,

and/or

addition of one or more new claims that do not enlarge the
    overall scope of the patent claims. An adverse outcome in the US
    PTO re-examination could have an adverse impact on our defenses
    in our litigation with IMRA America.

In February 2008, CardioFocus Inc. filed an action against us
    alleging that our erbium and thulium fiber lasers infringe one
    patent allegedly owned by CardioFocus and seeks unspecified
    damages, treble damages and attorneys’ fees for alleged
    willful infringement. The plaintiff also alleges inducement of
    infringement. The patent claims generally relate to a system for
    transmitting laser energy via an optical fiber to a surgical
    site. The patent expired in April 2007. We intend to file an
    answer to the complaint raising several defenses. Although we
    intend to vigorously contest the claims against us, we cannot
    predict the outcome of the proceeding.

IMRA America and other parties have notified us that they
    believe certain of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, or the use
    of these products, infringe the respective parties’
    patents. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
    amicably dispose of our pending litigation with IMRA America or
    CardioFocus, claims or other allegations made against us and
    claims that may be asserted in the future. The outcome of any
    litigation, including the pending litigation, is uncertain, as
    is the outcome of our request for re-examination of the IMRA
    America patent. Even if we ultimately are successful on the
    merits of any such litigation or re-examination, legal and
    administrative proceedings related to intellectual property are
    typically expensive and time-consuming, generate negative
    publicity and divert financial and managerial resources. Some
    litigants against us may have greater financial resources and
    may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual
    property litigation more easily than we can.

If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation
    brought against us, including the lawsuits brought by IMRA
    America and Cardio Focus, it could affect our ability to sell
    our products and materially harm our business, financial
    condition and results of operations. These developments could
    adversely affect our ability to compete for customers and
    increase our revenues. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases
    often seek, and sometimes obtain, injunctive relief.
    Intellectual property litigation commenced against us, including
    the lawsuits brought by IMRA America and CardioFocus that we are
    presently defending, could force us to take actions that could
    be harmful to our business, competitive position, results of
    operations and financial condition, including the following:

•

stop selling our products or using the technology that contains
    the allegedly infringing intellectual property;

•

pay actual monetary damages, royalties, lost profits or
    increased damages and the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees,
    which individually or in the aggregate may be substantial;

•

attempt to obtain a license to use the relevant intellectual
    property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at
    all; and

•

attempt to redesign the products that allegedly infringed upon
    intellectual property of others, which may be costly or
    impractical.

In addition, intellectual property lawsuits can be brought by
    third parties against OEMs and end users that incorporate our
    products into their systems or processes. In some cases, we
    indemnify OEMs against third-party infringement claims relating
    to our products and we often make representations affirming,
    among other things, that our products do not infringe on the
    intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may
    incur liabilities in connection with lawsuits against our
    customers. Any such lawsuits, whether or not they have merit,
    could be time-consuming to defend, damage our reputation or
    result in substantial and unanticipated costs.



Our
    inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
    technologies could result in the unauthorized use of our
    technologies by third parties, hurt our competitive position and
    adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on patents, trade secret laws, contractual agreements,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    to protect our products, product development and manufacturing
    activities from unauthorized copying by third parties. While we
    recently acquired a patent portfolio, our patents do not cover
    all of our technologies, products and product components and may
    not prevent third parties from unauthorized copying of our
    technologies, products and product components. We seek to
    protect our proprietary technology under laws affording
    protection for trade secrets. We also seek to protect our trade
    secrets and proprietary information, in part, by requiring
    employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance
    of confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions
    made by them while employed by us. We have significant
    international operations and we are subject to foreign laws
    which differ in many respects from U.S. laws. Policing
    unauthorized use of our trade secret technologies throughout the
    world and proving misappropriation of our technologies are
    particularly difficult, especially due to the number of our
    employees and operations in numerous foreign countries. The
    steps that we take to acquire ownership of our employees’
    inventions and trade secrets in foreign countries may not have
    been effective under all such local laws, which could expose us
    to potential claims or the inability to protect intellectual
    property developed by our employees. Furthermore, any changes
    in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade secret and other
    intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate
    may adversely affect our ability to enforce our trade secret and
    intellectual property positions. Costly and time-consuming
    litigation could be necessary to determine the scope of our
    confidential information and trade secret protection. We also
    enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and
    other suppliers to protect our confidential information that we
    deliver to them. However, there can be no assurance that our
    confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that we will be
    able to effectively enforce them or that we will have adequate
    remedies for any breach.

Given our reliance on trade secret laws, others may
    independently develop similar or alternative technologies or
    duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we
    have made. Therefore, our intellectual property efforts may be
    insufficient to maintain our competitive advantage or to stop
    other parties from commercializing similar products or
    technologies. Many countries outside of the United States afford
    little or no protection to trade secrets and other intellectual
    property rights. Intellectual property litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that we
    will have the resources to fully enforce our rights. If we are
    unable to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our
    intellectual property rights, or the independent development or
    design of similar technologies, our competitive position and
    operating results could suffer.

Future
    downturns in the global economy, particularly in the materials
    processing and communications markets, could have a material
    adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by
    our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials
    processing and communications markets. Approximately 82% of our
    revenues in 2007 were in these two markets. Although these
    industries are broad, they are cyclical and have historically
    experienced sudden and severe downturns and periods of
    oversupply, resulting in significantly reduced demand for
    capital equipment, including the products that we manufacture
    and market. For the foreseeable future, our operations will
    continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in
    these markets, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for their
    products or services. Decreased demand for products and services
    from customers in these industries during an economic downturn
    may lead to decreased demand for our products, which would
    reduce our sales or sales growth rate.

We
    depend upon internal production and on outside single or
    limited-source suppliers for many of our key components and raw
    materials. Any interruption in the supply of these key
    components and raw materials could adversely affect our results
    of operations.

We rely exclusively on our own production capabilities to
    manufacture certain of our key components, such as semiconductor
    diodes, specialty optical fibers and optical components. We do
    not have redundant



production lines for some of our components, such as our diodes
    and some other components, which are made at a single
    manufacturing facility. These may not be readily available from
    other sources at our current costs. If our manufacturing
    activities were obstructed or hampered significantly, it could
    take a considerable length of time, or it could increase our
    costs, for us to resume manufacturing or find alternative
    sources of supply. Many of the tools and equipment we use are
    custom-designed, and it could take a significant period of time
    to repair or replace them. In particular, we use complex tools
    in the production of our semiconductor diodes that may be taken
    out of production for months to be serviced and the tools must
    be recertified before they are put back into production. If we
    are unable to successfully recommission these tools in a timely
    fashion, our results of operations and business may be adversely
    affected. Our three major manufacturing facilities are located
    in Oxford, Massachusetts; Burbach, Germany; and Fryazino,
    Russia. If, as a result of a flood, fire, natural disaster,
    political unrest, act of terrorism, war, outbreak of disease or
    other similar event, any of our three major manufacturing
    facilities or equipment should become inoperable, inaccessible,
    damaged or destroyed, our business could be adversely affected
    to the extent that we do not have redundant production
    capabilities.

Also, we purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture our
    products and other components, such as semiconductor wafer
    substrates, modulators and high-power beam delivery products,
    from single or limited-source suppliers. In general, we have no
    long-term contractual supply arrangements with these suppliers.
    Some of our suppliers are also our competitors. Furthermore,
    other than our current suppliers, there are a limited number of
    entities from whom we could obtain these supplies. We do not
    anticipate that we would be able to purchase these components or
    raw materials that we require in a short period of time or at
    the same cost from other sources in commercial quantities or
    that have our required performance specifications. Any
    interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components
    or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and
    materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within
    a reasonable amount of time, could adversely affect our
    business. If our suppliers face financial or other difficulties
    or if there are significant changes in demand for the components
    and materials we obtain from them, they could limit the
    availability of these components and materials to us, which in
    turn could adversely affect our business.

We
    rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of
    our senior management and scientific staff and if we are unable
    to retain these key employees and attract other highly skilled
    personnel necessary to grow our business successfully, our
    business and results of operations could suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued
    service of our executive officers, particularly our founder and
    chief executive officer, Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, and the
    managing director of our German subsidiary IPG Laser GmbH,
    Dr. Eugene Shcherbakov, our highly trained team of
    scientists, many of whom have numerous years of experience and
    specialized expertise in optical fibers, semiconductors and
    optical component technology, and other key engineering, sales,
    marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom may
    leave, which could harm our business. The members of our
    scientific staff who are expected to make significant individual
    contributions to our business are also members of our executive
    management team as disclosed under Item 10,
    “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate
    Governance” below. Furthermore, our business requires
    scientists and engineers with experience in several disciplines,
    including physics, optics, materials sciences, chemistry and
    electronics. We will need to continue to recruit and retain
    highly skilled scientists and engineers for certain functions.
    Our future success also depends on our ability to identify,
    attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled
    research and development, managerial, operations, sales,
    marketing and customer service personnel. If we fail to attract,
    integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to
    extend and maintain our scientific expertise and grow our
    business could suffer significantly.

Failure
    to effectively build and expand our direct field service and
    support organization could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

We believe that it will become increasingly important for us to
    provide rapid, responsive service directly to our customers
    throughout the world and to build and expand our own personnel
    resources to provide these services. Any actual or perceived
    lack of direct field service in the locations where we sell or
    try to sell our products may negatively impact our sales efforts
    and, consequently, our revenues. Accordingly, we have an



ongoing effort to develop our direct support systems in Asia,
    one of our largest markets. This requires us to recruit and
    train additional qualified field service and support personnel
    as well as maintain effective and highly trained organizations
    that can provide service to our customers in various countries.
    We may not be able to attract and train additional qualified
    personnel to expand our direct support operations successfully.
    We may not be able to find and engage additional qualified
    third-party resources to supplement and enhance our direct
    support operations. Further, we may incur significant costs in
    providing these direct field and support services. Failure to
    implement our direct support operation effectively could
    adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our
    operating results may suffer.

The
    laser and amplifier industries may experience declining average
    selling prices, which could cause our gross margins to decline
    and harm our operating results.

Products in the laser and amplifier industries generally, and
    our products specifically, have in the past and may in the
    future continue to experience a decline in average selling
    prices (ASPs) as a result of new product and technology
    introductions, increased competition and price pressures from
    significant customers. If the ASPs of our products decline and
    we are unable to increase our unit volumes, introduce new or
    enhanced products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing
    costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our
    existing products, our operating results may be adversely
    affected. In addition, because of our significant fixed costs,
    we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs quickly in
    response to any revenue shortfalls. Because of these factors, we
    may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future
    operating results on a quarterly or annual basis if the ASPs of
    our products continue to decline.

A few
    customers account for a significant portion of our sales, and if
    we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail
    their purchases of our products, our results of operations could
    be adversely affected.

We rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our
    sales. Our top five customers accounted for 20%, 29% and 37% of
    our consolidated net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Our largest customer accounted for 7%, 10% and 13% of sales in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We generally do not enter
    into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase
    our fiber lasers or amplifiers. Our business is characterized by
    short-term purchase orders and shipment schedules. If any of our
    principal customers discontinues its relationship with us,
    replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers
    downturns in its business, our business and results of
    operations could be adversely affected.

We
    have experienced, and expect to experience in the future,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These
    fluctuations may increase the volatility of our stock
    price.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We believe that
    fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of
    our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. Factors
    which may have an influence on our operating results in a
    particular quarter include:

•

the increase, decrease, cancellation or rescheduling of
    significant customer orders;

•

the timing of revenue recognition based on the installation or
    acceptance of certain products shipped to our customers;

•

seasonality attributable to different purchasing patterns and
    levels of activity throughout the year in the areas where we
    operate;

•

the timing of customer qualification of our products and
    commencement of volume sales of systems that include our
    products;

•

the rate at which our present and future customers and end users
    adopt our technologies;

•

the gain or loss of a key customer;

•

product or customer mix;



•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

the relative proportions of our U.S. and international
    sales;

•

our ability to design, manufacture and introduce new products on
    a cost-effective and timely basis;

•

our ability to manage our inventory levels and any inventory
    write-downs;

•

the incurrence of expenses to develop and improve application
    and support capabilities, the benefits of which may not be
    realized until future periods, if at all;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

foreign currency fluctuations; and

•

our ability to control expenses.

These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict our
    operating results. In addition, our ability to accurately
    predict our operating results is complicated by the fact that
    many of our products have long sales cycles, some lasting as
    long as twelve months. Once a sale is made, our delivery
    schedule typically ranges from four weeks to four months, and
    therefore our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the
    same quarter that they are received and will not enhance our
    ability to predict our results for future quarters. In addition,
    long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses
    without offsetting revenues since customers typically expend
    significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our
    products before making a decision to purchase them. Moreover,
    customers may cancel or reschedule shipments, and production
    difficulties could delay shipments. Accordingly, our results of
    operations are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter
    to quarter, and we may not be able to accurately predict when
    these fluctuations will occur.

We
    depend on our OEM customers and system integrators and their
    ability to incorporate our products into their
    systems.

Our future growth will depend in part on our ability to maintain
    existing and secure new OEM customers. Our revenues also depend
    in part upon the ability of our current and potential OEM
    customers and system integrators to develop and sell systems
    that incorporate our laser and amplifier products. The
    commercial success of these systems depends to a substantial
    degree on the efforts of these OEM customers and system
    integrators to develop and market products that incorporate our
    technologies. Relationships and experience with traditional
    laser makers, limited marketing resources, reluctance to invest
    in research and development and other factors affecting these
    OEM customers and third-party system integrators could have a
    substantial impact upon our financial results. If OEM customers
    or integrators are not able to adapt existing tools or develop
    new systems to take advantage of the features and benefits of
    fiber lasers, then the opportunities to increase our revenues
    and profitability may be severely limited or delayed.
    Furthermore, if our OEM customers or third-party system
    integrators experience financial or other difficulties that
    adversely affect their operations, our financial condition or
    results of operations may also be adversely affected.

The
    markets for our products are highly competitive and increased
    competition could increase our costs, reduce our sales or cause
    us to lose market share.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by
    significant price and technological competition. Our fiber laser
    and amplifier products compete with conventional laser
    technologies and amplifier products offered by several
    well-established companies, some of which are larger and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do. Also, we compete with widely used
    non-laser production methods, such as resistance welding. We
    believe that competition will be particularly intense from
    makers of
    CO


and YAG lasers, as these makers of traditional solutions may
    lower prices to maintain current market share and have committed
    significant research and development resources to pursue
    opportunities related to these technologies.



In addition, we face competition from a growing number of fiber
    laser makers. We also expect competition from established laser
    makers which may have started or may start programs to develop
    and sell fiber lasers or solid state laser technology
    alternatives to fiber lasers. Several established laser makers,
    including Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc., Trumpf Inc., Newport
    Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. and others, have
    recently introduced fiber lasers, or have announced plans to
    develop fiber-based lasers, that would compete with our
    products. Because many of the components required to develop and
    produce low-power fiber lasers and amplifiers are commercially
    available, barriers to entry are relatively low, and we expect
    new competitive products to be introduced. We may not be able to
    successfully differentiate our current and proposed products
    from our competitors’ products and current or prospective
    customers may not consider our products to be superior to
    competitors’ products. To maintain our competitive
    position, we believe that we will be required to continue a high
    level of investment in research and development, application
    development and customer service and support, and to react to
    market pricing conditions. We may not have sufficient resources
    to continue to make these investments and we may not be able to
    make the technological advances or price adjustments necessary
    to maintain our competitive position. We also compete against
    our OEM customers’ internal production of competitive laser
    technologies.

Our
    inability to manage risks associated with our international
    customers and operations could adversely affect our
    business.

Our products are currently marketed and sold in numerous
    countries. The United States, Germany, Japan, Russia and China
    are our principal markets. A significant amount of our revenues
    are derived from customers outside of the United States. We
    anticipate that foreign sales will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
    Our operations and sales in these markets are subject to risks
    inherent in international business activities, including:

•

longer accounts receivable collection periods;

•

fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies;

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s economic
    conditions, such as recession;

•

compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and
    regulations and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory
    requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs,
    quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade
    barriers;

•

certification requirements;

•

environmental regulations;

•

less effective protection of intellectual property rights in
    some countries;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts,
    and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in
    the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers,
    manufacturers and subcontractors are located;

•

preference for locally produced products;

•

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international
    operations across different geographic areas and cultures;

•

seasonal reductions in business activities; and

•

fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.

Political and economic instability and changes in governmental
    regulations could adversely affect both our ability to
    effectively operate our foreign sales offices and the ability of
    our foreign suppliers to supply us



with required materials or services. Any interruption or delay
    in the supply of our required components, products, materials or
    services, or our inability to obtain these components,
    materials, products or services from alternate sources at
    acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could
    impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our
    customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.

We are also subject to risks of doing business in Russia through
    our indirect subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, which provides
    components and test equipment to us and sells finished fiber
    devices to customers in Russia and neighboring countries. The
    results of operations, business prospects and facilities of NTO
    IRE-Polus are subject to the economic and political environment
    in Russia. In recent years Russia has undergone substantial
    political, economic and social change. As is typical of an
    emerging market, Russia does not possess a well-developed
    business, legal and regulatory infrastructure that would
    generally exist in a more mature free market economy. In
    addition, the tax, currency and customs legislation within
    Russia is subject to varying interpretations and changes, which
    can occur frequently. The future economic direction of Russia
    remains largely dependent upon the effectiveness of economic,
    financial and monetary measures undertaken by the government,
    together with tax, legal, regulatory and political developments.
    Our failure to manage the risks associated with NTO IRE-Polus
    and our other existing and potential future international
    business operations could have a material adverse effect upon
    our results of operations.

Foreign
    currency transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales,
    cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange
    losses.

We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of
    most countries in which we operate. In 2007, our net sales
    outside the United States represented a significant portion of
    our total sales. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one
    of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a
    sales transaction using a different currency from the currency
    in which it receives revenues. We have entered into a foreign
    currency forward contract to offset our exposure to currency
    transaction risks primarily related to intercompany loans,
    receivables and payables, but we do not currently hedge against
    other foreign currency exchange risks. Changes in exchange rates
    can also affect our results of operations by changing the
    U.S. dollar value of sales and expenses denominated in
    foreign currencies. We cannot accurately predict the impact of
    future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.
    Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be
    able to effectively manage our currency transaction or
    translation risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates
    may increase the price of our products in local currency to our
    foreign customers, which may have an adverse effect on our
    financial condition, cash flows and profitability.

Our
    products could contain defects, which may reduce sales of those
    products, harm market acceptance of our fiber laser products or
    result in claims against us.

The manufacture of our fiber lasers and amplifiers involves
    highly complex and precise processes. Despite testing by us and
    our customers, errors have been found, and may be found in the
    future, in our products. These defects may cause us to incur
    significant warranty, support and repair costs, incur additional
    costs related to a recall, divert the attention of our
    engineering personnel from our product development efforts and
    harm our relationships with our customers. These problems could
    result in, among other things, loss of revenues or a delay in
    revenue recognition, loss of market share, harm to our
    reputation or a delay or loss of market acceptance of our fiber
    laser products. Defects, integration issues or other performance
    problems in our fiber laser and amplifier products could also
    result in personal injury or financial or other damages to our
    customers, which in turn could damage market acceptance of our
    products. Our customers could also seek damages from us for
    their losses. A product liability claim brought against us, even
    if unsuccessful, could be time-consuming and costly to defend.

We may
    pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses, products,
    patents or technologies. These may involve risks which could
    disrupt our business and may harm our financial
    condition.

We currently have no commitments or agreements to make any
    acquisitions and have limited experience in making acquisitions.
    In the future, we may make acquisitions of and investments in
    new businesses, products, patents, technologies and geographic
    areas, or we may acquire operations, products or technologies



that expand our current capabilities. Acquisitions present a
    number of potential risks and challenges that could, if not met,
    disrupt our business operations, increase our operating costs
    and reduce the value of the acquired company, asset or
    technology to us. For example, if we identify an acquisition
    candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or
    finance the acquisition on favorable terms. Even if we are
    successful, we may not be able to integrate the acquired
    businesses, products, patents or technologies into our existing
    business and products. As a result of the rapid pace of
    technological change in our industry, we may misjudge the

long-term

potential of the acquired business, product, patents or
    technology, or the acquisition may not be complementary to our
    existing business. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and
    investments, whether or not consummated, may divert our
    management’s attention and require considerable cash
    outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition,
    to complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities,
    incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization
    expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could
    adversely affect our profitability and result in dilution to our
    existing and future stockholders.

We are
    subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could
    impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial
    condition.

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various
    federal, state, local and international laws governing the
    environment, including those relating to the storage, use,
    discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, and
    human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We could incur
    costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party
    property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required
    to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we
    were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.
    Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and
    without regard to comparative fault. Compliance with current or
    future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our
    ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire
    additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing
    processes, or incur other significant expenses in order to
    remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. At this
    time, we do not believe the costs to maintain compliance with
    current environmental laws to be material. Although we do not
    currently anticipate that such costs will become material, if
    such costs were to become material in the future, whether due to
    unanticipated changes in environmental laws, unanticipated
    changes in our operations or other unanticipated changes, we may
    be required to dedicate additional staff or financial resources
    in order to maintain compliance. There can be no assurance that
    violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur
    in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits,
    human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.

We are
    subject to export control regulations that could restrict our
    ability to increase our international sales and may adversely
    affect our business.

A significant part of our business involves the export of our
    products to other countries. The U.S. government has in
    place a number of laws and regulations that control the export,
    re-export or transfer of

U.S.-origin

products, software and technology. The governments of other
    countries in which we do business have similar regulations
    regarding products, software and technology originating in those
    countries. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain
    a license before we can export, re-export or transfer certain
    products, software or technology. The requirement to obtain a
    license could put us at a competitive disadvantage by
    restricting our ability to sell products to customers in certain
    countries or by giving rise to delays or expenses related to
    obtaining a license. In applying for a license and responding to
    questions from licensing authorities, we have experienced and,
    in the future, may experience delays in obtaining export
    licenses based on issues solely within the control of the
    applicable government agency. Under the discretion of the
    issuing government agency, an export license may permit the
    export of one unit to a single customer or multiple units to one
    or more customers. Licenses may also include conditions that
    limit the use, resale, transfer, re-export, modification,
    disassembly, or transfer of a product, software or technology
    after it is exported without first obtaining permission from the
    relevant government agency. Failure to comply with these laws
    and regulations could result in government sanctions, including
    substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges,
    debarment from government contracts and a loss of revenues.
    Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain required export
    licenses also may require us to defer shipments for substantial
    periods or cancel orders. Any of these circumstances could
    adversely affect our operations and, as a result, our financial
    results could suffer.



Our
    ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our
    failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from
    growing.

We may in the future be required to raise capital through public
    or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may
    not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure
    to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional
    equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common
    stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
    covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise
    funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our
    business or respond to competitive pressures.

Dr. Valentin
    P. Gapontsev, our chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
    principal stockholder, controls approximately 45% of our voting
    power and has a significant influence on the outcome of director
    elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval,
    including a change in corporate control.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, our Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer, and IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd. (IPFD), of which
    Dr. Gapontsev is the managing director and majority owner,
    beneficially own approximately 45% of our common stock. In
    addition, Dr. Denis Gapontsev, our Vice President of
    Research and Development and the son of Dr. Valentin P.
    Gapontsev, beneficially owns approximately 4% of our common
    stock, and collectively with Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev,
    approximately 49% of our common stock. As a result,
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev has a significant influence on
    the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including:

•

election of our directors;

•

amendment of our certificate of incorporation or
    by-laws; and

•

approval of mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev may vote his shares of our common
    stock in ways that are adverse to the interests of other holders
    of our common stock. Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev’s
    significant ownership interest could delay, prevent or cause a
    change in control of our company, any of which could adversely
    affect the market price of our common stock.

Dr. Valentin
    P. Gapontsev, our chairman, chief executive officer and
    principal stockholder, owns a material portion of one of our
    operating subsidiaries, which creates the possibility of a
    conflict of interest.

Although we own 58.6% of NTO IRE-Polus, our Russian subsidiary,
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev owns 26.7%, Igor Samartsev, one
    of our directors, owns 4.9%, and unaffiliated third parties and
    certain current and former employees of NTO IRE-Polus own the
    remaining 9.8%. NTO IRE-Polus provides us with components and
    test equipment and sells finished fiber devices to customers in
    Russia and neighboring countries. Transactions between us and
    NTO IRE-Polus generated approximately $15.8 million and
    $12.3 million of revenues for NTO IRE-Polus for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Dr. Gapontsev’s significant ownership interest in this
    entity creates the possibility of a conflict of interest since,
    by having an ownership interest in both our company and NTO
    IRE-Polus, his economic interests may be affected by
    transactions between the two entities. Under Russian law and NTO
    IRE-Polus’s charter, supermajority or unanimous stockholder
    approval is required to take certain significant non-operational
    actions, such as amending NTO IRE-Polus’s charter, electing
    the executive body or altering certain fundamental stockholder
    rights. Although we have taken steps to address possible
    conflicts of interests and potential issues concerning the
    requirement to obtain supermajority approval, these steps may
    not prove effective.

Anti-takeover
    provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could
    prevent or delay a change in control of our company, even if a
    change in control would be beneficial to our
    stockholders.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws,
    including certain provisions that will take effect when
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev (together with his affiliates and
    associates) ceases to beneficially own an aggregate of 25% or
    more of our outstanding voting securities, may discourage, delay
    or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control, even if
    it would be beneficial to our stockholders. The existence of
    these



provisions could also limit the price that investors might be
    willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
    These provisions include:

•

authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred
    stock;

•

establishing a classified board;

•

providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

•

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;

•

limiting the persons who may call a special meeting of
    stockholders;

•

establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for
    election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to
    be submitted to a stockholder vote; and

•

supermajority stockholder approval to change these provisions.

Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent
    someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining
    control of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law, which will apply to our
    company following such time as Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev
    (together with his affiliates and associates) ceases to
    beneficially own 25% or more of the total voting power of our
    outstanding shares, may prohibit business combinations with
    stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

Substantial
    sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to
    decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the
    perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007,
    we had 44,012,341 shares of common stock outstanding and
    3,531,980 shares subject to outstanding options.

All of our unregistered shares of our common stock are now
    eligible for sale under Rule 144, Rule 144(k) or
    Rule 701. Also, the holders of an aggregate of
    approximately 2,240,000 shares of common stock have
    registration rights, including the right to require us to
    register the sale of their shares and the right to include their
    shares in public offerings that we undertake in the future. We
    have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue
    under our stock option plans. As these shares are issued, they
    may be freely sold in the public market, subject to the

lock-up

restrictions described above, and subject, in the case of any
    awards under our stock-based compensation plans, to applicable
    vesting requirements.

We
    incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of
    complying with the laws and regulations affecting public
    companies, which could adversely affect our operating
    results.

As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and
    other expenses that we did not incur as a private company,
    including costs associated with public company reporting
    requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs
    associated with recently adopted corporate governance
    requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act of 2002, as well as new rules implemented by the SEC and the
    Nasdaq Global Market. The expenses incurred by public companies
    generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have
    been increasing. These rules and regulations have significantly
    increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our legal
    and financial compliance costs and have made some activities
    more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations have
    also made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain
    director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required
    to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
    substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar
    coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to
    attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board
    of directors or as our executive officers.



We are
    required to evaluate our internal control over financial
    reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002, and any adverse results from such evaluation could result
    in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and
    have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
    we are required to furnish a report by our management on our
    internal control over financial reporting. Such a report is
    required to contain, among other matters, an assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to
    whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is
    effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any
    material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
    reporting identified by management. Our independent registered
    public accounting firm is also required to issue an opinion on
    the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    and attest that management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    is fairly stated.

If our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in
    our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable
    to assert that such internal control is effective. If we are
    unable to assert that our internal control over financial
    reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public
    accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the
    effectiveness of our internal controls or attest that our
    management’s report is fairly stated, investors could lose
    confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial
    reports, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

We do
    not anticipate paying dividends on our capital stock in the
    foreseeable future.

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital
    stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the
    foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain any future
    earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and
    development of our business. Our payment of any future dividends
    will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking
    into account general economic and business conditions, any
    contractual and legal restrictions on our payment of dividends,
    and our financial condition, operating results, cash needs and
    growth plans. In addition, current agreements with certain of
    our lenders contain, and future loan agreements may contain,
    restrictive covenants that generally prohibit us from paying
    cash dividends, making any distribution on any class of stock or
    making stock repurchases.

If
    securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about
    our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our
    stock could decline.

The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the
    research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish
    about us. If one or more of these analysts who do cover us
    downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
    Further, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our
    company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn
    could cause our stock price to decline.

    primarily for manufacturing and administration.

We maintain our corporate headquarters in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    and conduct research and development in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    Burbach, Germany and Fryazino, Russia. We operate four
    manufacturing facilities for lasers, amplifiers and components,
    which are located in the United States, Germany, Russia and
    Italy. We also manufacture certain optical components and
    systems in India and China. We are committed to meeting
    internationally recognized manufacturing standards. Our
    facilities in the United States and Germany are ISO 9001
    certified and we have ISO certification in Russia for specific
    products. We have sales personnel at each of our manufacturing
    facilities, at offices in Michigan; London, England; Yokohama
    and Chibu, Japan; Daejeon, South Korea; Bangalore, India; and
    Beijing, China.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our
    current needs and that we will be able to obtain additional
    commercial space as needed.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings and
    other disputes incidental to our business, including those
    described below. For a discussion of the risks associated with
    these legal proceedings and other disputes, see Item 1A.
    “Risk Factors — We Are Subject to Litigation
    Alleging That We Are Infringing Third-Party Intellectual
    Property Rights. Intellectual Property Claims Could Result in
    Costly Litigation and Harm Our Business.”

We are a defendant in an action by IMRA America, Inc. filed in
    November 2006 in the United States District Court for the
    Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff alleges that certain
    products that we produce, including but not limited to our
    continuous wave and pulsed fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers,
    which account for a significant portion of our revenues,
    infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA America,
    and seeks damages in excess of $10 million, treble damages
    and attorneys’ fees for alleged willful infringement and
    injunctive relief. The plaintiff also alleges inducement of
    infringement and contributory infringement. The patent claims
    generally relate to an optical amplification system in which a
    mode converter receives an input beam with a nearly diffraction
    limited mode from a laser source and converts the mode to match
    a fundamental mode of a multi-mode fiber amplifier, which
    amplifier provides at an output an amplified beam



substantially in the fundamental mode. The patent expires in
    June 2017. We filed an answer to the plaintiff’s complaint
    denying infringement and raising the additional defenses that
    the patent is invalid and unenforceable, and we also filed
    declaratory judgment counterclaims based on these three
    defenses. We petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark
    Office to re-examine the patent based on several prior art
    references. The US PTO is considering our re-examination
    request. The case is in the discovery stage, and trial has been
    set for August 5, 2008. We intend to vigorously contest the
    claims against us, but we cannot predict the outcome of the
    proceeding.

We, along with eight medical laser system manufacturers, are a
    defendant in an action by CardioFocus Inc. filed in February
    2008 in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts. The plaintiff alleges that our erbium and thulium
    fiber lasers infringe one patent allegedly owned by CardioFocus
    and seeks unspecified damages, treble damages and
    attorneys’ fees for alleged willful infringement. The
    plaintiff also alleges inducement of infringement. The patent
    claim generally relate to a system for transmitting laser energy
    via an optical fiber to a surgical site. The patent expired in
    April 2007. We intend to file an answer to the complaint raising
    several defenses. We intend to vigorously contest the claims
    against us, but we cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding.

    approximately 150 holders of record, which does not include
    beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the
    names of various securities brokers, dealers and registered
    clearing agencies.

Dividends

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital
    stock. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to
    support operations and to finance the growth and development of
    our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends
    in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends
    will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking
    into account any business conditions, any contractual and legal
    restrictions on our payment of dividends, and our financial
    condition, operating results, cash needs and growth plans. In
    addition, current agreements with certain of our lenders
    contain, and future loan agreements may contain, restrictive
    covenants that generally prohibit us from paying cash dividends,
    making any distribution on any class of stock or making stock
    repurchases.



Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from
    Registered Securities

During the past three years, we have sold and issued the
    following unregistered securities:

1. In connection with our initial public offering, all
    outstanding shares of our series A preferred stock
    converted in to 359,463 shares of our common stock, all
    outstanding shares of our series B preferred stock
    converted into 7,252,927 shares of our common stock and all
    outstanding shares of our series D preferred stock
    converted into 1,683,168 shares of our common stock.

2. Since January 1, 2005, we have granted options to
    purchase 2,048,643 shares of our common stock at exercise
    prices ranging from $1.50 to $9.60 per share to employees,
    consultants and directors under our 2000 Incentive Compensation
    Plan, our 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan and our Non-Employee
    Directors Stock Plan. From January 1, 2005 through
    December 31, 2007, we have issued 1,530,296 unregistered
    shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock
    options for aggregate consideration of $2.6 million.

The sales of securities described in item (1) above were
    deemed to be exempt from registration pursuant to
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D
    promulgated thereunder as transactions by an issuer not
    involving a public offering. Each of these sales was to
    “accredited investors,” as such term is defined in
    Rule 501 of Regulation D. Each of the recipients of
    securities in the transactions deemed to be exempt from
    registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    received written disclosures that the securities had not been
    registered under the Securities Act and that any resale must be
    made pursuant to a registration or an available exemption from
    such registration. The issuances of the securities described in
    item (2) above were deemed to be exempt from registration
    pursuant to either Rule 701 promulgated under the
    Securities Act as a transaction pursuant to compensatory benefit
    plans approved by our board of directors or, where such
    recipients of securities under these compensatory plans were
    “accredited investors” because the recipients were
    directors or executive officers of our company, under
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as transactions by an
    issuer not involving a public offering. None of the sales of the
    securities described in items (1) and (2) above
    involved the use of an underwriter, and no commissions were paid
    in connection with the sale of any of the securities that we
    issued. The sales of these securities were made without general
    solicitation or advertising.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, there were no
    repurchases made by us or on our behalf, or by any
    “affiliated purchasers,” of shares of our common stock.

Due primarily to certain stock-based compensation awarded
    primarily in 2000 and 2001, we have recorded significant
    stock-based compensation during the year ended December 31,
    2003. Those awards became fully vested during the year ended
    December 31, 2004. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and



Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates — Stock-Based Compensation.”

(2)

The change in value of the series B warrants is a non-cash
    charge related to recording the increase or decrease in the fair
    value of the warrants prior to their conversion in December
    2006. The change in fair value for this derivative instrument
    was directly related to the probability that the warrants would
    be exercised prior to their expiration in April 2008. We used a
    portion of the net proceeds from our IPO to repurchase the
    series B warrants. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Factors and Trends That Affect our

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with Item 6, “Selected Consolidated
    Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements
    and related notes included in this Annual Report of

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
    materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
    statements as a result of certain factors including, but not
    limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors.”

Overview

We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance
    fiber lasers for diverse applications in numerous markets. Fiber
    lasers are a new generation of lasers that combine the
    advantages of semiconductor diodes, such as long life and high
    efficiency, with the high amplification and precise beam
    qualities of specialty optical fibers to deliver superior
    performance, reliability and usability at a generally lower
    total cost of ownership compared to conventional
    CO


and crystal lasers. Our products are displacing traditional
    lasers in many current applications and enabling new
    applications for lasers.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, advanced,
    communications and medical applications. We sell our products
    globally to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system
    integrators and end users. We market our products
    internationally primarily through our direct sales force and
    also through agreements with independent sales representatives
    and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States,
    Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, South Korea,
    India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture
    all key components used in our finished products, from
    semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber
    lasers and amplifiers. Our



vertically integrated operations allow us to reduce
    manufacturing costs, ensure access to critical components and
    rapidly develop and integrate advanced products while protecting
    our proprietary technology.

Since our formation in 1990 in Russia, we have been focused on
    developing and manufacturing high-power fiber lasers and
    amplifiers. We established manufacturing and research operations
    in Germany in 1994 and in the United States in 1998. In the
    following years, we developed numerous OEM customer
    relationships for our advanced, active fiber-based products and
    generated a substantial majority of our sales from
    communications companies. Despite the significant economic
    downturn in the communications industry during 2001 and 2002, we
    invested in developing and manufacturing our own semiconductor
    diodes, one of our highest-cost components, rather than
    purchasing them from third-party vendors. Also, we developed new
    products with higher output levels, targeting new applications
    and markets outside of the communications industry, particularly
    materials processing.

In December 2006, we completed our IPO of 10,350,000 shares
    of common stock at $16.50 per share, comprised of 6,241,379
    primary shares and 4,108,621 shares offered by selling
    stockholders. In connection with the IPO, all of the outstanding
    shares of our preferred stock were converted into an aggregate
    of 9,295,558 shares of common stock.

Description
    of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses

Net sales.

We derive net sales primarily from
    the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode
    lasers, communications systems and complementary products. We
    develop our products to standard specifications and use a common
    set of components within our product architectures. We sell our
    products through our direct sales organization and our network
    of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system
    integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials
    processing laser systems, communications systems and medical
    laser systems to end users. We also sell our products to end
    users that build their own systems which incorporate our
    products or use our products as an energy or light source. Sales
    of our products generally are recognized upon shipment, provided
    that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
    reasonably assured.

Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a
    few weeks to as long as one year or more. Our scientists and
    engineers work closely with OEMs and end users to analyze their
    system requirements and select and meet appropriate
    specifications. Our major products are based upon a common
    technology platform. We continually enhance these and other
    products by improving their components as well as by developing
    new components. Although it is difficult to predict the life
    cycles of our products and what stage of the life cycle our
    products are in, we estimate that our major products are in the
    early stages of their life cycles. Our sales typically are made
    on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase
    commitments.

The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as
    the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as
    increased competition, the introduction of new products,
    increases in unit volumes and market share considerations. In
    the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to
    penetrate new markets and applications in which previously it
    was not economically feasible for customers to deploy our
    products. Furthermore, we offer volume discounts to customers
    who buy multiple units. We cannot predict the timing and degree
    of these price declines.

Cost of sales.

Our cost of sales consists
    primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct
    labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically
    integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for
    our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe
    our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies,
    leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales
    also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our
    manufacturing and engineering operations, related occupancy and
    equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory
    obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are
    written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as
    excess or obsolete.



Due to our vertical integration strategy, we maintain a
    relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We cannot adjust
    these fixed costs quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market
    conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of net sales, is greatly impacted by our sales volume
    and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead
    expenses. Additionally, because many of our products are
    customized, we are frequently required to devote significant
    engineering resources to the sales process, which we also
    include in cost of product sales as incurred.

Sales and marketing.

Our sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of compensation, costs of
    advertising, trade shows, professional and technical
    conferences, promotions, travel related to our sales and
    marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and
    other marketing costs.

Research and development.

Our research and
    development expense consists primarily of compensation, test and
    development expenses related to the design of our products and
    certain components, and facilities costs. We use a common
    research and development platform for our products. Costs
    related to product development are recorded as research and
    development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

General and administrative.

Our general and
    administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and
    associated costs for executive management, finance and other
    administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated
    facilities costs and other corporate expenses.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

In connection with the issuance of our
    series B preferred stock in 2000, we issued warrants to
    purchase shares of our common stock. In December 2006, we
    repurchased the series B warrants with a portion of the
    proceeds from our IPO. The fair value adjustment to our
    series B warrants was a non-cash benefit or expense
    relating to a change in the fair value of the warrants. These
    warrants were accounted for as a derivative and were exercisable
    only after an initial public offering, a merger or liquidation
    or the sale of a majority of our common stock. A change in the
    fair value of the warrants was based on a change in the
    probability of any of such events occurring prior to the
    expiration of the warrants. We incurred a non-cash benefit or
    expense each quarter based upon the increase or decrease,
    respectively, in the fair value of the warrants until such
    warrants were repurchased. Following the IPO, we recorded no
    further adjustments to the fair value of these warrants in our
    financial statements because they were repurchased.

Minority interests in consolidated
    subsidiaries.

Our financial statements
    consolidate the financial results of our subsidiaries, including
    the subsidiaries that are not wholly owned by us. We own all of
    the stock of our subsidiaries, except for 20% of our Italian
    subsidiary, IPG Fibertech S.r.l., 41.4% of our Russian
    subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, 20% of our Japanese subsidiary, IPG
    Photonics (Japan) Ltd. (IPG Japan), and 10% of our South Korean
    subsidiary, IPG Photonics (Korea) Ltd. We reduce or increase our
    net income by the net income or loss, respectively, attributable
    to the minority ownership interest in such subsidiaries. In the
    event that any losses attributable to the minority stockholders
    of these subsidiaries exceed the minority interest in the equity
    capital of the subsidiaries, we recognize the amount of such
    excess and any further losses attributable to the minority
    stockholders in full in our consolidated statements of
    operations because either the minority stockholders do not have
    the ability to absorb such losses or they are not obligated to
    do so. Such excess losses historically have not been significant
    and we do not expect them to be significant in future periods.

Factors
    and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial
    Results

In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the
    following factors and trends that our management believes are
    important in understanding our financial performance.

Net sales.

From 2003 to 2007, our net sales
    grew from $33.7 million to $188.7 million,
    representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 54%.
    The principal drivers of our net sales growth have been
    (i) introduction of new products, including our high-power
    lasers, and increasing demand for our products, fueled by the
    decreasing average cost per watt of output power, (ii) the
    expansion of our product line into higher output power levels,
    (iii) the growing market acceptance of fiber lasers, and
    (iv) the development of new applications for our products
    and new OEM customer relationships. While we believe we have
    multiple opportunities for additional net sales growth, we do
    not expect our net sales percentage growth rates to



continue to be as high as those we have historically
    experienced. Our annual revenue growth rates have decreased from
    80% in 2004 to 59% in 2005, 49% in 2006 and 32% in 2007. We
    experienced periods of rapid growth from 1998 to 2000 and from
    2002 to the present, as well as a period when net sales
    decreased in 2001 and 2002 following the decline in the
    communications market. Since 2002, we have diversified our end
    markets and reduced our reliance on any particular industry.

In planning our business, we take into account the cyclical
    nature of some of the end markets that we serve, as well as the
    longer-term historical patterns in the development of our
    business. For example, our net sales growth from materials
    processing applications could slow if there is a decline in
    investment in machinery and equipment used in manufacturing. Net
    sales derived from communications sales were adversely affected
    following the increase in inventory levels of communications
    devices in 2000 and 2001.

Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to
    quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter
    can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers,
    the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our
    customers’ facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time
    orders for products with large purchase prices, and seasonal
    factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity
    throughout the year in the regions where we operate.
    Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half
    of the year than in the first half of the year. Furthermore, net
    sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products
    for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve.
    The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification
    in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a
    period, which may then slow until we further penetrate new
    markets or obtain new customers.

Gross margin.

One of our important objectives
    is maintaining and improving our gross margin, which is our
    gross profit expressed as a percentage of our net sales. In the
    last three years our gross margins have increased from 35.2% in
    2005 to 44.2% in 2006 and 45.0% in 2007.

Our total gross margin in any period can be affected by total
    net sales in any period, product mix, that is, the percentage of
    our revenue in that period that is attributable to higher or
    lower-power products, and by other factors, some of which are
    not under our control. Our product mix affects our margins
    because the selling price per watt is higher for low and
    mid-power devices than for high-power devices. The overall cost
    of high-power lasers may be partially offset by improved
    absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales of
    larger volumes of higher-power products.

Due to the fact that we have high fixed costs, our costs are
    difficult to adjust in response to changes in demand. In
    addition, our fixed costs will increase as we expand our
    capacity. Gross margins generally have improved because of
    greater absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales
    of larger volumes of higher-power products. However, if the rate
    at which our fixed costs increases is greater than the growth
    rate of our net sales or if we have production issues or
    inventory write-downs, our gross margins could be negatively
    affected. The improvement in gross margin in 2007 was lower than
    that achieved between 2003 and 2006 due to significant
    investment in capacity expansion and absorption of fixed costs
    that was substantially the same in 2007 as 2006 and lower diode
    yields and which, in part, negatively affected the fourth
    quarter of 2007.

Therefore, our manufacturing costs as a percentage of net sales
    are volatile and can increase or decrease depending on total net
    sales and sales mix in a period. For example, gross margins were
    46.3%, 46.2%, 45.3% and 42.9%, respectively, for the three
    months ended March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007,
    September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2007.

We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow
    moving, have been rendered obsolete or determined to be excess,
    and any write-off of such slow moving, obsolete or excess
    inventory affects our gross margins.

The factors that can influence the gross margins derived from
    sales of any individual product include the following:

•

factors that affect the prices we can charge, including the
    features and performance of our products, their output power,
    the nature of the end user and application, and competitive
    pressures;



•

factors that affect the cost of our net sales, including the
    cost of raw materials and components, manufacturing costs and
    shipping costs;

•

production volumes and yields of specific product lines or
    components; and

•

in the case of our OEM customers, the type of market that they
    serve and the competitive pricing pressures faced by our OEM
    customers.

While we believe that we have opportunities to improve our gross
    margins, we do not expect improvements in our gross margins to
    continue to be as high as those we have historically
    experienced. Also, gross margins could be negatively affected by
    our capacity expansion.

Cost of diodes.

Prior to 2004, we used
    semiconductor diodes purchased from a third-party supplier. In
    2004, we began production at our semiconductor diode
    manufacturing facility, which enabled us to significantly reduce
    the cost of our semiconductor diodes and eliminate reliance upon
    suppliers for this component. For many of our products,
    particularly at higher power levels, the cost of diodes is the
    most important factor in determining the price of the product.
    In addition, we have increased the output power of an individual
    semiconductor diode, further reducing our cost per watt. We do
    not anticipate that any further reductions in the cost of diodes
    will be as significant as we have experienced in the past.

Sales and marketing expense.

We expect to
    continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization,
    build and expand applications centers, hire additional personnel
    involved in marketing in our existing and new geographic
    locations, increase the number of units used for demonstration
    purposes, and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and
    marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net
    sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses
    will increase in the aggregate.

Research and development expense.

We plan to
    continue to invest in research and development to improve our
    existing components and products and develop new components and
    products. We plan to increase the personnel involved in research
    and development and expect to increase other research and
    development expenses. As such, we expect that our research and
    development expenses will increase in the aggregate.

General and administrative expense.

We expect
    our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase
    as we expand headcount to support the growth of our company,
    comply with public company reporting obligations and regulatory
    requirements, incur higher insurance expenses related to
    directors’ and officers’ insurance and continue to
    invest in our financial reporting systems. We expect future
    increases in these expenses to be more moderate than those that
    we experienced in 2007. Legal expenses are expected to increase
    in response to pending litigation and may increase in response
    to any future litigation or intellectual property matters, the
    timing and amount of which may vary substantially from quarter
    to quarter.

Major customers.

We have historically depended
    on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net
    sales. The composition of this group can change from year to
    year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a
    percentage of our annual net sales were 37% in 2005, 29% in 2006
    and 20% in 2007. Sales to our largest customer accounted for
    13%, 10% and 7% of our net sales in 2005, 2006 and 2007,
    respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our
    relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the
    composition of our net sales to our significant customers will
    continue to change. If any of our significant customers were to
    substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would
    be adversely affected.

Effect of preferred stock on net income and net income per
    share.

Our net income per share computations
    historically have been impacted by our convertible preferred
    stock, convertible debt and the series B warrants which
    were outstanding prior to our IPO in December 2006. We no longer
    have any such convertible debt or equity instruments
    outstanding. As such, our net income per share computations will
    no longer be adjusted for the effects of these convertible
    instruments for the periods following the completion of the IPO
    in December 2006.

In connection with the issuance of our series B preferred
    stock, we issued warrants (the series B warrants) to
    purchase, in the aggregate, shares of our common stock valued at
    $47.5 million at an equivalent per-share



price of 50% of the fair value on the date of an initial public
    offering of common stock or the sale, merger or liquidation of
    our company. The series B warrants constituted freestanding
    derivatives that were accounted for as liabilities at fair value
    and the changes in fair value of the series B warrants were
    recorded as non-cash expenses or benefits. Any increase in the
    fair value of the series B warrants had the effect of
    reducing our reported net income and net income per share. For
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value
    of the series B warrants increased by $7.4 million and
    $0.7 million, respectively. We repurchased the
    series B warrants in December 2006 and we recorded
    incremental expense associated with the series B warrants
    totaling approximately $3.1 million, representing the
    increase in fair value from the carrying value on the most
    recent measurement date to the $22.1 million repurchase
    value. In subsequent quarters, we have not recognized and will
    not recognize any further income or expense with respect to the
    series B warrants.

The terms of our series A preferred stock and series B
    preferred stock included price protection or anti-dilution
    features that constituted a contingent beneficial conversion
    feature (or deemed dividend) that were recorded upon the
    resolution of the contingency, the completion of our IPO. The
    deemed dividend did not reduce net income but did reduce net
    income applicable to common stockholders in the computation of
    net income (loss) per share. We recorded a deemed dividend
    totaling approximately $18.3 million in the quarter ended
    December 31, 2006, the quarter in which our IPO occurred.
    No further deemed dividends associated with the beneficial
    conversion features related to our series A preferred stock
    or series B preferred stock will be required in subsequent
    quarters as all outstanding shares of our series A
    preferred stock and series B preferred stock converted into
    shares of our common stock upon completion of our IPO.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales
    and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are
    subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing
    basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those
    related to inventories, income taxes and the fair value of
    certain debt and equity instruments including stock-based
    compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on our
    historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe
    are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
    form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates, which may result in material effects on our operating
    results and financial position. The accounting policies
    described below are those which, in our opinion, involve the
    most significant application of judgment, or involve complex
    estimation, and which could, if different judgments or estimates
    were made, materially affect our reported results of operations
    and financial position.

Revenue recognition.

Our net sales are
    generated from sales of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, diode
    lasers and complementary products. Our products are used in a
    wide range of applications by different types of end users or
    used as components or integrated into systems by OEMs or system
    integrators, and are often used as sub-assemblies required for
    end products manufactured by or for the customer. We also sell
    communications systems that include our fiber lasers and
    amplifiers as components.

We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”
    SAB No. 104 requires that four basic criteria be met
    before revenue can be recognized: (i) persuasive evidence
    of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or
    services have been rendered; (iii) the fee is fixed or
    determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue from the sale of our products is generally
    recognized upon shipment, provided that the other revenue
    recognition criteria have been met. We have no obligation to
    provide upgrades, enhancements or customer support subsequent to
    the sale, other than warranty.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. We defer the revenue on multiple element arrangements if
    the fair values of



all deliverables are not known or if customer acceptance is
    contingent on delivery of specified items or performance
    conditions, if the performance conditions cannot be
    satisfactorily tested prior to shipment or if the Company has
    not met such conditions in the past. Applicable revenue
    recognition criteria are then applied separately to each
    separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. Generally, we receive a customer
    purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and product
    shipment terms are free on board (F.O.B.) shipping point.
    Periodically, our revenue arrangements include customer
    acceptance clauses. Revenue is deferred until customer
    acceptance has been obtained.

Inventory.

Inventory is stated at the lower of
    cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Inventory includes parts and
    components that may be specialized in nature and subject to
    rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for inventory items to
    provide for an estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory.
    The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on
    hand, which we compare with estimated future usage. In addition,
    we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with
    estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to
    reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with
    respect to any part with costs in excess of current market
    value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently
    difficult, particularly given that we make unique components and
    products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete
    inventory by making our best estimate considering the current
    quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for
    this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often
    have limited information on which to base our forecasts. If
    future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of
    excess and obsolete inventory may change. In addition, we
    recorded inventory changes of $2.5 million,
    $1.0 million and $1.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Stock-based compensation.

Prior to
    January 1, 2006, we accounted for stock-based employee
    compensation arrangements in accordance with the intrinsic value
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25).
    Therefore, we did not record any compensation expense for stock
    options we granted to our employees where the exercise price was
    at least equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of
    grant. Stock-based compensation is included in the following
    financial statement captions as follows:

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(SFAS No. 123(R)), by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board (FASB), we complied with the disclosure
    requirements of SFAS No. 123 and
    SFAS No. 148, which required that we disclose our pro
    forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share
    as if we had expensed the options at fair value. As a private
    company, we applied the provisions of SFAS No. 123
    using the minimum value computations, which assume no volatility
    in the fair value of our common stock underlying employee stock
    options. In December 2004, SFAS No. 123 was amended
    (now referred to as SFAS No. 123(R)) and we account
    for any newly issued, modified or settled stock awards on or
    after January 1, 2006 at fair value.

We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the prospective
    transition method. Under this method, compensation costs
    recorded during 2006 and 2007 include: (i) compensation
    costs for all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but
    not yet vested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the
    intrinsic value in accordance with the original provisions of
    APB 25; and (ii) compensation costs for all share-based
    payment awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions



of SFAS No. 123(R). We allocate and record stock-based
    compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service period.

Under SFAS No. 123(R), we calculate the fair value of
    stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model. Determining the appropriate fair value model and
    calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require
    the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
    life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price
    volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value
    of stock-based payment awards represent management’s best
    estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and
    the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors
    change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based
    compensation expense could be materially different in the
    future. The weighted average assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model were 6.25 years for the expected term,
    65% for the expected volatility, and 0% for dividend yield for
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The weighted
    average risk-free rate was 4.51% and 4.75% for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Because there was not a sufficient trading history in the public
    market for our common stock, we are unable to use actual price
    volatility or option life as input assumptions within our
    Black-Scholes valuation model.

The weighted average expected option term for 2006 and 2007
    reflects the application of the simplified method set forth in
    SAB No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

. The
    simplified method defines the life as the average of the
    contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting
    period for all option tranches.

Because there was not a sufficient trading history in the public
    market for our common stock, the fair value of our common stock
    was determined by our board of directors based on consideration
    of relevant factors. Factors considered by our board of
    directors included:

•

independent valuation reports that we received;

•

the

agreed-upon

consideration paid in arms-length transactions in the form of
    convertible preferred stock and common stock;

•

the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our
    common stock at the time of each grant;

•

historical and anticipated fluctuations in our net sales and
    results of operations, which reflect our dependence on certain
    key customers, the cyclical nature of certain of our end markets
    and market acceptance of our products; and

•

the risks of owning our common stock and its non-liquid nature.

For the calculation of expected volatility, because there was
    not a sufficient trading history in the public market for our
    common stock and therefore we lacked company-specific historical
    and implied volatility information, we based our estimate of
    expected volatility on the expected volatility of similar
    entities whose share prices are publicly available. We used the
    following factors to identify similar public entities: industry,
    stage of life cycle, size and profitability. We intend to
    continue to consistently apply this process using the same or
    similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical
    information regarding the volatility of our own share price
    becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the
    identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter
    case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.

As stock-based compensation expense recorded in our statements
    of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2007, is based on options ultimately expected to vest, it has
    been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
    SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    stock-based compensation recorded for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2007, reflects an estimated
    forfeiture rate of 5%. For purposes of preparing the pro forma
    information required under SFAS No. 123 for the
    periods prior to 2006, we accounted for forfeitures as they
    occurred.

In accordance with the prospective transition method, our
    financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to
    reflect, and do not include, the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R). Total employee stock-based



compensation expense recorded under SFAS No. 123(R)
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.3 million.
    We expect that our stock-based compensation expense will
    increase in future periods.

Income taxes.

We account for income taxes
    under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes.” Under this method, we determine the
    deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference
    between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and
    liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
    which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The
    tax consequences of most events recognized in the current
    year’s financial statements are included in determining
    income taxes currently payable. However, because tax laws and
    financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and
    measurement of assets, liabilities, equity, net sales, expenses,
    gains and losses, differences arise between the amount of
    taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and the
    tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in
    the financial statements. Because we assume that the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled,
    respectively, a difference between the tax basis of an asset or
    a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will
    result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years
    when the related assets or liabilities are settled or the
    reported amount of the assets are recovered, giving rise to a
    deferred tax asset or liability. We must then periodically
    assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be
    recovered from our future taxable income, and, to the extent we
    believe that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets
    will not be recovered, we must establish a valuation allowance
    against our deferred tax assets.

We have used our net operating losses in Germany that we have
    previously generated and we are now paying income taxes in
    Germany. In 2006, our valuation allowances related to deferred
    tax assets were reduced by $17.7 million. The reduction
    included $4.6 million related to operating losses used and
    timing differences that were reversed during the year and
    $13.1 million of valuation allowances released in the
    fourth quarter of 2006 after we determined that the underlying
    deferred tax assets primarily consisting of U.S. Federal
    operating loss carryforwards were more likely than not to be
    realized. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining valuation
    allowances were $0.3 million, primarily provided against
    U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards. The release of
    the remaining valuation allowance will depend upon the continued
    improvement in results of our U.S. operations.

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
    No. 48

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(FIN 48), in 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial
    statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transitions. The
    effect of adoption on our results of operations and financial
    condition as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007
    was not material. As of December 31, 2007, we had $865,000
    of unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, all of our
    unrecognized tax benefits would be recorded as a component of
    income tax expense. Estimated penalties and interest related to
    the underpayment of income taxes are $179,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and are included as a component of the
    provision for income taxes.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net sales.

Net sales increased by
    $45.5 million, or 31.8%, to $188.7 million in 2007
    from $143.2 million in 2006. This increase was attributable
    to higher sales of fiber lasers in materials processing
    applications, where net sales increased by $42.4 million,
    or 43.5%, and advanced applications, where net sales increased
    by $5.8 million, or 30.3%. These increases were partially
    offset by a decrease in sales in communications applications of
    $2.2 million, or 14.2%, and medical applications of
    $0.7 million, or 5.9%. The growth in materials processing
    sales resulted primarily from increased market penetration for
    high-power fiber lasers as well as an increase in sales of
    pulsed and medium-power fiber lasers. The decrease in
    communications applications sales was due to lower sales of
    fiber amplifiers to our largest U.S. telecom customer due
    to



increased competition experienced by our customer as well as
    completion of a project with a customer in Asia. This decrease
    was partially offset by increased sales of telecommunications
    systems in Russia. The slight decrease in sales of medical
    applications was due to lower sales to our largest customer for
    this application.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of sales
    increased by $23.8 million, or 29.8%, to
    $103.7 million in 2007 from $79.9 million in 2006, as
    a result of increased sales volume. Our gross margin increased
    to 45.0% in 2007 from 44.2% in 2006. The increase in gross
    margin was the result of slightly more favorable absorption of
    our fixed manufacturing costs in 2007 due to higher production
    volumes, which was reduced by higher expenses related to
    continued expansion of our vertically integrated manufacturing
    capacity. These higher expenses related to manufacturing
    salaries and benefits, facilities, supplies and tooling and
    depreciation. A higher proportion of high-power sales and a
    lower proportion of amplifier sales in 2007 as compared to 2006
    and lower diode yields late in 2007 also affected gross margins
    in 2007. High-power lasers tend to have a lower selling price
    per watt of output and lower contribution margins than
    amplifiers, low-power lasers and pulsed lasers.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $3.9 million, or 62.9%, to
    $10.1 million in 2007 from $6.2 million in 2006,
    primarily as a result of an increase of $1.5 million in
    selling expenses related to an increase in the number of units
    used for demonstration purposes and an increase of
    $1.2 million in personnel costs related to the expansion of
    our worldwide direct sales organization, including our new sales
    and service center in China. The remainder of the increase
    related to increases in costs for trade fairs, travel, premises
    and depreciation. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing
    expense increased to 5.4% in 2007 from 4.4% in 2006. As we
    continue to expand our sales presence and organization worldwide
    we expect expenditures on sales and marketing to continue to
    increase.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $3.0 million, or 46.2%, to
    $9.5 million in 2007 from $6.5 million in 2006. This
    increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.0 million
    in personnel costs and $0.5 million in consulting costs to
    support increased research and development activity. Research
    and development activity continues to focus on enhancing the
    performance of our internally manufactured components, refining
    production processes to improve manufacturing yields and the
    development of new products operating at different wavelengths
    and at higher output powers. As a percentage of sales, research
    and development expense increased to 5.0% in 2007 from 4.6% in
    2006.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expense increased by $4.5 million, or
    31.0%, to $19.0 million in 2007 from $14.5 million in
    2006, primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in
    personnel expenses as we expanded the general and administrative
    function to support the growth of the business and comply with
    the reporting and regulatory requirements of a public company,
    higher stock-compensation costs and increased expenses related
    to our new office in China. General legal, consulting and
    accounting costs increased by $0.6 million due primarily to
    higher audit fees, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance costs and tax
    compliance initiatives. Patent litigation defense fees increased
    by $1.5 million. Insurance costs also increased by
    $0.9 million. These increases were partially offset by
    realized and unrealized gains related to foreign currency of
    $1.2 million in 2007 as compared to $0.8 million of
    losses in 2006. As a percentage of sales, general and
    administrative expense were the same in 2007 and 2006.

Interest income (expense), net.

Interest
    income (expense), net was $0.7 million of net interest
    income in 2007 compared to $1.5 million of net interest
    expense in 2006. The change in interest income (expense), net
    resulted from lower interest expense incurred after the
    repayment of all of our term debt in the first quarter of 2007
    and higher interest income earned on the net proceeds from our
    IPO in December 2006.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

There was no expense related to the
    fair value adjustment of the series B warrants in 2007 as
    compared to $7.4 million in 2006 because we repurchased the
    series B warrants in December 2006. As a result, there will
    be no further charges to record the change in the fair value of
    the series B warrants.

(

Provision for) benefit from income
    taxes.

Provision for income taxes increased by
    $18.5 million to a $15.5 million expense in 2007 from
    a $3.0 million benefit in 2006, representing an effective
    tax rate of 32.6% in 2007 as compared to an effective tax
    benefit of 10.7% in 2006. The increase in the provision for
    income



taxes was primarily due to an increase in earnings before taxes
    and the release in 2006 of our valuation allowance for
    U.S. federal net operating losses. Excluding the release of
    the $13.1 million valuation allowance and the fair value
    adjustment to the series B warrants of $7.4 million,
    the effective tax rate was 28.3% in 2006. The increase in the
    effective tax rate in 2007 is primarily due to an effective tax
    rate applied to

U.S.-generated

income of approximately 35% in 2007 as compared to an effective
    rate of zero percent in 2006. The increase was partially offset
    by a $1.1 million reduction in the carrying value of German
    net deferred tax liabilities due to a change in income tax rates
    in Germany from 38% to approximately 30%. This change in tax
    rates was enacted by the German government during the third
    quarter of 2007 and became effective on January 1, 2008.

Net income.

Net income increased by
    $0.7 million to $29.9 million in 2007 from
    $29.2 million in 2006. Net income as a percentage of our
    net sales decreased by 4.6 percentage points to 15.8% in
    2007 from 20.4% in 2006 due to the factors described above and
    in particular the release in 2006 of the valuation allowance for
    U.S. federal net operating losses, offset by the charges in 2006
    related to the changes in the fair value of the series B
    warrants.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2005

Net sales.

Our net sales increased by
    $46.8 million, or 48.6%, to $143.2 million in 2006
    from $96.4 million in 2005. This increase was primarily
    attributable to a higher volume of sales of fiber lasers in
    materials processing applications, where net sales increased by
    $42.7 million or by 91.0% of the total increase in net
    sales. Medical applications accounted for 8.1% of the total
    increase in net sales. These increases were partially offset by
    a slight decrease in sales in communications applications. The
    growth in net sales resulted primarily from increased market
    acceptance of high-power fiber lasers and the continued growth
    in sales of low and medium-power fiber lasers for materials
    processing. Net sales growth in medical applications resulted
    from an increase in net sales for aesthetic skin procedures.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Our costs of
    sales increased by $17.4 million, or 27.8%, to
    $79.9 million in 2006 from $62.5 million in 2005, as a
    result of the increased sales volume. Our gross margin increased
    to 44.2% in 2006 from 35.2% in 2005 primarily because of a
    reduction in the cost of our internally manufactured optical
    components, including semiconductor diodes, and more favorable
    absorption of fixed manufacturing costs as a result of higher
    production volumes.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $3.0 million, or 93.8%, to
    $6.2 million in 2006 from $3.2 million in 2005,
    primarily as a result of a $1.5 million increase in
    personnel costs due to the expansion of our worldwide direct
    sales organization and increases in related sales commissions,
    compensation, travel and selling expenses related to the cost of
    products used for demonstration purposes. As a percentage of
    sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 4.4% in 2006
    from 3.4% in 2005.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $0.7 million, or 12.1%, to
    $6.5 million in 2006 from $5.8 million in 2005. This
    increase is primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in
    personnel costs related to higher headcount and increased
    research and development activity. Research and development
    activity continues to focus on enhancing the performance of our
    internally manufactured diodes, optical fibers and components,
    refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields of
    optical components, testing new applications for our existing
    products and developing new products. As a percentage of sales,
    research and development expense decreased to 4.6% in 2006 from
    6.0% in 2005.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expenses increased by $3.9 million, or
    36.8%, to $14.5 million in 2006 from $10.6 million in
    2005, primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in legal,
    consulting and accounting costs attributable to new litigation,
    internal control compliance and financial reporting, a
    $0.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses, a
    $0.6 million increase in foreign exchange losses
    attributable to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar
    relative to the Euro and Japanese Yen and a $0.5 million
    increase in depreciation. As a percentage of sales, general and
    administrative expense decreased to 10.1% in 2006 from 11.0% in
    2005.



Interest income (expense), net.

Net interest
    expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 16.7%, to
    $1.5 million in 2006 from $1.8 million in 2005,
    resulting from the repayment of term debt as well as lower
    utilization of our German line-of-credit facilities during 2006.

Fair value adjustment to series B
    warrants.

The fair value adjustment of the
    series B warrants increased by $6.7 million to
    $7.4 million in 2006 as a result of our IPO in December
    2006.

(

Provision for) benefit from income taxes

.  Our
    benefit from income taxes in 2006 was $3.0 million, which
    resulted from a reduction in our valuation allowance primarily
    related to the use of operating losses during the year and also
    the release of valuation allowances of $13.1 million
    related to deferred tax assets that we have determined are more
    likely than not to be realized. This compared to a provision for
    income taxes of $4.1 million in 2005. Our effective tax
    rate in 2006 was a benefit of 10.7% as compared to a provision
    of 34.2% in 2005. Excluding the impact of the release of the
    valuation allowance and the $7.4 million fair value
    adjustment to the series B warrants, which is not
    tax-deductible, our effective tax rate was 28.3% in 2006
    compared to 32.2% in 2005. The decrease in effective tax rates
    is primarily due to changes in the relative amounts of our
    taxable income generated throughout various tax jurisdictions
    and benefits arising from an effective rate on income arising in
    the United States of zero percent because the income was offset
    by the use of operating losses against which we had previously
    established a valuation allowance.

Net income.

Net income increased by
    $21.8 million to $29.2 million in 2006 from
    $7.4 million in 2005. Net income as a percentage of our net
    sales increased by 12.7 percentage points to 20.4% in 2006
    from 7.7% in 2005.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2007
    consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $38.0 million,
    marketable securities of $7.0 million, unused credit lines
    and overdraft facilities of $39.9 million and working
    capital (excluding cash) of $83.2 million. This compares to
    cash and cash equivalents of $75.7 million, unused credit
    lines and overdraft facilities of $13.8 million and working
    capital (excluding cash) of $40.0 million as of
    December 31, 2006. The decrease in cash and cash
    equivalents of $37.7 million from December 31, 2006
    relates primarily to capital expenditures of $34.3 million,
    the repayment of long-term debt of $18.2 million,
    investments in marketable securities of $7.0 million and
    increases in working capital, partially offset by cash provided
    by operating activities and net proceeds from our credit lines
    of $8.3 million.

In the first quarter of 2007, we used $18.2 million of the
    proceeds from our December 2006 IPO to repay substantially all
    of our bank term debt except for the $20.0 million
    subordinated, unsecured, variable-rate notes described in
    Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, which
    mature in 2009. We expect that the existing cash and marketable
    securities, cash flows from operations and our existing lines of
    credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital
    needs for the foreseeable future. Our future long-term capital
    requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of
    net sales growth, the timing and extent of spending to support
    development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing
    activities, the timing and introductions of new products, the
    need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the
    continuing market acceptance of our products. We have made no
    arrangements to obtain additional financing, and there is no
    assurance that such additional financing, if required or
    desired, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to
    us, if at all.

Although we repaid substantially all our fixed-term debt in the
    first quarter of 2007, we intend to maintain and use
    availability under our lines of credit to finance our short-term
    working capital requirements that may arise from time to time.

2.5%

September 2008

Common pool of assets of Japanese subsidiary

(1)

The available principal under this facility can be increased to
    $25 million pursuant to certain notice requirements and
    other conditions.

(2)

This credit facility bears interest at Euribor + 1.0% or EONIA +
    1.5%.

The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to
    not take or to delay investments and actions that we might
    otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures
    and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do
    not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in
    default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may
    result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt
    and a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm
    our results of operations and financial condition.

Operating activities.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities was $10.7 million and
    $19.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. This decrease in net cash provided by
    operating activities of $8.5 million in 2007 as compared to
    2006 primarily resulted from:

•

a decrease in income taxes payable of $11.0 million in 2007
    as compared to an increase in income taxes payable of
    $7.2 million in 2006. The decrease in income taxes payable
    in 2007 primarily resulted from estimated and prior year cash
    tax payments in Germany;

•

a decrease in accrued expenses of $2.9 million in 2007 as
    compared to an increase of $3.4 million in 2006; and

•

a decrease in accounts payable of $6.8 million in 2007 as
    compared to a decrease of $1.1 million in 2006; partially
    offset by

•

an increase in net income after adding back non-cash charges of
    $16.4 million; and

•

a repayment of $5.1 million of supplier convertible notes
    payable in 2006 that did not recur in 2007.

Cash flows generated by operating activities were
    $19.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 as
    compared to $13.6 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming
    testing procedures for both internally manufactured and
    externally purchased components and the lead time required to
    manufacture components used in our finished product, the rate at
    which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared
    to



our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change significantly
    in the future and believe that we will have to maintain a
    relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of
    sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a significant
    amount of working capital invested in inventory and for changes
    in our level of inventory to lead to an increase in cash
    generated from our operations when it is sold or a decrease in
    cash generated from our operations at times when the amount of
    inventory is increasing. A reduction in our level of net sales
    or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels
    would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our
    inventory into accounts receivable would decrease.

Investing activities.

Net cash used in
    investing activities was $41.9 million and
    $19.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in
    2007 was primarily related to $34.3 million of capital
    expenditures on property, plant and equipment and
    $7.0 million to purchase marketable securities. The cash
    used in investing activities in 2006 was related to capital
    expenditures on property, plant and equipment of
    $20.4 million, primarily in the United States and Germany,
    which was partially offset by loan repayments of
    $1.2 million from our stockholders. In 2007 and 2006,
    capital expenditures in the United States, Germany, and Russia
    related to facilities and equipment for diode wafer growth,
    burn-in test stations and packaging as well as new fiber,
    assembly and component production facilities. We expect to
    continue to invest in property, plant and equipment and to use a
    significant amount of our cash generated from operations to
    finance capital expenditures, including the expansion of our
    manufacturing capacity, the acquisition of additional sales and
    application facilities and the purchase of production equipment.
    The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between
    periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. Many of
    the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long
    lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer in the event
    that our net sales are reduced or if our rate of growth slows,
    with the result that it would be difficult to defer committed
    capital expenditures to a later period. Net cash used in
    investing activities was $19.1 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $8.6 million in the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

Financing activities.

Net cash used by
    financing activities was $6.8 million in 2007 as compared
    to net cash provided by financing activities of
    $66.9 million in 2006. The cash used in financing
    activities in 2007 was related to repayment of
    $18.2 million of our long-term bank debt, partially offset
    by the net proceeds of $8.3 million from the use of our
    credit lines and $3.1 million of proceeds from the exercise
    of stock options and associated tax benefits. Net cash provided
    by financing activities in 2006 included $93.2 million of
    net proceeds from our IPO in December 2006, partially offset by
    the repurchase of the series B warrants for
    $22.1 million and net long-term bank debt and credit line
    repayments of $5.9 million. Net cash provided by financing
    activities was $66.9 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to $1.1 million in the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, which
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
    recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
    FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosures and transitions. FIN No. 48
    became effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007.
    Adoption did not have a material impact on the financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
    provides a single definition of fair value, along with a
    framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure
    about using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value measurement is
    market-based, not entity-specific, and establishes a fair value
    hierarchy in which the highest priority is quoted prices in
    active markets. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value
    measurements are disclosed according to their level within this
    hierarchy. While SFAS No. 157 does not add any new
    fair value measurements, it does change current practice in
    certain ways, including requiring entities to include their own
    credit standing when measuring their liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 was initially effective for the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008.
    However, in February 2008, the FASB decided that an entity need
    not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    nonrecurring basis until the subsequent year. Accordingly, the
    Company’s adoption of this standard on January 1, 2008
    is limited to financial assets and liabilities. The Company does
    not believe the initial adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
    have a material effect on its financial condition or results of
    operations. However, the Company is still in the process of
    evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore has not yet
    determined the impact that it will have on its financial
    statements upon full adoption.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 159”), which provides
    companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements relating to
    the use of fair values within the financial statements. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for the
    Company beginning after January 1, 2008. The Company does
    not currently expect to designate any financial assets or
    liabilities for the accounting allowed by SFA No. 159, and
    therefore expects there to be no material impact on adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (revised
    2007),

Business Combinations

(“FAS No. 141
    (revised 2007)”), and FAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) requires an acquirer to measure the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on
    the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over
    the net identifiable assets acquired. This standard also
    requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and
    liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies and
    research and development. FAS No. 160 clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as a
    component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated
    financial statements. Consolidated net income should include the
    net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest
    with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of
    income. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to
    be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. The
    effective date for both statements is for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2008. The adoption of
    FAS No. 141 (revised 2007) is prospective. The
    adoption of FAS No. 160 is prospective. The impact to
    presentation and disclosure are applied retrospectively. We are
    currently in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, that
    the adoption of FAS No. 141 (revised 2007) and
    FAS No. 160 will have on our financial position,
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of
    business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk
    associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt and
    foreign exchange rate risk.

Interest rate risk.

Our investments have
    limited exposure to market risk. To minimize this risk, we
    maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market
    funds and short-term government funds. The interest rates are
    variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because
    of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change
    in market interest rates would not be expected to have a
    material impact on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or
    decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our
    bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. The
    interest rate on our existing bank debt is currently fixed
    except for our U.S. revolving line of credit. The rates on
    our Euro overdraft facilities in Germany and Italy and our
    Japanese Yen overdraft facility are fixed for twelve-month
    periods. Approximately 78% of our outstanding debt had a fixed
    rate of interest as of December 31, 2007. All of our
    U.S. and German term debt was repaid in the first quarter
    of 2007 except for the $20 million of subordinated notes
    issued to our series B stockholders upon completion of our
    IPO. We do not believe that a 10% change in market interest
    rates would have a material impact on our financial position or
    results of operations.

Exchange rates.

Due to our international
    operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of
    sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other
    than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro and the Japanese
    Yen. As a result, our international operations give rise to
    transactional market risk associated with exchange rate
    movements of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the Japanese
    Yen. Gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions are
    reported as a component of general and administrative expense
    and totaled a $1.2 million gain, and a $0.8 million
    loss and a $0.1 million loss for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Changes in
    exchange rates can also affect our financial results. If
    exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2007 had been
    the same as in the previous year, we estimate that our sales
    would have been lower by approximately $7.2 million.
    Additionally, we estimate that cost of sales and operating
    expenses would have been lower by approximately
    $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

During the third quarter of 2007, we entered into a foreign
    currency forward contract, not designated as a hedging
    instrument under SFAS No. 133, to offset certain
    exposures from inter-company loans, receivables and payables. In
    the fourth quarter of 2007, a loss of $0.4 million was
    realized on this foreign currency forward contract when it was
    settled. No derivative instruments were outstanding at
    December 31, 2007. Management believes that the use of
    foreign currency financial instruments reduces the risks of
    certain foreign currency transactions, however, these
    instruments provide only limited protection. We will continue to
    analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and
    may engage in additional financial hedging techniques in the
    future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential
    fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect
    our financial results in the future.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our
    Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the
    period covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,
    our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
    concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
    we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f))

for the Company and its subsidiaries. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
    management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation
    Date based on criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of the Evaluation Date, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited our internal
    control over financial reporting, as stated in their report
    below.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer) does not expect that the disclosure controls
    and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all
    control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of
    fraud, if any, within the company have been or will be detected.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, MA

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated
    March 10, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, convertible
    redeemable preferred stock and stockholders’ equity
    (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
    used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IPG
    Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” effective January 1, 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated March 10, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

NATURE OF
    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Nature of Business

— IPG Photonics Corporation
    (the “Company”) designs and manufactures a broad line
    of high-performance fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers for
    diverse applications in numerous markets, such as materials
    processing, advanced applications, communications and medical.
    The Company’s world headquarters are located in Oxford,
    Massachusetts. The Company also has facilities and sales offices
    elsewhere in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Principles of Consolidation

— The Company was
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1998. The
    accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the
    Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
    transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

— The financial information
    for entities outside the United States is measured using local
    currencies as the functional currency, except for our Russian
    subsidiary, for which the functional currency is deemed to be
    the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the
    respective balance sheet dates. Income and expenses are
    translated into U.S. dollars based on the average rate of
    exchange for the corresponding period. Exchange rate differences
    resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for
    directly as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income except in Russia where translation gains and losses are
    reported in net income. Gains or losses from foreign currency
    transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of
    income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments, such
    as bank deposits, with insignificant interest rate risk and
    original maturities of three months or less at the date of
    acquisition.

Marketable Securities —

Marketable
    securities consist primarily of auction-rate securities.
    Auction-rate securities trade on a shorter term than the
    maturity date of the underlying instrument based on an auction
    bid that resets the interest rate of the security. The auction
    or reset dates occur at intervals of generally less than
    90 days. The Company classifies these investments as
    available for sale as the securities are not held to the
    maturity date of the underlying instrument and the maturity date
    of the underlying instrument is greater than 3 months.
    These securities are carried at fair value.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis. Inventories include parts and components that
    may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence.
    The Company periodically reviews the quantities and carrying
    values of inventories to assess whether the inventories are
    recoverable. The costs associated with provisions for excess
    quantities, technological obsolescence, or component rejection
    are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

— Property,
    plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line
    method based on the estimated useful lives of the related
    assets. In the case of leasehold improvements, the estimated
    useful lives of the related assets do

F-7


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

not exceed the remaining terms of the corresponding leases. The
    following table presents the assigned economic useful lives of
    property, plant, and equipment:

Economic

Category

Useful Life

Buildings

30 years

Machinery and equipment

3-5 years

Office furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Other assets

3-5 years

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations. Interest expense associated with significant capital
    projects is capitalized as a cost of the project. The Company
    capitalized $178,000, $198,000 and $239,000 of interest expense
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

— Long-lived
    assets, which consist primarily of property, plant, and
    equipment, are reviewed by management for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may not be recoverable. In cases in which undiscounted
    expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an
    impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the
    carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. No impairment
    losses have been recorded during the periods presented.

Revenue Recognition

— The Company recognizes
    revenue in accordance with SEC Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 104,

Revenue Recognition

(“SAB No. 104”). SAB No. 104
    requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be
    recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
    rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and
    (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from the
    sale of the Company’s products is generally recognized upon
    shipment, provided that the other revenue recognition criteria
    have been met. The Company has no obligation to provide
    upgrades, enhancements or customer support subsequent to the
    sale, other than warranty.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. The Company defers revenue on multiple element
    arrangements if the fair values of all deliverables are not
    known or if customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of
    specified items or performance conditions and if the performance
    conditions cannot be satisfactorily tested prior to shipment or
    if the Company has not met such conditions in the past.
    Applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied
    separately for each separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. Generally, the Company receives
    a customer purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and
    product shipment terms are free on board (F.O.B.) shipping
    point. Some of our revenue arrangements include customer
    acceptance clauses. Revenue is deferred until customer
    acceptance has been obtained.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company
    maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the
    estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be
    collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer
    creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of
    outstanding receivables.

Warranties

— In general, the Company’s
    products carry a warranty against defect for a period of one to
    three years, depending upon the product type and customer
    negotiations. The expected cost associated with these warranty
    obligations is recorded when the revenue is recognized. Warranty
    costs and related accrued warranty costs were not significant
    for the periods presented.

Advertising Expense

— The cost of advertising
    is expensed as incurred. The Company conducts substantially all
    of its sales and marketing efforts through trade shows,
    professional and technical conferences, direct sales and use of
    its website. The Company’s advertising costs were not
    significant for the periods presented.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net
    operating loss carryforwards and credits using enacted rates in
    effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
    allowances are provided against deferred tax assets that are not
    deemed to be recoverable. The Company recognizes tax positions
    that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
    by relevant tax authorities. The tax positions are measured at
    the greatest amount of tax benefit that is more than
    50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to
    various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and
    other issues. Prior to 2007, these reserves were recorded when
    management determined that it was probable that a loss would be
    incurred related to these matters and the amount of the loss was
    reasonably determinable. In 2007, the Company adopted the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes

(“FIN No. 48”). As a
    result, reserves recorded subsequent to adoption are based on a
    determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by
    the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than
    not to be realized following resolution of any potential
    contingencies present related to the tax benefit, assuming that
    the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities.
    Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain
    tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk
    consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
    securities and accounts receivable. The Company maintains
    substantially all of its cash and marketable securities in four
    financial institutions, which are

F-9


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

believed to be high-credit, quality financial institutions. The
    Company grants credit to customers in the ordinary course of
    business and provides a reserve for potential credit losses.
    Such losses historically have been within management’s
    expectations (see discussion related to significant customers in
    Note 14).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The
    Company’s financial instruments consist of marketable
    securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term
    debt. The current carrying amounts of such instruments are
    considered reasonable estimates of their fair market value, due
    to the short maturity of these instruments or as a result of the
    competitive market interest rates, which have been negotiated.

Comprehensive Income

— Comprehensive income
    includes charges and credits to equity that are not the result
    of transactions with stockholders. Included in other
    comprehensive income for the Company is the cumulative
    translation adjustment. These adjustments are accumulated within
    the consolidated statements of convertible redeemable preferred
    stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit) under accumulated
    other comprehensive income.

Derivative Instruments

— The Company has
    historically entered into financial instruments that constitute
    freestanding derivative instruments. The Company accounts for
    these arrangements in accordance with the FASB’s Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

(“SFAS No. 133”), as
    well as related interpretations. Derivative instruments are
    recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheets
    and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized
    in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the
    nature of the derivative. The Company determines the fair value
    of derivative instruments based on available market data using
    appropriate valuation models, giving consideration to all of the
    rights and obligations of each instrument.

The Company occasionally enters into a financial instrument that
    contains a derivative instrument that is embedded in the
    financial instrument. Upon entering into the instrument, the
    Company assesses (i) whether the economic characteristics
    of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to
    the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the
    financial instrument (i.e. the host contract), (ii) whether
    a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded
    instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument
    and (iii) whether the instrument is indexed to the
    Company’s own stock and would be classified in
    stockholders’ equity. When it is determined that
    (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic
    characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the
    economic characteristics of the host contract, (2) a
    separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
    derivative instrument or (3) the embedded derivative is not
    indexed to the Company’s own stock or would be classified
    outside of stockholders’ equity, the embedded derivative is
    separated from the host contract and carried at fair value.

Beneficial Conversion

— When the Company issues
    debt or equity that is convertible into common stock at a
    discount from the common stock fair value at the date the debt
    or equity is issued, a beneficial conversion feature for the
    difference between the fair value and the conversion price
    multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion is
    recorded as a beneficial conversion charge or deemed dividend.
    The beneficial conversion feature is presented as a discount to
    the related debt or a deemed dividend to the related equity
    holders, with an offsetting amount increasing additional paid-in
    capital.

Business Segment Information

— SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about
    Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

(“SFAS No. 131”), establishes standards
    for reporting information about operating segments. The Company
    is structured with ten distinct legal entities in nine different
    countries; however, the Company operates in one segment as each
    of its legal entities have similar economic characteristics and
    each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in
    SFAS No. 131. All of the Company’s operations
    involve the design, development, production and distribution of
    fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and related optical components.
    As disclosed in Note 14, the Company monitors and maintains
    information on the sale of its products into its various end
    markets, including (i) materials processing,
    (ii) advanced applications, (iii) telecommunications
    and (iv) medical, but the Company does not maintain
    separate operating financial information for these

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

end markets or on any other basis. The Company’s product
    lines, customer base and manufacturing processes are similar
    throughout the world, with little distinction between legal
    entity or product end market. The Company has a single,
    company-wide management team that administers all properties as
    a whole rather than as discrete operating segments. The chief
    decision maker, who is the company’s Chief Executive
    Officer, measures financial performance as a single enterprise
    and not on legal entity or end-market basis. Throughout the
    year, the chief decision maker allocates capital resources on a

project-by-project

basis across the Company’s entire asset base to maximize
    profitability without regard to legal entity or end-market basis.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

— In July
    2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, which prescribes a
    recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in
    the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and
    transitions. FIN No. 48 became effective for the
    Company beginning January 1, 2007. Adoption did not have a
    material impact on the financial statements. See Note 13.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157
    provides a single definition of fair value, along with a
    framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure
    about using fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value measurement is
    market-based, not entity-specific, and establishes a fair value
    hierarchy in which the highest priority is quoted prices in
    active markets. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value
    measurements are disclosed according to their level within this
    hierarchy. While SFAS No. 157 does not add any new
    fair value measurements, it does change current practice in
    certain ways, including requiring entities to include their own
    credit standing when measuring their liabilities.
    SFAS No. 157 was initially effective for the
    Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008.
    However, in February 2008, the FASB decided that an entity need
    not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    nonrecurring basis until the subsequent year. Accordingly, the
    Company’s adoption of this standard on January 1, 2008
    is limited to financial assets and liabilities. The Company does
    not believe the initial adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
    have a material effect on its financial condition or results of
    operations. However, the Company is still in the process of
    evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities and therefore has not yet
    determined the impact that it will have on its financial
    statements upon full adoption.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS No. 159”), which provides
    companies with an option to report selected financial assets and
    liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 also
    establishes presentation and disclosure requirements relating to
    the use of fair values within the financial statements. The
    provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective for the
    Company beginning after January 1, 2008. The Company does
    not currently expect to designate any financial assets or
    liabilities for the accounting allowed by SFAS No. 159, and
    therefore expects there to be no material impact on adoption.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 141 (revised
    2007),

Business Combinations

(“FAS No. 141
    (revised 2007)”), and FAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51

(“FAS No. 160”). FAS No. 141
    (revised 2007) requires an acquirer to measure the
    identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on
    the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over
    the net identifiable assets acquired. This standard also
    requires the fair value measurement of certain other assets and
    liabilities related to the acquisition such as contingencies and
    research and development. FAS No. 160 clarifies that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as a
    component of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated
    financial statements. Consolidated net income should include the
    net income for both the parent and the noncontrolling interest
    with disclosure of both amounts on the consolidated statement of
    income. The calculation of earnings per share will continue to
    be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. The
    effective date for both

statements is for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The adoption of FAS No. 141 (revised
    2007) is prospective. The adoption of FAS No. 160
    is prospective. The impact to presentation and disclosure are
    applied retrospectively. We are currently in the process of
    evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of
    FAS No. 141 (revised 2007) and
    FAS No. 160 will have on our financial position,
    consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”).
    SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based
    awards exchanged for employee’s services and other
    stock-based transactions. For the years prior to January 1,
    2006, the Company elected to account for stock-based
    compensation awarded to employees and directors using the
    intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
    Issued to Employees

. Accordingly, for financial reporting
    purposes, compensation cost for stock options granted to
    employees and directors was measured as the excess, if any, of
    the estimated fair market value of the Company’s stock at
    the deemed measurement date over the amount an employee or
    director must pay to acquire the stock.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the
    prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation
    costs recorded during 2007 and 2006 include:
    (a) compensation costs for all share-based payment awards
    granted or modified prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the intrinsic value in accordance
    with the original provisions of APB 25; and
    (b) compensation costs for all share-based payment awards
    granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the
    grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The Company allocates
    and records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period.

Under SFAS No. 123(R), the Company calculates the fair
    value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes
    option-pricing model. Determining the appropriate fair value
    model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment
    awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions,
    including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards
    and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating
    the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent
    management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve
    inherent uncertainties and the application of management
    judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses
    different assumptions, the Company’s stock-based
    compensation expense could be materially different in the
    future. The weighted average assumptions used in the
    Black-Scholes model were 6.25 years for the expected term,
    65% for the expected volatility, and 0% for dividend yield for
    the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The weighted
    average risk-free rate was 4.51% and 4.75% for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

F-12


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted average expected option term reflects the
    application of the simplified method set forth in Securities and
    Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 107. The simplified method defines the life as the
    average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted
    average vesting period for all option tranches.

Because the Company’s common stock has been publicly traded
    since December 2006, there is a lack of sufficient
    company-specific historical and implied volatility information.
    The Company based its estimate of expected volatility on the
    expected volatility of similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available. The Company used the following factors to
    identify similar public entities: industry, stage of life cycle,
    size and profitability. The Company intends to continue to
    consistently apply this process using the same or similar
    entities until a sufficient amount of historical information
    regarding the volatility of its own share price becomes
    available, or unless circumstances change such that the
    identified entities are no longer similar to the Company. In
    this latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share
    prices are publicly available would be utilized in the
    calculation.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated
    at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
    stock-based compensation recorded for 2007 and 2006 reflects an
    estimated forfeiture rate of 5%.

In accordance with the prospective transition method, the
    Company’s financial statements for prior periods have not
    been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of
    SFAS No. 123(R). If the compensation costs for options
    awarded to employees and directors had been determined and
    accounted for using the fair value method, the recorded net
    income in 2005 would not have been materially different than
    that reported.

Incentive Plans

— In April 2000, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the 2000 Incentive
    Compensation Plan, or 2000 plan, and in February 2006, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the 2006 Incentive
    Compensation Plan, or 2006 plan, which provide for the issuance
    of stock options and other stock and non-stock based awards to
    the Company’s directors, employees, consultants and
    advisors. The Company reserved 5,833,333 shares under the
    2000 plan and 4,000,000 shares under the 2006 plan for the
    issuance of awards under the plans. In June 2006, the
    Company’s board of directors adopted the Non-Employee
    Directors Stock Plan (the “Directors Plan”). Only
    non-employee directors are eligible to receive awards under the
    Directors Plan. The Company reserved 166,666 shares for
    issuance under the Directors Plan. Under the three plans, the
    Company may grant nonstatutory stock options at an exercise
    price at least equal to the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant, unless the
    board of directors or compensation committee determines
    otherwise on the date of grant. Incentive stock options may be
    granted under the 2000 plan and the 2006 plan at exercise prices
    equal to or exceeding the fair market value of the common stock
    on the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over
    periods of two to five years and expire seven to ten years from
    the date of the grant. The awards under the 2000 plan and the
    2006 plan may become exercisable earlier upon the occurrence of
    certain change of control events at the election of the board of
    directors or compensation committee, and all awards under the
    Directors Plan automatically become exercisable upon a change of
    control. At December 31, 2007, 2,878,913 shares were
    available for future grant under the three option plans.

    December 31, 2007). This amount is available through
    September 2008. This facility bears interest at market rates
    that vary depending upon the bank within the syndicate that
    advances the principal outstanding (6.95% at December 31,
    2007). This facility is collateralized by a common pool of the
    assets of the Company’s German subsidiary, IPG Laser GmbH.

Other European Facilities —

In October 2007,
    the Company entered into a new unsecured revolving line of
    credit with a principal amount of Euro 15,000,000
    (approximately $22,078,000 at December 31, 2007). The
    credit facility bears interest at various rates based upon the
    type of loan and matures in June 2010.

The Company also maintains two Euro credit lines in Italy with

    to 1.2% depending on the Company’s financial performance
    (6.2% at December 31, 2007). The line of credit also allows
    for drawdowns by certain subsidiaries. At December 31,
    2007, the remaining availability under the U.S. Line of
    Credit totaled $8,917,000. The Company also has the option to

CONVERTIBLE
    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND
    WARRANTS

Authorized Capital

—  The Company has
    authorized capital stock consisting of 175,000,000 shares
    of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and
    5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per
    share. There are currently no shares of preferred stock
    outstanding.

Initial Public Offering

— The Company received
    proceeds of $93.2 million, net of expenses, from its
    issuance and sale of 6,241,379 shares of common stock in
    December 2006.

Preferred Stock

— There are no shares of
    preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2007 or
    2006. Upon the Company’s initial public offering in
    December 2006, 488,000 outstanding shares of Series A
    convertible preferred stock (the “Series A”)
    converted into 359,463 shares of common stock, 3,800,000
    outstanding shares of Series B convertible redeemable
    preferred stock (the “Series B”) converted into
    7,252,927 shares of common stock and $20.0 million
    principal amount of subordinated promissory notes, and 2,684,211
    outstanding shares of Series D convertible redeemable
    preferred stock (the “Series D”) converted into
    1,683,168 shares of common stock.

The rights and preferences of the preferred stock prior to their
    conversion in December 2006 were as follows:

Dividends

—  The holders of the Series A,
    Series B, and Series D were not entitled to dividends
    at any fixed rate, but were entitled to receive dividends at the
    rate paid, if any, on the common shares.

Liquidation

— In the event of any voluntary or
    involuntary liquidation or dissolution of the Company, each
    holder of the Series A, Series B, and Series D
    was entitled to be paid, before any

F-17


IPG

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

distributions were made to the common stockholders or other
    junior stockholders, a liquidation preference.

The holders of the Series A, Series B, and
    Series D were entitled to be paid an amount equal to the
    preference value of $10.00, $25.00 and $1.90 per share,
    respectively, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid dividends.
    In addition, the holders of the Series B would have
    participated in further distributions available for the common
    shares in the amount that would have been payable per share if
    the Series B had been converted to common shares.

Voting Rights

— The holders of Series A
    were not entitled to vote on any matters other than these
    affecting the rights and preferences of their shares. The
    holders of the Series B and Series D were entitled to
    vote on matters with holders of common shares in an amount equal
    to the number of common shares into which the Series B and
    Series D were then convertible.

Redemption

— Prior to their conversion into
    common stock, the holders of Series B and Series D had
    redemption rights. The Series B was being accreted to its
    redemption value through the redemption dates. Accretion totaled
    $0, $1,994,000 and $2,351,000 for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Conversion

— The Series A, Series B
    and Series D were convertible into the number of shares of
    common stock of the Company determined by dividing their
    respective preference values by their respective conversion
    values then in effect. The preference values of the
    Series A, Series B and Series D were $10.00,
    $25.00 and $1.90 per share, respectively, and the conversion
    values at the time of their conversion were $14.27, $33.83 and
    $3.03 per share, respectively. In December 2005 and January
    2006, the conversion rights and obligations of the Series B
    and Series A, respectively, were amended to modify their
    automatic conversion right into common shares upon public
    offerings that met specific conditions.

Upon a public offering meeting certain conditions, all
    Series A automatically converted into common stock at the
    lower of the conversion price then in effect or the offering
    price to the public.

Upon a “qualified public offering” meeting certain
    conditions, all Series B automatically converted into
    subordinated debt and common shares. One of the conditions was
    that the Company repurchase all of the warrants to purchase its
    common stock that were granted to the holders of the
    Series B. In a qualified public offering, the holders of
    the Series B received consideration equal to the greater of
    (A) what the holders of the Series B would have
    received if the Company were sold to a third party using the
    public offering price to compute the total sale price, which
    amount would have included the liquidation preference of the
    Series B plus an additional participation amount, as set
    forth in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, and
    (B) what the holders of the Series B would have
    received if it converted upon the public offering at $15.00 per
    share. The Company’s initial public offering in December
    2006 met the conditions for a qualified public offering and the
    holders of the Series B received, upon conversion of their
    shares, consideration consisting of subordinated three-year
    notes totaling $20,000,000 in principal amount and the remainder
    in the form of the Company’s common stock valued at $16.50
    per share, the offering price to the public.

Because of the anti-dilution provision in the Series A and
    Series B, as a result of the initial public offering, the
    Company recorded a deemed dividend related to the beneficial
    conversion of the Series A and Series B of $63,000 and
    $18,204,000, respectively. The deemed dividend was recorded to
    give effect to the additional shares issued to the holders of
    Series A and Series B.

Warrants

— In connection with the issuance of
    the Series B, the Company issued Series B Warrants to
    purchase, in the aggregate, $47,500,000 of the Company’s
    common stock at an equivalent per-share price of 50% of the fair
    value on the date of an initial public offering of common stock
    or the sale, merger or liquidation of the Company. The Company
    repurchased all of the Series B Warrants in connection with
    its initial public offering in December 2006 for $22,087,000.
    The Series B Warrants constituted freestanding

F-18


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

derivatives that were accounted for as liabilities at fair
    value. The Series B Warrants were a binary financial
    instrument with a fair value of either $23,750,000 if the
    Series B Warrants were exercised prior to their expiration
    or zero if the term of the Series B Warrants expired before
    they were exercised. At each balance sheet date, the fair value
    of the Series B Warrants was estimated by the Company by
    assessing the probability that the Series B Warrants would
    be exercised prior to their expiration. To calculate the
    estimated fair value, the determined probability percentage was
    multiplied by the total potential value of the Series B
    Warrants. A discount relating to the time value of money was
    applied to the estimated value if the Series B Warrants
    were not expected to be exercised within twelve months. As
    freestanding derivative instruments, changes in fair value of
    the Series B Warrants were recognized in earnings and
    reported as other income (expense). For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of the
    Series B Warrants increased by $7,443,500 and $745,000,
    respectively.

Notes Receivable From Issuances of Shares

— The
    Company received notes from an individual in connection with
    this individual’s exercise of 126,667 nonqualified stock
    options in March 2000, as well as the issuance of
    166,667 shares of common stock in connection with
    professional services. This individual later became a member of
    the Company’s Board of Directors. The notes receivable had
    principal balances of $190,000 and $250,000, accruing interest
    at 1.68% and 1.52%, respectively, and were collateralized by
    326,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. The
    loans were repaid in 2006.

Minority Interests

— Minority interests
    reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
    consist of the 20% of Fibertech held by the management of
    Fibertech; 41.4% of NTO IRE-POLUS, Russia (“NTO”) held
    by the company’s chief executive officer, certain other
    Company employees and other parties; 20% of IPG Photonics
    (Japan) Ltd., Japan (“IPG Japan”) held by the
    Company’s Japanese distributor; and 10% of IPG Photonics
    (Korea) (“IPG Korea”) held by the management of IPG
    Korea. During 2005, the minority stockholders of IPG Korea and
    IPG Japan contributed a total of $11,000 in capital in
    connection with the formation of those companies. During 2007,
    the minority stockholder of IPG Korea contributed an additional
    $36,000. Also during 2007, the Company purchased the interests
    of certain minority stockholders of NTO, who collectively owned
    7.6%, for $596,000, which approximated the book value of the
    minority interests.

RELATED-PARTY
    TRANSACTIONS

At December 31, 2005, the Company’s chief executive
    officer and two members of the Company’s Board of Directors
    owed the Company $5,026,000, $504,811 and $179,000,
    respectively, under interest-bearing promissory notes. Interest
    on such loans totaled $49,000 and $83,000 in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. These loans and accrued interest were repaid in
    full in July and August 2006.

Through July 2006, IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd.
    (“IPFD”), an entity that is controlled by the
    Company’s chief executive officer and other management,
    provided the Company with a revolving credit facility. At
    December 31, 2005, the outstanding amount was $4,686,000.
    Interest expense on the IPFD credit facility totaled $94,000 and
    $161,000 during 2006 and 2005, respectively. In July 2006, IPFD
    purchased from the Company’s chief executive officer
    770,670 shares of the Company’s common stock in
    exchange for $357,000 in cash and $4.6 million in the form
    of the assignment of the amounts due under the IPFD credit
    facility. Simultaneously, the Company exchanged with the chief
    executive officer the note due from him with a remaining
    principal amount of $5.0 million for $357,000 in cash and
    $4.6 million in the form of the assignment of amounts due
    under the IPFD credit facility. Consequently, the IPFD credit
    facility and the note receivable from the chief executive
    officer were fully repaid and were no longer outstanding at
    December 31, 2006.

From November 2004 to August 2006, the Company’s chief
    executive officer provided a personal guarantee for a
    U.S. credit facility that has since been repaid. In
    consideration of the personal guarantee, the Company paid him a
    guarantee fee equal to the interest on his loan from the Company
    (with a tax

while the credit facility was outstanding. The guarantee fee was
    $71,000 and $136,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

At December 31, 2005, there was a $560,000 note payable to
    IPFD from NTO. Interest expense, accruing at 4.4% annually, for
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, totaled $9,000
    and $25,000, respectively, and was included in the carrying
    value of the note. This note was repaid in full in May 2006.

The Company leases office space from IPFD and reimburses IPFD
    for general and administrative expenses. The costs related to
    the lease and services totaled $116,000, $115,000 and $116,000
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In April 2006, a director of one of the Company’s existing
    customers joined the Company’s board of directors. Sales to
    this customer totaled $10,296,000, $10,366,000 and $7,007,000
    for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company paid $252,000, $181,000 and $191,000 to an entity
    controlled by the father of the Company’s chief financial
    officer in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The amounts
    included payments for consulting services, commissions and
    reimbursement of expenses.

NET

Participating Securities and the Two —
    Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128

(“EITF 03-6”),

which established standards regarding the computation of net
    income per share by companies that have issued securities other
    than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to
    participate in dividends and earnings of the company.

EITF 03-6

requires earnings available to common stockholders for the
    period, after deduction of preferred stock accretion and deemed
    dividends related to beneficial conversion features, to be
    allocated between the common and convertible securities based on
    their respective rights to receive dividends. Basic net income
    per share is then calculated by dividing income applicable to
    common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares
    outstanding. The Company’s preferred stock does not
    participate in losses, and therefore is not included in the
    computation of net loss per share, as applicable.

EITF 03-6

does not require the presentation of basic and diluted net
    income per share for securities other than common stock;
    therefore, the following per share amounts only pertain to the
    Company’s common stock.

The Company calculates diluted net income per share under the
    if-converted method unless the conversion of the convertible
    preferred stock is dilutive to basic net income per share. To
    the extent convertible preferred stock is dilutive, the Company
    calculates diluted net income per share under the two-class
    method to include the effect of potential common shares.

In November 2006, the Company was sued for patent infringement
    relating to certain unspecified fiber amplifier products. The
    plaintiff has made a complaint for damages of over
    $10 million, treble damages for alleged willful
    infringement and injunctive relief. The case is in the discovery

    unspecified damages, treble damages for alleged willful
    infringement and injunctive relief. The patent asserted in the
    lawsuit expired in April 2007. The Company believes it has
    meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously contest the
    claims. As such, no amounts have been accrued in respect to this
    contingency.

The (provision for) benefit from income taxes is different from
    that which would be obtained by applying the statutory federal
    income tax rate to income before income taxes due to the effects
    of income taxed at different rates in different jurisdictions,
    state income taxes, tax credits, various permanent items and
    changes in the valuation allowance that has been provided
    against the net operating losses that are not deemed to be
    recoverable. In 2006, the Company determined that it was more
    likely than not that a benefit would be realized from the
    domestic deferred tax assets and released $13,060,000 related to
    the valuation allowance in addition to a favorable change of
    $4,620,000 resulting from the use of net operating losses in
    2006. The favorable changes to the valuation allowance in 2005
    reflect the actual net operating losses utilized. In 2007, the
    provision for income taxes was affected by a change in valuation
    of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a
    reduction in enacted tax rates in Germany. Additionally, there
    was a change in certain U.S. deferred tax assets and
    liabilities as a result of a change in estimated state tax rates.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has U.S. federal
    and state tax net operating loss carryforwards available for
    future periods of approximately $19,500,000 and $10,500,000,
    respectively. The federal and state tax net operating loss
    carryforwards begin expiring in 2022 and 2008, respectively.
    Approximately $13,000,000 of the federal net operating loss
    carryforward when utilized will be credited to paid in capital
    when realized.

In 2007, the company adopted the provisions of FASB
    FIN No. 48. The effect of adoption on the results of
    operations and financial condition of the Company as of and for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 was not material. As of
    December 31, 2007, the Company had $865,000 of unrecognized
    tax benefits. If recognized, all of the Company’s
    unrecognized tax benefits would be recorded as a component of
    income tax expense. Estimated penalties and interest related to
    the underpayment of income taxes are $179,000 for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and are included as a component of the
    provision for income taxes.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are related to tax
    years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing
    authorities. Open tax years by major jurisdiction are:

•

United States

2002 — 2007

•

Germany

2003 — 2007
