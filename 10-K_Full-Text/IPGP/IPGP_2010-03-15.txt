PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Our
    Company

IPG Photonics Corporation (“IPG,” the
    “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we”,
    “us” or “our”) was incorporated in Delaware
    in 1998. We are the leading developer and manufacturer of a
    broad line of high-performance fiber lasers for diverse
    applications in numerous markets. Fiber lasers are a new
    generation of lasers that combine the advantages of
    semiconductor diodes, such as long life and high efficiency,
    with the high amplification and precise beam qualities of
    specialty optical fibers to deliver superior performance,
    reliability and usability.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, advanced,
    communications and medical applications. We sell our products
    globally to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system
    integrators and end users. We market our products
    internationally primarily through our direct sales force and
    also through agreements with independent sales representatives
    and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States,
    Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, China, South
    Korea, Singapore, India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated. We design and manufacture most key
    components used in our finished products, including
    semiconductor diodes, optical fiber preforms and cables,
    finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. Our vertically integrated
    operations allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, ensure access
    to critical components, rapidly develop and integrate advanced
    products and protect our proprietary technology.

Industry
    Background

Conventional
    Laser Technologies

Since the laser was invented over 50 years ago, laser
    technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and
    products in various industries, including automotive, medical,
    research, consumer products,



electronics, semiconductors and communications. Lasers provide
    flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat
    various materials. They are widely used to transmit large
    volumes of data in optical communications systems, in various
    medical applications and in test and measurement systems. For a
    wide variety of applications, lasers provide superior
    performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser
    technologies.

Lasers emit an intense light beam that can be focused on a small
    area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or
    change their character. These properties are utilized in
    applications requiring very high-power densities, such as
    marking, printing, welding, cutting and other materials
    processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and
    inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light
    to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in
    medical and sensing applications. A laser works by converting
    electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy
    source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the
    energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles
    of light, called photons, at a particular wavelength. Lasers are
    used as an energy or light source for various applications. They
    are also incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other
    systems by OEMs, system integrators and end users.

Historically,
    CO


gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser
    types used in materials processing and many other applications.
    They are named for the materials used to create the lasing
    action. A
    CO


laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled
    tube. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp, or
    diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The
    most common crystal lasers use yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG)
    crystals infused with neodymium or ytterbium.

Introduction
    of Fiber Lasers

Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to
    pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth
    ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable
    in diameter to a human hair. The laser emission is created
    within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible optical
    fiber cable. As a result of their different design and
    components, fiber lasers are more reliable, efficient, robust
    and portable, and easier to operate than conventional lasers. In
    addition, fiber lasers free the end users from fine mechanical
    adjustments and the high maintenance costs that are typical for
    conventional lasers.

Although low-power fiber lasers have existed for approximately
    four decades, their increased recent adoption has been driven
    primarily by our improvements in their performance, increases in
    output power levels and decreased costs including technological
    improvements in optical components such as active fibers that
    have increased their power capacities and resulted in overall
    performance improvements in fiber lasers. Fiber lasers now offer
    output powers that exceed those of conventional lasers in many
    categories. Also, semiconductor diodes historically have
    represented the majority of the cost of fiber lasers. The high
    cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could not compete with
    conventional lasers on price and limited their use to high
    value-added applications. Over the last several years, however,
    our semiconductor diodes have become more affordable and
    reliable due, in part, to substantial advancements in
    semiconductor diode technology and increased production volumes.
    As a result, the average cost per watt of output power has
    decreased dramatically over the last decade. Because of these
    improvements, our fiber lasers can now effectively compete with
    conventional lasers over a wide range of output powers and
    applications. As a pioneer in the development and
    commercialization of fiber lasers, we have contributed to many
    advancements in fiber laser technology and products.

Advantages
    of Fiber Lasers over Conventional Lasers

We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits
    that include:

•

Superior Performance.

Fiber lasers provide
    high beam quality over the entire power range. In most
    conventional laser solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to
    output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is
    virtually non-divergent over a wide power range, meaning the
    beam can be focused to achieve high levels of precision,
    increased power densities and greater distances over which
    processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and
    greater intensity of a fiber laser’s beam allow tasks to be
    accomplished rapidly and with lower-power units than comparable
    conventional lasers.



•

Lower Total Cost of Ownership.

Fiber lasers
    offer strong value to customers because of their generally lower
    total operating costs due to their lower required maintenance
    costs, high reliability and energy efficiency. The initial
    purchase price for fiber lasers is generally below that of YAG
    lasers and comparable to that of conventional
    CO


lasers.
    Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy
    approximately 2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped
    YAG lasers, approximately 3 times more efficiently than
    conventional
    CO


lasers and approximately 15 to 30 times more efficiently than
    lamp-pumped YAG lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more
    energy-efficient and place lower levels of thermal stress on
    their internal components, they have substantially lower cooling
    requirements compared to those of conventional lasers and lower
    or no maintenance costs.

•

Ease of Use.

Many features of fiber lasers
    make them easier to operate, maintain and integrate into
    laser-based systems as compared to conventional lasers.

•

Compact Size and Portability.

Fiber lasers are
    typically smaller and lighter in weight than conventional
    lasers, saving valuable floor space. While conventional lasers
    are delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber
    lasers are more durable and able to perform in variable
    environments.

•

Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of
    Beam.

The design of fiber lasers generally
    provides a broad range of wavelength choices, allowing users to
    select the precise wavelength that best matches their
    application and materials.

Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many
    of the same components, such as semiconductor diodes and
    specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same
    advantages in the applications that require amplification.

Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there
    remain applications and processes where conventional laser
    technologies may provide superior performance with respect to
    particular features. For example, crystal lasers can provide
    higher peak power pulses and fiber lasers do not generate the
    deep ultraviolet light that is used for photolithography in many
    semiconductor applications. In addition,
    CO


lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many
    non-metallic materials, including plastics.

Our
    Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key strengths and competitive advantages
    include the following:

Differentiated Proprietary Technology
    Platform.

At the core of our products is our
    proprietary pumping technology platform that allows our products
    to have higher output powers and superior beam quality than are
    achievable through other techniques. Our technology platform is
    modular, scalable, robust and electrically efficient.

As a pioneer and
    technology leader in fiber lasers, we have built leading
    positions in our various end markets with a large and diverse
    customer base. Based on our leadership positions, we are driving
    the proliferation of fiber lasers in existing and new
    applications.

Breadth and Depth of Expertise.

Since the
    founding of our company in 1990, our core business has been
    developing, designing, manufacturing and marketing advanced
    fiber lasers and amplifiers. We have extensive know-how in
    materials sciences, which enables us to make our specialty
    optical fibers, semiconductor diodes and other critical
    components.

Vertically Integrated Development and
    Manufacturing.

We develop and manufacture all of
    our key specialty components, including semiconductor diodes,
    active fibers, passive fibers and specialty optical components.
    Our proprietary components are capable of handling the stress of
    the high optical powers from our products and we believe many of
    them exceed the performance of commercially available
    components. We believe that our vertical integration enhances
    our ability to meet customer requirements, accelerate
    development, manage costs and improve component yields, all
    while maintaining high performance and quality standards.

Broad Product Portfolio and Ability to Meet Customer
    Requirements.

We offer a broad range of standard
    and custom fiber lasers and amplifiers that operate between 1
    and 2 microns. Our vertically integrated manufacturing and broad
    technology expertise enable us to design, prototype and commence
    high-volume production of our products rapidly, allowing our
    customers to meet their

time-to-market

requirements.

Our
    Strategy

Our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership position
    by pursuing the following key elements of our strategy:

Leverage Our Technology to Gain Market
    Share.

As fiber lasers become more widely
    accepted, we plan to continue to leverage our brand and position
    as the leader in developing and commercializing fiber lasers to
    increase our position in the broader market. Our lasers continue
    to displace conventional lasers in numerous low and mid-power
    materials processing applications, such as marking, engraving
    and printing. Our high-power lasers also have been penetrating
    several applications that use conventional lasers, such as
    welding and cutting of metal parts.

Target New Applications for Lasers.

We intend
    to continue to enable and penetrate additional applications
    where lasers have not traditionally been used. We believe that
    fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that
    have hindered the adoption of conventional lasers. We target
    applications where higher power, portability, efficiency, size
    and flexible fiber cable delivery can lead customers to adopt
    fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. Examples of such
    targeted new applications include cutting of high strength steel
    alloys and high-speed welding for automobiles.

Expand Our Product Portfolio.

We continue to
    invest in research and development to add additional
    wavelengths, power levels and other parameters while also
    improving beam quality. In 2009, we introduced a line of
    complementary products used with our fiber lasers, including
    high-power couplers, beam switches and optical beam delivery
    cables, high-power packaged diodes, long-pulse high peak power
    fiber lasers and a pulsed green fiber laser. In January 2010, we
    acquired a producer of active and passive laser materials and
    tunable lasers for scientific, biomedical, technological and
    eye-safe range-finding applications.

Optimize Our Manufacturing Capabilities.

We
    plan to seek further increases in the automation of our
    component manufacturing processes and device assembly to improve
    component yields and increase the power outputs and capacities
    of the various components that we make. We intend to leverage
    our technology and operations expertise to manufacture
    additional components in order to reduce costs, ensure component
    quality and ensure supply. In 2009, we started to sell our
    internally manufactured beam switches, optical beam delivery
    cables and high-power couplers to reduce our costs and improve
    our margins. Moreover, we are redesigning the electronics of our
    low and mid-power products to simplify manufacturing, improve
    quality and decrease costs. These initiatives, in addition to
    optimizing our manufacturing capabilities and maintaining
    efficient labor costs, are intended to improve margins.

Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers
    Worldwide.

In 2009, more than 75% of our sales
    came from international customers. We intend to capitalize on
    and grow our global customer base by opening new application
    development centers as well as sales and service offices in
    Russia, Asia, Europe and the United States. Last year, we
    expanded our application and development center in
    Massachusetts, and we opened a new sales office and an
    application development center in California and a new sales
    office in France.

Products

We design and manufacture a broad range of high-performance
    optical fiber-based lasers and amplifiers. We also make packaged
    diodes, direct diode laser systems and communications systems
    that utilize our optical fiber-based products. Many of our
    products are designed to be used as general purpose energy or
    light sources, making them useful in diverse applications and
    markets.



Our products are based on a common proprietary technology
    platform using many of the same core components, such as
    semiconductor diodes and specialty fibers, which we configure to
    our customers’ specifications. Our engineers and scientists
    work closely with OEMs and end users to develop and customize
    our products for their needs. Because of our flexible and
    modular product architecture, we offer products in different
    configurations according to the desired application, including
    modules, rack-mounted units and tabletop units. Our engineers
    and other technical experts work directly with the customer in
    our application and development centers to develop and configure
    the optimal solution for each customer’s manufacturing
    requirements. We also make complementary products and components
    that are used with our ultra-high power products, such as fiber
    couplers, beam switches, optical beam delivery cables and
    chillers. In addition, we make marking systems for sale in India
    and China.

Lasers

Our laser products include low (1 to 99 watts), medium (100 to
    999 watts) and high (1,000 watts and above) output power lasers
    from 0.5 to 2 microns in wavelength. These lasers either may be
    continuous wave (CW) or may be modulated at different rates. We
    offer several different types of lasers, which are defined by
    the type of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium,
    thulium and Raman. We also sell fiber pigtailed packaged diodes
    and fiber coupled direct diode laser systems that use
    semiconductor diodes rather than optical fibers as their gain
    medium. In addition, we offer high-energy pulsed lasers,
    multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers, single-polarization and
    single-frequency lasers, as well as other versions of our
    products.

We believe that we produce the highest power solid-state lasers
    in the industry. Our ytterbium fiber lasers reach power levels
    up of to 50,000 watts. We also make single-mode output ytterbium
    fiber lasers with power levels of up to 10,000 watts and
    single-mode output erbium and thulium fiber lasers with power
    levels of up to 400 watts. Our compact, durable design and
    integrated fiber optic beam delivery allows us to offer
    versatile laser energy sources and simple laser integration for
    complex production processes without compromising quality, speed
    or power.

We also sell laser diode chips and packaged laser diodes
    operating at 9XX nanometers. Recently, we started to sell our
    own family of high power optical fiber delivery cables, fiber
    couplers, beam switches, chillers and other accessories for our
    fiber lasers.

Amplifiers

Our amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to 1,500
    watts of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We
    offer erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, commonly called EDFAs,
    Raman amplifiers and integrated communications systems that
    incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly
    deployed in broadband networks and dense wavelength division
    multiplexing, or DWDM, networks such as fiber to the home
    (FTTH), fiber to the curb (FTTC), and passive optical networks
    (PON). We also offer ytterbium and thulium specialty fiber
    amplifiers and broadband light sources that are used in advanced
    applications. In addition, we sell single-frequency, linearly
    polarized and polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier
    products. As with our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer
    some of the highest output power levels and highest number of
    optical outputs in the industry. We believe our line of fiber
    amplifiers offers the best commercially available output power
    and performance.

In January 2010, we completed the acquisition of Photonics
    Innovations, Inc., a maker of active and passive laser materials
    and tunable lasers for scientific, biomedical, technological,
    and eye-safe range-finding applications. The acquisition allows
    us to expand our product offerings to the middle infrared region
    (approximately 2 to 5 microns).

Materials
    Processing

The most significant materials processing applications for fiber
    lasers are marking, printing, welding and cutting. Other
    applications include micromachining, surface treatment,
    drilling, soldering, annealing, rapid prototyping and
    laser-assisted machining.

Marking, Engraving and Printing
    Applications.

With the increasing need for source
    traceability, component identification and product tracking as a
    means of reducing product liability and preventing
    falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic
    production systems, industrial manufacturers are increasingly
    demanding marking systems capable of applying serialized
    alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto
    their manufactured components. Laser engraving is similar to
    marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to
    conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can
    mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as
    ceramic, glass and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without
    contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by
    engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a
    customer’s production process and do not subject the item
    being marked to mechanical stress.

In the semiconductor industry, lasers typically are used to mark
    wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry,
    lasers typically are used to mark electrical components such as
    contactors and relays, printed circuit boards and keyboards.
    With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the
    cost of laser marking has decreased. In the photovoltaic (solar
    panel) industry, pulsed lasers increasingly are used to remove
    materials and to scribe (cut) solar cells. The high beam
    quality, increased peak output powers, flexible fiber delivery
    and competitive price of fiber lasers have accelerated the
    adoption of fiber lasers in these low-power applications.

Historically, the printing industry has depended upon
    silver-halide films and chemicals to engrave printing plates.
    This chemical engraving process requires several time-consuming
    steps. In recent years, we have worked closely with OEMs in the
    printing industry to employ fiber lasers for alternative

“computer-to-plate,”

or CTP, processes. As a result, our ytterbium fiber lasers are
    now widely used for CTP printing, an environmentally friendly
    process that saves production time by writing directly to plates
    and greatly reduces chemical waste.

Welding Applications.

Laser welding offers
    several important advantages over conventional welding
    technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate, provides high
    process speed and results in narrow-seamed,



high quality welds that generally require little or no
    post-processing machining. Parts can be accurately machined
    before welding because laser welding does not overly heat or
    otherwise damage or distort the material being processed. The
    high beam quality of our fiber lasers coupled with high CW power
    offers deep penetration welding as well as shallow conduction
    mode welding. High modulation frequencies offer very high
    throughput in pulsed applications. In addition, fiber lasers can
    be focused to a small spot with extremely long focal lengths,
    enabling remote welding “on the fly,” a flexible
    method of three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is
    positioned by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding
    stations equipped with fiber lasers are used for welding door
    panels and the multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the
    entire auto body frame. Typically, mid to high-power ytterbium
    fiber lasers and long pulse quasi-continuous wave ytterbium
    fiber lasers are used in welding applications.

Cutting Applications.

Laser-based cutting
    technology has several advantages compared to alternative
    technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible, and highly
    precise and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular
    or three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be
    programmed to process many different kinds of materials such as
    steel, aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at
    various thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact
    process that is easy to integrate into an automated production
    line and is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell
    low, mid and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser
    cutting. The operating wavelength, high beam quality, wide
    operating power range, power stability and small spot size are
    some of the qualities offered by fiber lasers for most cutting
    applications.

Advanced
    Applications

Our fiber lasers and amplifiers are utilized by commercial firms
    and by academic and government institutions worldwide for
    manufacturing of commercial systems and for research in advanced
    technologies and products. These markets may use specialty
    products developed by us or commercial versions of our products.

Directed Energy.

Our high-power fiber lasers
    and amplifiers have been used in variety of demonstrations.

Obstacle Warning and Mapping.

Our products are
    used aboard aircraft for obstacle warning and

3-dimensional

mapping of earth surfaces.

Special Projects.

Due to the high power,
    compactness, performance, portability, ruggedness and electrical
    efficiency of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, we sell our
    commercial products for government research and projects. These
    include materials testing, ordnance destruction, coherent beam
    combining, advanced communications and research.

Research and Development.

Our products are
    used in a variety of applications for research and development
    by scientists and industrial researchers. In addition, our
    lasers and amplifiers are used to design, test and characterize
    components and systems in a variety of markets and applications.

Optical Pumping and Harmonic
    Generation.

Several types of our lasers are used
    to optically pump other solid-state lasers and for harmonic
    generation and parametric converters to support research in
    sensing, medical and other scientific research in the infrared
    and visible wavelength domains. Our lasers are used as a power
    source for these other lasers. Green visible lasers are used to
    pump titanium sapphire lasers. Visible lasers can be used in
    optical displays, planetariums and light shows.

Optical Communication.

We provide high-power
    EDFAs and ytterbium fiber amplifiers for deployment in both

point-to-point

and

point-to-multipoint

free space optical networks. These networks permit
    communications between two or more points on land or in the sky
    without the use of fiber optic lines or radio or microwaves.

Remote Sensing.

Our products are used in light
    detection and ranging, also called LIDAR, a laser technique for
    remote sensing. Optical fiber can be used as a sensor for
    measuring changes in temperature, pressure and gas concentration
    in oil wells, atmospheric and pollution measurements and seismic
    exploration.



Communications

We design and manufacture a DWDM transport system with varying
    output power and wavelengths and a full range of fiber
    amplifiers and Raman pump lasers that enhance data transmission
    in broadband access and DWDM optical networks. We are leveraging
    our high-power diode and fiber technology through the
    qualification and sale of high-value integrated solutions for
    network suppliers.

DWDM.

DWDM is a technology that expands the
    capacity of optical networks, allowing service providers to
    extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating
    and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a
    broad range of high-power products for DWDM applications
    including EDFAs and Raman lasers. We provide a DWDM transport
    system that offers service providers and private network
    operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution scalable
    from 8 to 40 channels that operates at 10 gibabits per second
    per channel.

Broadband Access.

The delivery to subscribers
    of television programming and Internet-based information and
    communication services is converging, driven by advances in IP
    technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive
    environment. Fiber optic lines offer connection speeds of up to
    50 megabits per second, or 50 times faster than digital
    subscriber lines (DSL) or cable links. We offer a series of
    specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable TV nodes and transmitters
    that support different types of passive optical network
    architectures, enabling high speed data, voice, video on demand
    and high definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to
    32 ports, which allows service providers to support a high
    number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power
    consumption and network cost. End users for our products include
    communications network operators for video wavelength division
    multiplexing overlay, as well as cable and multiple service
    operators for video signal and hybrid fiber coaxial cable.

Medical

We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that
    incorporate our products into their medical laser systems.
    Continuous wave and pulsed lasers from 1 to 150 watts and diode
    laser systems can be used in medical and biomedical
    applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include
    skin rejuvenation, skin resurfacing and stretch mark removal.
    Purchasers use our diode lasers in dental, skin tightening and
    fat removal procedures. Surgical applications include prostate
    surgery. Fiber lasers have the ability to fine-tune optical
    penetration depth and absorption characteristics and can be used
    for ear, nose and throat, urology, gynecology and other surgical
    procedures.

Technology

Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform
    that we have developed and refined since our formation. The
    following technologies are key elements in our products.

Specialty
    Optical Fibers

We have extensive expertise in the disciplines and techniques
    that form the basis for the multi-clad active and passive
    optical fibers used in our products. Active optical fibers form
    the laser cavity or gain medium in which lasing or amplification
    of light occurs in our products. Passive optical fibers deliver
    the optical energy created in our products. Our active fibers
    consist of an inner core that is infused with the appropriate
    rare earth ion, such as ytterbium, erbium or thulium, and outer
    cores of un-doped glass having different indices of refraction.
    We believe that our large portfolio of specialty active and
    passive optical fibers has a number of advantages as compared to
    other commercially available optical fibers. These advantages
    include higher concentrations of rare earth ions, fibers that
    will not degrade at the high power levels over the useful life
    of the product, high lasing efficiency, ability to achieve
    single-mode outputs at high powers, ability to withstand high
    optical energies and temperatures and scalable side-pumping
    capability.



Semiconductor
    Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies

Another key element of our technology platform is that we use
    multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather
    than diode bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that
    multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and
    reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode
    bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability.
    Single-emitter diodes have substantially reduced cooling
    requirements and typically have estimated lifetimes of more than
    200,000 hours at high operating currents, compared to
    typical lifetimes of 10,000 to 20,000 hours for diode bars.

We developed advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow
    alumina indium gallium arsenide wafers for our diodes. This
    method yields high-quality optoelectronic material for
    low-defect density and high uniformity of optoelectronic
    parameters. In addition, we have developed numerous proprietary
    wafer processes and testing and qualification procedures in
    order to create a high energy output in a reliable and
    high-power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically sealed
    pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an optical
    fiber output. Characteristics such as the ability of the package
    to dissipate heat produced by the diode and withstand vibration,
    shock, high temperature, humidity and other environmental
    conditions are critical to the reliability and efficiency of the
    products.

Specialty
    Components and Combining Techniques

We developed a wide range of advanced optical components that
    are capable of handling high optical power levels and contribute
    to the superior performance, efficiency, reliability and
    uniqueness of our products. In addition to fibers and diodes,
    our optical component portfolio includes fiber gratings,
    isolators and combiners. We also developed special methods and
    expertise in splicing fibers together with low optical energy
    loss and on-line loss testing. We believe that our internal
    development and manufacturing of key optical components allows
    us to lower our manufacturing costs and improve product
    performance.

Side
    Pumping of Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a large
    number of multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes with
    our active optical fibers that are used in all of our products.
    A key element of this technology is that we pump our fiber
    lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core. We
    splice our specialty active optical fibers with other optical
    components and package them in a sealed box, which we call a
    fiber block. The fiber blocks are compact and eliminate the risk
    of contamination or misalignment due to mechanical vibrations
    and shocks as well as temperature or humidity variations. Our
    design is scalable and modular, permitting us to make products
    with high output power by coupling a large number of diodes with
    fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and serially.

High-Stress
    Testing

We employ high-stress techniques in testing components and final
    products that help increase reliability and accelerate product
    development. For example, we test all of our diodes with high
    current and temperatures to accelerate aging. We also have built
    a large database of diode test results that allows us to predict
    the estimated lifetime of our diodes. This testing allows us to
    eliminate defective diodes prior to further assembly and thus
    increase reliability.

Customers

We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and
    end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the
    in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into
    their own systems. We have hundreds of customers worldwide. Our
    end markets include materials processing (comprised of general
    manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, consumer
    products and medical device manufacturing, photovoltaic
    semiconductor and electronics customers), advanced applications
    (comprised of commercial companies, universities, research
    entities and government entities), communications (comprised of
    system integrators, utilities and municipalities) and medical
    (medical laser systems manufacturers and researchers).



We believe that our customer and end market diversification
    minimizes dependence on any single industry or group of
    customers.

Backlog

At December 31, 2009, our backlog of orders (generally
    scheduled for shipment within one year) was approximately
    $68.1 million compared to $69.3 million at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, our backlog
    included $47.8 million of orders with firm shipment dates
    and $20.3 million of frame agreements that we expect to
    ship within one year, compared to $47.0 million of orders
    with firm shipment dates and $22.3 million of frame
    agreements at December 31, 2008. Frame agreements generally
    are agreements without committed shipment dates. Orders used to
    compute backlog are generally cancelable without substantial
    penalties. Historically, the rate of cancellation experienced by
    us has not been significant. We manage the risk of cancellation
    by establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that
    generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials
    and development costs incurred prior to the order being
    cancelled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many
    factors including, but not limited to, the customer’s
    requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding
    orders with the customer and our ability to quickly convert the
    cancelled order to another sale.

We anticipate shipping a substantial majority of the present
    backlog during fiscal year 2010. However, our backlog at any
    given date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any
    future period.

Sales,
    Marketing and Support

We market our products internationally primarily through our
    direct sales force and also through agreements with independent
    sales representatives and distributors. We have sales offices in
    the United States, Germany, Russia, Italy, China, Japan, South
    Korea, India, the United Kingdom, Singapore and France. Our
    independent sales representatives and distributors are located
    in the United States, Russia, Japan, Brazil, Mexico and other
    parts of the world. Only one of these arrangements is on an
    exclusive basis. Foreign sales to customers are generally priced
    in local currencies and are therefore subject to currency
    exchange fluctuations.



We maintain a customer support and field service staff in our
    major markets. We work closely with customers, customer groups
    and independent representatives to service equipment, train
    customers to use our products and explore additional
    applications for our technologies. We have materials processing
    application centers in the United States, Germany, Russia,
    China, Italy, Japan and South Korea, which we use to demonstrate
    our products and develop new applications. We may expand our
    support and field service, particularly in locations where
    customer concentration or volume requires local service
    capabilities. We repair products at our facilities or at
    customer sites.

We typically provide one to three-year parts and service
    warranties on our lasers and amplifiers. Most of our sales
    offices provide support to customers in their respective
    geographic areas. Warranty reserves have generally been
    sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement
    costs.

Manufacturing

Vertical integration is one of our core business strategies
    through which we control our proprietary processes and
    technologies as well as the supply of key components and
    assemblies. We believe that our vertically integrated business
    model gives us the following advantages:

•

maintaining a technological lead over competitors;

•

reducing component and final product costs compared to market
    prices available to competitors;

•

ensuring access to critical components, enabling us to better
    meet customer demands;

•

controlling performance, quality and consistency; and

•

enabling rapid development and deployment of new products and
    technologies.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include
    optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor
    wafer growth, diode processing and packaging, specialty optical
    component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly
    for different power units, software and electronics development,
    final assembly, as well as testing, tool manufacturing and
    automated production systems. Over the last three years, we
    added additional production capabilities, including three
    multi-wafer growth reactors, diode test stations, fiber pre-form
    and fiber drawing equipment, low, mid and high-power production
    and testing, in order to increase our capacity as well as reduce
    the risks associated with our production process.

We operate our own semiconductor foundry for the production of
    the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that
    are used as the light source in each device we make. We also
    process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. Because
    pump diodes represent a significant component cost of the final
    laser or amplifier, we have chosen to develop internal
    manufacturing capabilities for diodes. As a result of our high
    volume production levels of pump diodes, proprietary processes
    and use of limited chip designs, we have been able to increase
    yields, lower component costs and assure high quality. We also
    design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test
    instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly
    tools and machines.

We developed these proprietary components, manufacturing tools,
    equipment and techniques over many years in an effort to address
    the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of
    fiber laser technology and to provide products that
    differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that the
    proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment,
    techniques and software utilized in all of our product lines
    provide extensive barriers to potential competitors. Generally,
    we do not sell our proprietary components to third parties,
    except that in 2008, we started selling our diodes to third
    parties. Using our technology platform, we configure standard
    products based upon each customer’s specifications. Through
    our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, we can
    develop, test and produce new products and configurations with
    higher performance and reliability and in less time than by
    working with external vendors. We have developed proprietary
    testing methodologies that allow us to develop higher power
    components and products in short periods of time, enable us to
    introduce products to the market more quickly, capitalize on new
    opportunities and provide superior service to our customers.



Our in-house manufacturing generally includes only those
    operations and components that are critical to the protection of
    our intellectual property, the reduction of our costs or the
    achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase
    from vendors common and specialized mechanical, electrical and
    optical parts and raw materials, such as printed circuit boards,
    wafer substrates and various optical components.

Research
    and Development

We have extensive research and development experience in laser
    materials, fiber and optoelectronic components. We have
    assembled a team of scientists and engineers with specialized
    experience and extensive knowledge in fiber lasers and
    amplifiers, critical components, testing and manufacturing
    process design.

We focus our research and development efforts on designing and
    introducing new and improved standard and customized products
    and the mass production of components that go into our products.
    In addition to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we
    have core competencies in high-power multi-mode semiconductor
    laser diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive
    optical fibers, high-performance optical components, fiber gain
    blocks and fiber modules, as well as splicing and combining
    techniques and high-stress test methods. Our research and
    development efforts are aided by our vertical integration and
    our proprietary high-stress testing techniques that result in
    accelerated development cycles. The strategy of developing our
    proprietary components has allowed us to leverage our optical
    experience and large volume requirements to lower the cost of
    our products. We concentrate our research and development
    efforts on advancements in performance as well as capacity to
    hold and produce higher optical power levels.

Our research and development efforts are also directed at
    expanding our product line by increasing power levels, improving
    beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing the size of
    our products and lowering the cost per watt. We also are engaged
    in research projects to expand the spectral range of products
    that we offer. Our team of experienced scientists and engineers
    work closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce
    custom products that address specific applications and
    performance requirements.

We incurred research and development costs of approximately
    $18.5 million in 2009, $15.8 million in 2008 and
    $9.5 million in 2007. We plan to continue our commitment to
    research and development and to introduce new products, systems
    and complementary products that would allow us to maintain our
    competitive position. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of Results of
    Operations.”

Intellectual
    Property

We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through
    U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade
    secrets, and to seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and
    trademark protection of our products and processes where
    appropriate. Historically, we relied primarily on trade secrets,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    relating to our product development and manufacturing
    activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary
    information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into
    agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and
    the assignment to us of rights to inventions that they make
    while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure
    agreements with our consultants and suppliers to protect
    confidential information delivered to them. We believe that our
    vertical integration, including our long experience in making a
    wide range of specialty and high-power capacity components, as
    well as our technology platform make it difficult for others to
    reverse engineer our products.

We have increased our efforts to expand our patent portfolio. In
    February 2008, we purchased a portfolio of photonics patents
    from British Telecommunications plc that included approximately
    100 U.S. patents and 340 foreign counterparts in the fields
    of optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, semiconductor devices,
    integrated optics, fiber gratings, high-speed systems and
    optical networking. In addition, as of March 1, 2010, we
    had over 55 patent applications filed and under review by
    the relevant patent authorities. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, we were
    issued seven patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
    Office relating to optical fibers, bulk optics and
    telecommunications systems. Intellectual property rights,
    including those that we own and those of others, involve
    significant risks. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Our
    inability to Protect Our Intellectual Property and



Proprietary Technologies Could Result in the Unauthorized Use of
    Our Technologies by Third Parties, Hurt Our Competitive Position
    and Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”

Competition

Our markets are competitive and characterized by rapidly
    changing technology and continuously evolving customer
    requirements. We believe that the primary competitive factors in
    our markets are:

•

product performance and reliability;

•

quality and service support;

•

price and value to the customer;

•

ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis;

•

ability to achieve qualification for and integration into OEM
    systems;

•

ability to meet customer specifications; and

•

ability to respond quickly to market demand and technological
    developments.

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these criteria.
    In the materials processing market, the competition is
    fragmented and includes a large number of competitors. We
    compete with makers of high-power
    CO


and solid-state lasers, including Fanuc, Lasag Ltd., Rofin-Sinar
    Technologies, Inc. and Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, and makers of mid
    and low-power
    CO


and solid-state lasers such as Coherent, Inc., GSI Group Inc.,
    Newport Corporation and Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. We also
    compete with fiber laser makers including Rofin-Sinar
    Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc.,
    Coherent Inc., Newport Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co.,
    Ltd., Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi
    Unitek Corporation, MPB Communications Inc., and JDS Uniphase
    Corporation. We believe that we compete favorably with other
    makers of fiber lasers on price, service, installed base and
    performance with respect to low and mid-power fiber lasers.
    Recently competition from other fiber laser makers increased in
    this power range. We currently have limited competition in
    high-power fiber lasers, but recently some competitors
    introduced high-power fiber lasers that compete with our
    products. We also compete in the materials processing, advanced
    and medical applications markets with end users that produce
    their own solid-state and gas lasers as well as with
    manufacturers of non-laser methods and tools, such as resistance
    welding and cutting dies in the materials processing market and
    scalpels in the medical market.

In the communications market, our principal competitors are
    manufacturers of mid-power fiber amplifiers and DWDM systems,
    such as Bookham Inc., the Scientific-Atlanta division of Cisco
    Systems, Inc. (Scientific-Atlanta), Emcore Corporation, JDS
    Uniphase Corporation, Huawei Corporation and MPB Communications
    Inc. We believe that we compete favorably with other high-power
    fiber amplifier producers with respect to price, product
    performance and output power. The fiber amplifier market is more
    established than the fiber laser market and technological change
    has not occurred as rapidly as it has in the case of fiber
    lasers.

Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    1,430 full-time employees, including 140 in research and
    development, 1,090 in manufacturing operations, 70 in sales,
    service and marketing, and 130 in general and administrative
    functions. Of our total full-time employees at our principal
    facilities, approximately 380 were in the United States, 520
    were in Germany, 380 were in Russia and 50 were in China. We
    have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees
    is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that
    our current relations with our employees are good.



Government
    Regulation

Regulatory
    Compliance

The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the
    United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products
    under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for
    Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration. The same classification system is applied
    in the European markets. Safety rules are formulated with
    “Deutsche Industrie Norm” (i.e., German Industrial
    Standards) or ISO standards, which are internationally
    harmonized.

CDRH regulations generally require a self-certification
    procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing
    to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser
    device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply
    with product labeling standards, product safety and design
    features and informational requirements. Our products
    applications can result in injury to human tissue if directed at
    an individual or otherwise misused. The CDRH is empowered to
    seek fines and other remedies for violations of their
    requirements. We believe that our products are in material
    compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the
    manufacture of laser devices.

Environmental
    Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and
    international laws governing the environment, including those
    relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product
    composition and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous
    and toxic materials. We believe that our operations are in
    material compliance with applicable environmental protection
    laws and regulations.

Although we believe that our safety procedures for using,
    handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with
    the standards required by federal and state laws and
    regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of
    accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the
    event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be
    liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of
    our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our
    business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The factors described below are the principal risks that
    could materially adversely affect our operating results and
    financial condition. Other factors may exist that we do not
    consider significant based on information that is currently
    available. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we
    cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they
    may affect us.

Downturns
    in the markets we serve, particularly materials processing,
    could have a material adverse effect on our sales and
    profitability.

Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by
    our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials
    processing market, which includes automotive, marking,
    electronics and photovoltaic applications. Approximately 76% of
    our revenues in 2009 were from customers in the materials
    processing market. Although applications in this market are
    broad, sales for these applications are cyclical and have
    historically experienced sudden and severe downturns and periods
    of oversupply, resulting in significantly reduced demand for
    capital equipment, including the products that we manufacture
    and market. In 2009, our sales decreased by approximately 25% in
    the materials processing market as a result of the global
    economic recession during 2009. For the foreseeable future, our
    operations will continue to depend upon capital



expenditures by customers in this market, which, in turn, depend
    upon the demand for their products or services. Decreased demand
    for products and services from customers for these applications
    during an economic downturn may lead to decreased demand for our
    products, which would reduce our sales and margins. We may not
    be able to respond by decreasing our expenses quickly enough,
    due in part, to our fixed overhead structure related to our
    vertically-integrated operations and our commitments to
    continuing investment in research and development.

Uncertainty
    and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of
    markets in which we participate negatively affect our
    business.

Current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate
    the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole.
    It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in
    various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the
    materials processing, telecommunications, advanced and medical
    markets and applications in which we participate. Because all
    components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon
    estimates of growth or contraction in the markets and
    applications we serve and demand for our products, the
    prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future
    income and expenditures very difficult to make. Adverse changes
    have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of
    declining or flat global or regional economic conditions,
    fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering
    confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment,
    declines in stock markets, contraction of credit availability,
    declines in real estate values, or other factors affecting
    economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively
    affect the sales of our lasers and amplifiers, increase exposure
    to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the
    availability of financing, increase the risk of loss on
    investments, or increase costs associated with manufacturing and
    distributing products. A prolonged economic downturn could have
    a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Our
    sales depend upon our ability to penetrate new applications for
    fiber lasers and increase our market share in existing
    applications.

Our level of sales will depend on our ability to generate sales
    of fiber lasers in applications where conventional lasers, such
    as
    CO


and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers, have been used or in
    new and developing markets and applications for lasers where
    they have not been used previously. To date, a significant
    portion of our revenue growth has been derived from sales of
    fiber lasers primarily for applications where
    CO


and YAG lasers historically have been used. In order to maintain
    or increase market demand for our fiber laser products, we will
    need to devote substantial resources to:

•

demonstrate the effectiveness of fiber lasers in new
    applications;

•

increase our direct and indirect sales efforts;

•

effectively service and support our installed product base.

•

extend our product line to address new applications for our
    products;

•

continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and enhance our
    competitive position; and

If we are unable to implement our strategy to develop new
    applications for our products, our revenues, operating results
    and financial condition could be adversely affected. We cannot
    assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our
    business strategy. In addition, our newly developed or enhanced
    products may not achieve market acceptance or may be rendered
    obsolete or less competitive by the introduction of new products
    by other companies.

If
    fiber lasers do not achieve broader market acceptance or if
    market penetration occurs more slowly than we expect, sales and
    profitability may be negatively impacted.

Fiber lasers are relatively new when compared to conventional
    lasers and our future success depends on the development and
    broader acceptance of fiber lasers. Potential customers may be
    reluctant to adopt fiber



lasers as an alternative to conventional lasers, such as
    CO


and
    YAG, and non-laser methods, such as mechanical tools. Such
    potential customers may have substantial investments and
    know-how related to their existing laser and non-laser
    technologies, and may perceive risks relating to the
    reliability, quality, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fiber
    lasers when compared to other laser or non-laser technologies
    available in the market. Many of our target markets, such as the
    automotive, machine tool and other manufacturing, communications
    and medical industries, have historically adopted new
    technologies slowly. These markets often require long test and
    qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes
    before adopting new technologies. As a result, we may expend
    significant resources and time to qualify our products for a new
    customer application, and we cannot assure that our products
    will be qualified or approved for such markets. If acceptance of
    fiber laser technology and of our fiber lasers in particular
    does not continue to grow within the markets that we serve, then
    the opportunities to maintain or increase our revenues and
    profitability may be severely limited.

Our
    vertically integrated business results in high levels of fixed
    costs and inventory levels that may adversely impact our gross
    profits and our operating results in the event that demand for
    our products declines or we maintain excess inventory
    levels.

We have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated
    business model, including the fact that approximately 76% of our
    1,430 employees as of December 31, 2009 were employed
    in our manufacturing operations. We may not adjust these fixed
    costs quickly enough to adapt to rapidly changing market
    conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a
    percentage of net sales, is impacted by our sales volume, the
    corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead
    expenses and manufacturing yields. In addition, because we are a
    vertically integrated manufacturer and design and manufacture
    our key specialty components, insufficient demand for our
    products may subject us to the risks of high inventory carrying
    costs and increased inventory obsolescence. If our capacity and
    production levels are not properly sized in relation to expected
    demand, we may need to record write-downs for excess or obsolete
    inventory. Because we are vertically integrated, the rate at
    which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared
    to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change
    significantly in the future and believe that we will have to
    maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our
    cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a
    significant amount of working capital invested in inventory.
    Changes in our level of inventory lead to an increase in cash
    generated from our operations when inventory is sold or a
    decrease in cash generated from our operations at times when the
    amount of inventory increases.

Our
    manufacturing capacity and operations may not be appropriate for
    future levels of demand and may adversely affect our gross
    margins.

In response to an increase in demand for our fiber lasers, we
    started adding substantial manufacturing capacity at our
    facilities in the United States, Germany and Russia beginning in
    2005. We continue to expand our capacity further in Russia. A
    significant portion of our manufacturing facilities and
    production equipment, such as our semiconductor production and
    processing equipment, diode packaging equipment and diode
    burn-in stations, are special-purpose in nature and cannot be
    adapted easily to make other products. If the demand for fiber
    lasers or amplifiers does not increase or decreases from current
    levels, we may have significant excess manufacturing capacity
    and under-absorption of our fixed costs, which could in turn
    adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.

To maintain our competitive position as the leading developer
    and manufacturer of fiber lasers and to meet anticipated demand
    for our products, we invested significantly in the expansion of
    our manufacturing and operations throughout the world and may do
    so in the future. We incurred in the past and will incur
    significant costs associated with the acquisition, build-out and
    preparation of our facilities. We had capital expenditures of
    $10.5 million and $37.1 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and we expect to incur approximately
    $25 million in capital expenditures, including
    acquisitions, in 2010. In connection with these projects, we may
    incur cost overruns, construction delays, labor difficulties or
    regulatory issues which could cause our capital expenditures to
    be higher than what we currently anticipate, possibly by a
    material amount, which would in turn adversely impact our
    operating results. Moreover, we may experience higher costs due
    to yield loss,



production inefficiencies and equipment problems until any
    operational issues associated with the opening of new
    manufacturing facilities are resolved.

The
    laser and amplifier industries are experiencing declining
    average selling prices, which could cause our gross margins to
    decline and harm our operating results.

Products in the laser and amplifier industries generally, and
    our products specifically, are experiencing and may in the
    future continue to experience a decline in average selling
    prices (ASPs) as a result of new product and technology
    introductions, increased competition and price pressures from
    significant customers. If the ASPs of our products decline
    further and we are unable to increase our unit volumes,
    introduce new or enhanced products with higher margins or reduce
    manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the
    prices of our existing products, our operating results may be
    adversely affected. In addition, because of our significant
    fixed costs, we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs
    quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls. Because of these
    factors, we have experienced and we may experience in the future
    material adverse fluctuations in our operating results on a
    quarterly or annual basis if the ASPs of our products continue
    to decline.

Because
    we lack long-term purchase commitments from our customers, our
    sales can be difficult to predict, which could lead to excess or
    obsolete inventory and adversely affect our operating
    results.

We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our
    customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or
    amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase
    orders and shipment schedules and, in some cases, orders may be
    cancelled or delayed without significant penalty. As a result,
    it is difficult to forecast our revenues and to determine the
    appropriate levels of inventory required to meet future demand.
    In addition, due to the absence of long-term volume purchase
    agreements, we forecast our revenues and plan our production and
    inventory levels based upon the demand forecasts of our OEM
    customers, end users, and distributors, which are highly
    unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. This could lead
    to increased inventory levels and increased carrying costs and
    risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to unanticipated
    reductions in purchases by our customers. In this regard, we
    recorded provisions for inventory totaling $5.3 million,
    $3.8 million and $2.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. These provisions were recorded as a result of
    changes in market prices of certain components, the value of
    those inventories that was realizable through finished product
    sales and uncertainties related to the recoverability of the
    value of inventories due to technological changes and excess
    quantities. If our OEM customers, end users or distributors fail
    to accurately forecast the demand for our products, fail to
    accurately forecast the timing of such demand, or are unable to
    consistently negotiate acceptable purchase order terms with
    customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

We may
    experience lower than expected manufacturing yields, which would
    adversely affect our gross margins.

The manufacture of semiconductor diodes and the packaging of
    them is a highly complex process. Manufacturers often encounter
    difficulties in achieving acceptable product yields from diode
    and packaging operations. We have from time to time experienced
    lower than anticipated manufacturing yields for our diodes and
    packaged diodes. This occurs during the production of new
    designs and the installation and

start-up

of
    new process technologies. If we do not achieve planned yields,
    our product costs could increase resulting in lower gross
    margins, and key component availability would decrease.

We are
    subject to litigation alleging that we are infringing
    third-party intellectual property rights. Intellectual property
    claims could result in costly litigation and harm our
    business.

In recent years, there has been significant litigation involving
    intellectual property rights in many technology-based
    industries, including our own. We face risks and uncertainties
    in connection with such litigation, including the risk that
    patents issued to others may harm our ability to do business;
    that there could be existing patents of which we are unaware
    that could be pertinent to our business; and that it is not
    possible for us to know whether there are patent applications
    pending that our products might infringe upon, since



patent applications often are not disclosed until a patent is
    issued or published. Moreover, the frequency with which new
    patents are granted and the diversity of jurisdictions in which
    they are granted make it impractical and expensive for us to
    monitor all patents that may be relevant to our business.

From time to time, we have been notified of allegations and
    claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual
    property rights owned by third parties. In 2007, we settled two
    patent infringement lawsuits filed against us. We are presently
    defending two patent infringement lawsuits.

In November 2006, IMRA America, Inc. filed an action against us
    alleging that certain products we produce, including but not
    limited to our continuous wave and pulsed fiber lasers and fiber
    amplifiers, which account for a significant portion of our
    revenues, infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA
    America. IMRA America alleges willful infringement and seeks
    damages of at least $10 million, treble damages and
    injunctive relief. IMRA America also alleges inducement of
    infringement and contributory infringement. We filed an answer
    in which we denied infringement and raised additional defenses
    that the patent is invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we
    filed declaratory judgment counterclaims based on these three
    defenses. This lawsuit concerns products made, used, sold or
    offered for sale in or imported into the United States and
    therefore the lawsuit affects products that account for a
    substantial portion of our revenues. This lawsuit does not
    affect revenues that are derived from products that are not
    made, used, sold or offered for sale in or imported into the
    United States. IMRA America has informed us that it has patents
    and applications in foreign jurisdictions directed to similar
    subject matter as the patent subject to this lawsuit, but has
    not asserted them against us. In June 2008, the U.S. Patent
    and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) ordered re-examination
    of the patent claims asserted by IMRA America against the
    Company based on several prior art references that we submitted
    in an ex parte re-examination request. In July 2009, the USPTO
    confirmed the patentability of all of the claims in the IMRA
    America patent over the prior art cited in the re-examination,
    as well as of new claims added during the re-examination. In
    August 2009, IPG submitted an additional re-examination request,
    which was denied by the USPTO. The USPTO issued a re-examination
    certificate in October 2009. As a result, the U.S. District
    Court for the Eastern District of Michigan lifted the stay on
    the litigation. A trial is scheduled for August 2010 and
    discovery has recommenced.

In February 2008, CardioFocus Inc. filed an action against us
    and other co-defendants alleging that our erbium and thulium
    fiber lasers infringe one patent allegedly owned by CardioFocus
    and seeking unspecified damages, treble damages and
    attorneys’ fees for alleged willful infringement.
    CardioFocus also alleges inducement of infringement. The patent
    claims generally relate to a system for transmitting laser
    energy via an optical fiber to a surgical site. The patent
    expired in April 2007. We filed an answer in which we denied
    infringement and raised additional defenses that the patent is
    invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we filed declaratory
    judgment counterclaims based on these three defenses.
    CardioFocus subsequently alleged that the Company infringes
    claims of two additional patents. We and several of our
    co-defendants filed re-examination requests, which were granted
    by the USPTO. As a result of three separate office actions in
    the second half of 2009, the USPTO rejected a substantial number
    of claims in the three patents, many of which CardioFocus
    disclaimed, and the USPTO confirmed the patentability of several
    other claims of these patents. The U.S. District Court for
    the District of Massachusetts initially stayed the litigation
    until the earlier of October 2009 or the conclusion of the
    re-examinations, and indicated that it will consider extending
    the stay for up to an additional year for good cause shown. We
    and the other defendants have requested that the Court extend
    the stay until the earlier of October 2010 or the conclusion of
    the re-examinations. The Court has not yet ruled on this
    request, and discovery has not yet resumed.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose
    without a material effect the litigations with IMRA America or
    CardioFocus, claims or other allegations made against us and
    claims that may be asserted in the future. The outcome of any
    litigation, including the pending litigation, is uncertain, as
    is the outcome of any remaining re-examination of the
    CardioFocus patents. Even if we ultimately are successful on the
    merits of any such litigation or re-examination, legal and
    administrative proceedings related to intellectual property are
    typically expensive and time-consuming, generate negative
    publicity and divert financial and managerial resources. Some
    litigants may have greater financial resources than we have and
    may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual
    property litigation more easily than we can.



If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation
    brought against us, including the lawsuits brought by IMRA
    America and CardioFocus, it could affect our ability to sell our
    products and materially harm our business, financial condition
    and results of operations. These developments could adversely
    affect our ability to compete for customers and increase our
    revenues. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek,
    and sometimes obtain, injunctive relief. Intellectual property
    litigation commenced against us, including the lawsuits brought
    by IMRA America and CardioFocus that we are presently defending,
    could force us to take actions that could be harmful to our
    business, competitive position, results of operations and
    financial condition, including the following:

•

stop selling our products or using the technology that contains
    the allegedly infringing intellectual property;

•

pay actual monetary damages, royalties, lost profits or
    increased damages and the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees,
    which individually or in the aggregate may be substantial;

•

attempt to obtain a license to use the relevant intellectual
    property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at
    all; and

•

attempt to redesign the products that allegedly infringed upon
    intellectual property of others, which may be costly or
    impractical.

In addition, intellectual property lawsuits can be brought by
    third parties against OEMs and end users that incorporate our
    products into their systems or processes. In some cases, we
    indemnify OEMs against third-party infringement claims relating
    to our products and we often make representations affirming,
    among other things, that our products do not infringe on the
    intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may
    incur liabilities in connection with lawsuits against our
    customers. Any such lawsuits, whether or not they have merit,
    could be time-consuming to defend, damage our reputation or
    result in substantial and unanticipated costs.

Our
    inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
    technologies could result in the unauthorized use of our
    technologies by third parties, hurt our competitive position and
    adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on patents, trade secret laws, contractual agreements,
    technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information
    to protect our products, product development and manufacturing
    activities from unauthorized copying by third parties. Although
    we acquired a patent portfolio in 2008 and started a program in
    2007 to increase the number of patent applications we file, our
    patents do not cover all of our technologies, products and
    product components and may not prevent third parties from
    unauthorized copying of our technologies, products and product
    components. We seek to protect our proprietary technology under
    laws affording protection for trade secrets. We also seek to
    protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part,
    by requiring employees to enter into agreements providing for
    the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment of rights
    to inventions made by them while employed by us. We have
    significant international operations and we are subject to
    foreign laws which differ in many respects from U.S. laws.
    Policing unauthorized use of our trade secret technologies
    throughout the world and proving misappropriation of our
    technologies are particularly difficult, especially due to the
    number of our employees and operations in numerous foreign
    countries. The steps that we take to acquire ownership of our
    employees’ inventions and trade secrets in foreign
    countries may not have been effective under all such local laws,
    which could expose us to potential claims or the inability to
    protect intellectual property developed by our employees.
    Furthermore, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of,
    the trade secret and other intellectual property laws in any
    country in which we operate may adversely affect our ability to
    enforce our trade secret and intellectual property positions.
    Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to
    determine the scope of our confidential information and trade
    secret protection. We also enter into confidentiality agreements
    with our consultants and other suppliers to protect our
    confidential information that we deliver to them. However, there
    can be no assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not
    be breached, that we will be able to effectively enforce them or
    that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.



Given our reliance on trade secret laws, others may
    independently develop similar or alternative technologies or
    duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we
    have made. Therefore, our intellectual property efforts may be
    insufficient to maintain our competitive advantage or to stop
    other parties from commercializing similar products or
    technologies. Many countries outside of the United States afford
    little or no protection to trade secrets and other intellectual
    property rights. Intellectual property litigation can be
    time-consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that we
    will have the resources to fully enforce our rights. If we are
    unable to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our
    intellectual property rights, or the independent development or
    design of similar technologies, our competitive position and
    operating results could suffer.

We
    depend upon internal production and on outside single or
    limited-source suppliers for many of our key components and raw
    materials. Any interruption in the supply of these key
    components and raw materials could adversely affect our results
    of operations.

We rely exclusively on our own production capabilities to
    manufacture certain of our key components, such as semiconductor
    diodes, specialty optical fibers and optical components. We do
    not have redundant production lines for some of our components,
    such as our diodes and some other components, which are made at
    a single manufacturing facility. These may not be readily
    available from other sources at our current costs. If our
    manufacturing activities were obstructed or hampered
    significantly, it could take a considerable length of time, or
    it could increase our costs, for us to resume manufacturing or
    find alternative sources of supply. Many of the tools and
    equipment we use are custom-designed, and it could take a
    significant period of time to repair or replace them. Our three
    major manufacturing facilities are located in Oxford,
    Massachusetts; Burbach, Germany; and Fryazino, Russia. If, as a
    result of a flood, fire, natural disaster, political unrest, act
    of terrorism, war, outbreak of disease or other similar event,
    any of our three major manufacturing facilities or equipment
    should become inoperable, inaccessible, damaged or destroyed,
    our business could be adversely affected to the extent that we
    do not have redundant production capabilities.

Also, we purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture our
    products and other components, such as semiconductor wafer
    substrates, diode packages, modulators, micro-optics, bulk
    optics and high-power beam delivery products, from single or
    limited-source suppliers. In general, we have no long-term
    contractual supply arrangements with these suppliers. Some of
    our suppliers are also our competitors. In 2009, some of our
    suppliers reduced their inventory levels and manufacturing
    capacity as a result of the recession, and we may experience
    longer lead times or delays in fulfillment of our orders.
    Furthermore, other than our current suppliers, there are a
    limited number of entities from whom we could obtain these
    supplies. We do not anticipate that we would be able to purchase
    these components or raw materials that we require in a short
    period of time or at the same cost from other sources in
    commercial quantities or that have our required performance
    specifications. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any
    of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain
    these components and materials from alternate sources at
    acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could
    adversely affect our business. If our suppliers face financial
    or other difficulties, if our suppliers do not maintain
    sufficient inventory on hand or if there are significant changes
    in demand for the components and materials we obtain from them,
    they could limit the availability of these components and
    materials to us, which in turn could adversely affect our
    business.

We
    rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of
    our senior management and scientific staff and if we are unable
    to retain these key employees and attract other highly skilled
    personnel necessary to grow our business successfully, our
    business and results of operations could suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued
    service of our executive officers, particularly our founder and
    chief executive officer, Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev,
    age 71, and the managing director of our German subsidiary
    IPG Laser GmbH, Dr. Eugene Shcherbakov, age 62, our
    highly trained team of scientists, many of whom have numerous
    years of experience and specialized expertise in optical fibers,
    semiconductors and optical component technology, and other key
    engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support
    personnel, any of whom may leave, which could harm our business.
    The members of our scientific staff who are expected to make
    significant individual contributions to our business are also
    members of our



executive management team as disclosed under Item 10,
    “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate
    Governance” below. Furthermore, our business requires
    scientists and engineers with experience in several disciplines,
    including physics, optics, materials sciences, chemistry and
    electronics. We will need to continue to recruit and retain
    highly skilled scientists and engineers for certain functions.
    Our future success also depends on our ability to identify,
    attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled
    research and development, managerial, operations, sales,
    marketing and customer service personnel. If we fail to attract,
    integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to
    extend and maintain our scientific expertise and grow our
    business could suffer significantly.

Failure
    to effectively build and expand our direct field service and
    support organization could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

We believe that it will become increasingly important for us to
    provide rapid, responsive service directly to our customers
    throughout the world and to build and expand our own personnel
    resources to provide these services. Any actual or perceived
    lack of direct field service in the locations where we sell or
    try to sell our products may negatively impact our sales efforts
    and, consequently, our revenues. Accordingly, we have an ongoing
    effort to develop our direct support systems worldwide. This
    requires us to recruit and train additional qualified field
    service and support personnel as well as maintain effective and
    highly trained organizations that can provide service to our
    customers in various countries. We may not be able to attract
    and train additional qualified personnel to expand our direct
    support operations successfully. We may not be able to find and
    engage additional qualified third-party resources to supplement
    and enhance our direct support operations. Further, we may incur
    significant costs in providing these direct field and support
    services. Failure to implement our direct support operation
    effectively could adversely affect our relationships with our
    customers, and our operating results may suffer.

A few
    customers account for a significant portion of our sales, and if
    we lose any of these customers or they significantly curtail
    their purchases of our products, our results of operations could
    be adversely affected.

We rely on a few customers for a significant portion of our
    sales. In the aggregate, our top five customers accounted for
    12%, 17% and 20% of our consolidated net sales in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Our largest customer accounted for 3%, 7%
    and 7% of sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
    generally do not enter into agreements with our customers
    obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or amplifiers. Our
    business is characterized by short-term purchase orders and
    shipment schedules. If any of our principal customers
    discontinues its relationship with us, replaces us as a vendor
    for certain products or suffers downturns in its business, our
    business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We
    have experienced, and expect to experience in the future,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These
    fluctuations may increase the volatility of our stock
    price.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
    fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We believe that
    fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of
    our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. Factors
    which may have an influence on our operating results in a
    particular quarter include:

•

the increase, decrease, cancellation or rescheduling of
    significant customer orders;

•

the timing of revenue recognition based on the installation or
    acceptance of certain products shipped to our customers;

•

seasonality attributable to different purchasing patterns and
    levels of activity throughout the year in the areas where we
    operate;

•

the timing of customer qualification of our products and
    commencement of volume sales of systems that include our
    products;

•

Our ability to obtain export licenses for our products on a
    timely basis or at all;



•

the rate at which our present and future customers and end users
    adopt our technologies;

•

the gain or loss of a key customer;

•

product or customer mix;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

the relative proportions of our U.S. and international
    sales;

•

our ability to design, manufacture and introduce new products on
    a cost-effective and timely basis;

•

our ability to manage our inventory levels and any inventory
    write-downs;

•

the incurrence of expenses to develop and improve application
    and support capabilities, the benefits of which may not be
    realized until future periods, if at all;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

foreign currency fluctuations; and

•

our ability to control expenses.

These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict our
    operating results. In addition, our ability to accurately
    predict our operating results is complicated by the fact that
    many of our products have long sales cycles, some lasting as
    long as twelve months. Once a sale is made, our delivery
    schedule typically ranges from four weeks to four months, and
    therefore our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the
    same quarter that they are received and will not enhance our
    ability to predict our results for future quarters. In addition,
    long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses
    without offsetting revenues since customers typically expend
    significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our
    products before making a decision to purchase them. Moreover,
    customers may cancel or reschedule shipments, and production
    difficulties could delay shipments. Accordingly, our results of
    operations are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter
    to quarter, and we may not be able to accurately predict when
    these fluctuations will occur.

Foreign
    currency transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales,
    cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange
    losses.

We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of
    most countries in which we operate. In 2009, our net sales
    outside the United States represented a significant portion of
    our total sales. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one
    of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a
    sales transaction using a different currency from the currency
    in which it receives revenues. Changes in exchange rates can
    also affect our results of operations by changing the
    U.S. dollar value of sales and expenses denominated in
    foreign currencies. We cannot accurately predict the impact of
    future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.
    Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be
    able to effectively manage our currency transaction or
    translation risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates
    may increase the price of our products in local currency to our
    foreign customers, which may have an adverse effect on our
    financial condition, cash flows and profitability.

We
    depend on our OEM customers and system integrators and their
    ability to incorporate our products into their
    systems.

Our sales depend in part on our ability to maintain existing and
    secure new OEM customers. Our revenues also depend in part upon
    the ability of our current and potential OEM customers and
    system integrators to develop and sell systems that incorporate
    our laser and amplifier products. The commercial success of
    these systems depends to a substantial degree on the efforts of
    these OEM customers and system integrators to develop and market
    products that incorporate our technologies. Relationships and
    experience with traditional laser makers, limited marketing
    resources, reluctance to invest in research and development and
    other factors affecting these OEM customers and third-party
    system integrators could have a substantial



impact upon our financial results. If OEM customers or
    integrators are not able to adapt existing tools or develop new
    systems to take advantage of the features and benefits of fiber
    lasers, then the opportunities to increase our revenues and
    profitability may be severely limited or delayed. Furthermore,
    if our OEM customers or third-party system integrators
    experience financial or other difficulties that adversely affect
    their operations, our financial condition or results of
    operations may also be adversely affected.

The
    markets for our products are highly competitive and increased
    competition could increase our costs, reduce our sales or cause
    us to lose market share.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by
    significant price and technological competition. Our fiber laser
    and amplifier products compete with conventional laser
    technologies and amplifier products offered by several
    well-established companies, some of which are larger and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do. Also, we compete with widely used
    non-laser production methods, such as resistance welding. We
    believe that competition will be particularly intense from
    makers of
    CO


and YAG lasers, as these makers of conventional solutions may
    lower prices to maintain current market share and have committed
    significant research and development resources to pursue
    opportunities related to these technologies.

In addition, we face competition from a growing number of fiber
    laser makers, including Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf
    GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc., Coherent Inc., Newport
    Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., Keopsys SA,
    Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi Unitek Corporation,
    MPB Communications Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corporation.
    Competition from other fiber laser makers increased and some
    have introduced high-power fiber lasers that compete with our
    products. We may not be able to successfully differentiate our
    current and proposed products from our competitors’
    products and current or prospective customers may not consider
    our products to be superior to competitors’ products. To
    maintain our competitive position, we believe that we will be
    required to continue a high level of investment in research and
    development, application development and customer service and
    support, and to react to market pricing conditions. Many of the
    laser companies that we compete with are larger and have
    substantially greater financial, managerial and technical
    resources, more extensive distribution and service networks,
    greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed
    customer bases than we do.

We may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these
    investments and we may not be able to make the technological
    advances or price adjustments necessary to maintain our
    competitive position. We also compete against our OEM
    customers’ internal production of competitive laser
    technologies.

Our
    inability to manage risks associated with our international
    customers and operations could adversely affect our
    business.

Our products are currently marketed and sold in numerous
    countries. The United States, Germany, Japan, Russia and China
    are our principal markets. A significant amount of our revenues
    are derived from customers outside of the United States. We
    anticipate that foreign sales will continue to account for a
    significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.
    Our operations and sales in these markets are subject to risks
    inherent in international business activities, including:

•

longer accounts receivable collection periods;

•

fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies;

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s economic
    conditions, such as recession;

•

compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and
    regulations and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory
    requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs,
    quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade
    barriers;

•

certification requirements;

•

environmental regulations;



•

less effective protection of intellectual property rights in
    some countries;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our
    customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts,
    and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in
    the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers,
    manufacturers and subcontractors are located;

•

preference for locally produced products;

•

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international
    operations across different geographic areas and cultures;

•

seasonal reductions in business activities; and

•

fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions.

Political and economic instability and changes in governmental
    regulations could adversely affect both our ability to
    effectively operate our foreign sales offices and the ability of
    our foreign suppliers to supply us with required materials or
    services. Any interruption or delay in the supply of our
    required components, products, materials or services, or our
    inability to obtain these components, materials, products or
    services from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within
    a reasonable amount of time, could impair our ability to meet
    scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause
    customers to cancel orders.

We are also subject to risks of doing business in Russia through
    our subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, which provides components and
    test equipment to us and sells finished fiber devices to
    customers in Russia and neighboring countries. The results of
    operations, business prospects and facilities of NTO IRE-Polus
    are subject to the economic and political environment in Russia.
    In recent years Russia has undergone substantial political,
    economic and social change. As is typical of an emerging market,
    Russia does not possess a well-developed business, legal and
    regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more
    mature free market economy. In addition, the tax, currency and
    customs legislation within Russia is subject to varying
    interpretations and changes, which can occur frequently. The
    future economic direction of Russia remains largely dependent
    upon the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary
    measures undertaken by the government, together with tax, legal,
    regulatory and political developments. Our failure to manage the
    risks associated with NTO IRE-Polus and our other existing and
    potential future international business operations could have a
    material adverse effect upon our results of operations.

Our
    products could contain defects, which may reduce sales of those
    products, harm market acceptance of our fiber laser products or
    result in claims against us.

The manufacture of our fiber lasers and amplifiers involves
    highly complex and precise processes. Despite testing by us and
    our customers, errors have been found, and may be found in the
    future, in our products. These defects may cause us to incur
    significant warranty, support and repair costs, incur additional
    costs related to a recall, divert the attention of our
    engineering personnel from our product development efforts and
    harm our relationships with our customers. These problems could
    result in, among other things, loss of revenues or a delay in
    revenue recognition, loss of market share, harm to our
    reputation or a delay or loss of market acceptance of our fiber
    laser products. Defects, integration issues or other performance
    problems in our fiber laser and amplifier products could also
    result in personal injury or financial or other damages to our
    customers, which in turn could damage market acceptance of our
    products. Our customers could also seek damages from us for
    their losses. A product liability claim brought against us, even
    if unsuccessful, could be time-consuming and costly to defend.



We may
    pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses, products,
    patents or technologies. These may involve risks which could
    disrupt our business and may harm our financial
    condition.

We currently have no binding commitments or agreements to make
    any acquisitions and have limited experience in making
    acquisitions. In the future, we may make acquisitions of and
    investments in new businesses, products, patents, technologies
    and geographic areas, or we may acquire operations, products or
    technologies that expand our current capabilities. Acquisitions
    present a number of potential risks and challenges that could,
    if not met, disrupt our business operations, increase our
    operating costs and reduce the value of the acquired company,
    asset or technology to us. For example, if we identify an
    acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully
    negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms. Even if
    we are successful, we may not be able to integrate the acquired
    businesses, products, patents or technologies into our existing
    business and products. As a result of the rapid pace of
    technological change in our industry, we may misjudge the
    long-term potential of an acquired business, product, patent or
    technology, or the acquisition may not be complementary to our
    existing business. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and
    investments, whether or not consummated, may divert our
    management’s attention and require considerable cash
    outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition,
    to complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities,
    incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization
    expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could
    adversely affect our profitability and result in dilution to our
    existing and future stockholders.

We are
    subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could
    impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our
    business, operating results and financial
    condition.

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various
    federal, state, local and international laws governing the
    environment, including those relating to the storage, use,
    discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, and
    human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We could incur
    costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party
    property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required
    to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we
    were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.
    Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and
    without regard to comparative fault. Compliance with current or
    future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our
    ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire
    additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing
    processes, or incur other significant expenses in order to
    remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. At this
    time, we do not believe the costs to maintain compliance with
    current environmental laws to be material. Although we do not
    currently anticipate that such costs will become material, if
    such costs were to become material in the future, whether due to
    unanticipated changes in environmental laws, unanticipated
    changes in our operations or other unanticipated changes, we may
    be required to dedicate additional staff or financial resources
    in order to maintain compliance. There can be no assurance that
    violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur
    in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits,
    human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.

We are
    subject to export control regulations that could restrict our
    ability to increase our international sales and may adversely
    affect our business.

A significant part of our business involves the export of our
    products to other countries. The U.S. government has in
    place a number of laws and regulations that control the export,
    re-export or transfer of

U.S.-origin

products, software and technology. The governments of other
    countries in which we do business have similar regulations
    regarding products, software and technology originating in those
    countries. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain
    a license before we can export, re-export or transfer certain
    products, software or technology. The requirement to obtain a
    license could put us at a competitive disadvantage by
    restricting our ability to sell products to customers in certain
    countries or by giving rise to delays or expenses related to
    obtaining a license. In applying for a license and responding to
    questions from licensing authorities, we have experienced and,
    in the future, may experience delays in obtaining export
    licenses based on issues solely within the control of the
    applicable government agency. Under the discretion of the
    issuing government agency, an export license may permit the
    export of one unit to a single customer or multiple units to one
    or more customers. Licenses may also include conditions that
    limit the use, resale, transfer, re-export,



modification, disassembly, or transfer of a product, software or
    technology after it is exported without first obtaining
    permission from the relevant government agency. Failure to
    comply with these laws and regulations could result in
    government sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties,
    denial of export privileges, debarment from government contracts
    and a loss of revenues. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain
    required export licenses may require us to defer shipments for
    substantial periods or cancel orders. Any of these circumstances
    could adversely affect our operations and, as a result, our
    financial results could suffer.

Our
    ability to access financial markets to finance a portion of our
    working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs may
    be adversely affected by factors beyond our control and could
    negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet
    certain obligations or implement our operating
    strategy.

We occasionally borrow under our existing credit facilities to
    fund operations, including working capital investments. Our
    major credit lines in the U.S. and Germany expire in July
    2011 and June 2010, respectively. Market disruptions such as
    those currently being experienced in the United States and
    abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt
    markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive,
    and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of
    certain types of financing. Continued uncertainty in the
    financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access
    additional financing or to refinance our existing credit
    facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or
    at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund
    current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and
    development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the
    financial services industry, unprecedented volatility in the
    markets where our outstanding securities trade, and general
    economic downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are
    unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our
    short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to
    finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and
    implement our operating strategy could be adversely affected.

Our
    ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our
    failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from
    growing.

We may in the future be required to raise capital through public
    or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may
    not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure
    to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional
    equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common
    stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive
    covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise
    funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our
    business or respond to competitive pressures.

Dr. Valentin
    P. Gapontsev, our chairman, Chief Executive Officer and
    principal stockholder, controls approximately 41% of our voting
    power and has a significant influence on the outcome of director
    elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval,
    including a change in corporate control.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, our Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer, and IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd. (IPFD), of which
    Dr. Gapontsev is the managing director and majority owner,
    beneficially own approximately 41% of our common stock.
    Dr. Gapontsev has a significant influence on the outcome of
    matters requiring stockholder approval, including:

•

election of our directors;

•

amendment of our certificate of incorporation or
    by-laws; and

•

approval of mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or
    substantially all of our assets.

Dr. Gapontsev may vote his shares of our common stock in
    ways that are adverse to the interests of other holders of our
    common stock. Dr. Gapontsev’s significant ownership
    interest could delay, prevent or cause a change in control of
    our company, any of which could adversely affect the market
    price of our common stock.



Anti-takeover
    provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could
    prevent or delay a change in control of our company, even if a
    change in control would be beneficial to our
    stockholders.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws,
    including certain provisions that will take effect when
    Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev (together with his affiliates and
    associates) ceases to beneficially own an aggregate of 25% or
    more of our outstanding voting securities, may discourage, delay
    or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control, even if
    it would be beneficial to our stockholders. The existence of
    these provisions could also limit the price that investors might
    be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
    These provisions include:

•

authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred
    stock;

•

establishing a classified board;

•

providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

•

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;

•

limiting the persons who may call a special meeting of
    stockholders;

•

establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for
    election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to
    be submitted to a stockholder vote; and

•

supermajority stockholder approval to change these provisions.

Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent
    someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining
    control of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law, which will apply to our
    company following such time as Dr. Gapontsev (together with
    his affiliates and associates) ceases to beneficially own 25% or
    more of the total voting power of our outstanding shares, may
    prohibit business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or
    more of our outstanding voting stock.

Substantial
    sales of our common stock, including shares issued upon the
    exercise of currently outstanding options or pursuant to our
    universal shelf registration statement, could cause our stock
    price to decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the
    perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect the
    market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009,
    we had 46,076,000 shares of common stock outstanding and
    3,028,000 shares subject to outstanding options. We have
    registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under
    our stock option plans and our employee stock ownership plan. In
    addition, all of our unregistered shares of our common stock are
    now eligible for sale under Rule 144, Rule 144(k) or
    Rule 701. As these shares are issued, they may be freely
    sold in the public market, and subject, in the case of any
    awards under our stock-based compensation plans, to applicable
    vesting requirements.

We currently have the ability to offer and sell common stock,
    preferred stock, warrants, debt and convertible securities under
    a currently effective universal shelf registration statement. In
    the future, we may issue additional options, warrants or other
    securities convertible into our common stock. Sales of
    substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other
    securities under our universal shelf registration statement
    could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our
    ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.

If
    securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about
    our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our
    stock could decline.

The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the
    research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish
    about us. If one or more of these analysts who do cover us
    downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline.
    Further, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our
    company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn
    could cause our stock price to decline.

We maintain our corporate headquarters in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    and conduct research and development in Oxford, Massachusetts,
    Burbach, Germany and Fryazino, Russia. We operate four
    manufacturing facilities for lasers, amplifiers and components,
    which are located in the United States, Germany, Russia and
    Italy. We also manufacture certain optical components and
    systems in India and China. We are committed to meeting
    internationally recognized manufacturing standards. Our
    facilities in the United States and Germany are ISO 9001
    certified and we have ISO certification in Russia for specific
    products. We have sales personnel at each of our manufacturing
    facilities, and at offices in Novi, Michigan; Santa Clara,
    California; London, England; Illkirch, France; Yokohama and
    Chibu, Japan; Daejeon, South Korea; Bangalore, India; Beijing,
    China; and Singapore.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our
    current needs and that we will be able to obtain additional
    commercial space as needed.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings and
    other disputes incidental to our business, including those
    described below. For a discussion of the risks associated with
    these legal proceedings and other disputes, see Item 1A.
    “Risk Factors — We are subject to litigation
    alleging that we are infringing third-party intellectual
    property rights. Intellectual property claims could result in
    costly litigation and harm our business.”

In November 2006, IMRA America, Inc. filed an action against us
    alleging that certain products we produce, including but not
    limited to our continuous wave and pulsed fiber lasers and fiber
    amplifiers, which account for a significant portion of our
    revenues, infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA
    America. IMRA America alleges willful infringement and seeks
    damages of at least $10 million, treble damages and
    injunctive relief. IMRA America also alleges inducement of
    infringement and contributory infringement. This lawsuit
    concerns products made, used, sold or offered for sale in or
    imported into the United States and therefore the lawsuit
    affects products that account for a substantial portion of our
    revenues. We filed an answer in which we denied infringement and
    raised additional defenses that the patent is invalid and
    unenforceable. In addition, we filed declaratory judgment
    counterclaims based on these three defenses. This lawsuit does
    not affect revenues that are derived from products that are not
    made, used, sold or offered for sale in or imported into the
    United States. IMRA America has informed us that it has patents
    and applications in foreign jurisdictions directed to similar
    subject matter as the patent subject to this lawsuit, but has
    not asserted them



against us. In June 2008, the USPTO ordered re-examination of
    the patent claims asserted by IMRA America, Inc. against the
    Company based on several prior art references that we submitted
    in an ex parte re-examination request. In July 2009, the United
    States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) confirmed
    the patentability of all of the claims in the IMRA America Inc.,
    patent over the prior art cited in the re-examination, as well
    as of new claims added during the re-examination. The USPTO
    issued a re-examination certificate in October 2009. As result,
    the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
    Michigan lifted the stay on the litigation. A trial is scheduled
    for August 2010 and discovery has recommenced. We intend to
    vigorously contest the claims against us, but we cannot predict
    the outcome of the proceeding.

In February 2008, CardioFocus Inc. filed an action against us
    and other co-defendants alleging that our erbium and thulium
    fiber lasers infringe one patent allegedly owned by CardioFocus
    and seeks unspecified damages, treble damages and
    attorneys’ fees for alleged willful infringement.
    CardioFocus also alleges inducement of infringement. The patent
    claims generally relate to a system for transmitting laser
    energy via an optical fiber to a surgical site. The patent
    expired in April 2007. We filed an answer in which we denied
    infringement and raised additional defenses that the patent is
    invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we filed declaratory
    judgment counterclaims based on these three defenses.
    CardioFocus subsequently alleged that the Company infringes
    claims of two additional patents. The USPTO granted the
    re-examination requests submitted by us and other defendants. As
    a result of three separate office actions occurring in the
    second half of 2009, the USPTO rejected a substantial number of
    claims in the three patents, many of which CardioFocus
    disclaimed, and the USPTO confirmed the patentability of several
    other claims of these patents. The U.S. District Court for
    the District of Massachusetts initially stayed the litigation
    until the earlier of October 2009 or the conclusion of the
    re-examination, and indicated that it would consider extending
    the stay for up to an additional year for good cause shown. We
    and the other defendants have requested that the Court extend
    the stay until the earlier of October 2010 or the conclusion of
    the re-examinations. The Court has not yet ruled on this
    request, and discovery has not yet commenced. We intend to
    vigorously contest the claims against us, but we cannot predict
    the outcome of the proceeding.

Dividends

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital
    stock. We anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to
    support operations and to finance the growth and development of
    our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends
    in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends
    will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking
    into account any business conditions, any contractual and legal
    restrictions on our payment of dividends, and our financial
    condition, operating results, cash needs and growth plans. In
    addition, current agreements with certain of our lenders
    contain, and future loan agreements may contain, restrictive
    covenants that generally prohibit us from paying cash dividends,
    making any distribution on any class of stock or making stock
    repurchases.

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from
    Registered Securities

During the past three years, we have sold and issued the
    following unregistered securities:

1. In December 2008, we issued 50,680 unregistered shares
    of common stock as partial payment of the purchase price for the
    20% noncontrolling interest in IPG Photonics (Italy), S.r.l.
    that we did not previously own. IPG Photonics (Italy), S.r.l. is
    now 100% owned by us. The shares were valued at $13.05 per
    share, the closing price on November 17, 2008.

2. In March 2009, we issued 293,146 unregistered shares of
    common stock as payment of the purchase price for a 31.6%
    noncontrolling interest in NTO IRE-Polus. NTO IRE-Polus is now
    99.9% owned by us. The aggregate sale price for the shares was
    $6,117,973.

3. In May 2009, we issued 75,000 unregistered shares of
    common stock as partial payment of the purchase price for the
    20% noncontrolling interest in IPG Photonics (Japan), Ltd. . IPG
    Photonics (Japan), Ltd. is now 100% owned by us. The aggregate
    sale price for the shares was $848,000.

The sales of securities described in items (1), (2) and
    (3) above were deemed to be exempt from registration
    pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
    Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an
    issuer not involving a public offering. Each of these sales was
    to “accredited investors,” as such term is defined in
    Rule 501 of Regulation D. Each of the recipients of
    securities in the transactions deemed to be exempt from
    registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    received written disclosures that the securities had not been
    registered under the Securities Act and that any resale must be
    made pursuant to a registration or an available exemption from
    such registration. None of the sales of the securities described
    in items (1), (2) and (3) above involved the use of an
    underwriter, and no commissions were paid in connection with the
    sale of any of the securities that we issued. The sales of these
    securities were made without general solicitation or advertising.

Issuer
    Purchases of Equity Securities

During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, there were no
    repurchases made by us or on our behalf, or by any
    “affiliated purchasers,” of shares of our common stock.

    stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. These options
    vested immediately and expired in March 2010.

The change in value of the series B warrants is a non-cash
    charge related to recording the increase or decrease in the fair
    value of the warrants prior to their conversion in December
    2006. The change in fair



value for this derivative instrument was directly related to the
    probability that the warrants would be exercised prior to their
    expiration in April 2008. We used a portion of the net proceeds
    from our IPO to repurchase the series B warrants.

The new guidance on noncontrolling interests requiring
    consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include
    income attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling
    interests was retrospectively applied to all prior periods.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read in
    conjunction with Item 6, “Selected Consolidated
    Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements
    and related notes included in this Annual Report of

Form 10-K.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
    risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ
    materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
    statements as a result of certain factors including, but not
    limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, “Risk
    Factors.”

Overview

We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance
    fiber lasers for diverse applications in numerous markets. Fiber
    lasers are a new generation of lasers that combine the long life
    and high efficiency of semiconductor diodes with the high
    amplification and precise beam qualities of specialty optical
    fibers. Fiber lasers deliver superior performance, reliability
    and usability at a generally lower total cost of ownership
    compared to CO 2 and crystal lasers. Our products are displacing
    conventional lasers in many current applications and also enable
    new applications for lasers.

Our diverse lines of low, mid and high-power lasers and
    amplifiers are used in materials processing, advanced,
    communications and medical applications. We sell our products
    globally to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, system
    integrators and end users. We market our products
    internationally primarily through our direct sales force and
    also through agreements with independent sales representatives
    and distributors. We have sales offices in the United States,
    Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, China, South
    Korea, Singapore, India and Russia.

We are vertically integrated. We design and manufacture most key
    components used in our finished products, including
    semiconductor diodes, optical fiber preforms and cables,
    finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. Our vertically integrated
    operations allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, ensure access
    to critical components, rapidly develop and integrate advanced
    products and protect our proprietary technology.



Since our formation in Russia in 1990, we have been focused on
    developing and manufacturing high-power fiber lasers and
    amplifiers. We established manufacturing and research operations
    in Germany in 1994 and in the United States in 1998. In the
    following years, we developed numerous OEM customer
    relationships for our advanced, active fiber-based products and
    generated a substantial majority of our sales from
    communications companies. During 2001 and 2002, we invested in
    developing and manufacturing our own semiconductor diodes, one
    of our highest-cost components, rather than purchasing them from
    third-party vendors. Also, we developed new products with higher
    output levels, targeting new applications and markets outside of
    the communications industry, particularly materials processing,
    which is now the largest market for our products.

Description
    of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses

Net sales.

We derive net sales primarily from
    the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode
    lasers, communications systems and complementary products. We
    sell our products through our direct sales organization and our
    network of distributors and sales representatives, as well as
    system integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply
    materials processing laser systems, communications systems and
    medical laser systems to end users. We also sell our products to
    end users that build their own systems which incorporate our
    products or use our products as an energy or light source. Our
    scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs and end users to
    analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber
    laser or amplifier specifications. Our sales cycle varies
    substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long
    as one year or more.

Sales of our products generally are recognized upon shipment,
    provided that no obligations remain and collection of the
    receivable is reasonably assured. Our sales typically are made
    on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase
    commitments.

We develop our products to standard specifications and use a
    common set of components within our product architectures. Our
    major products are based upon a common technology platform. We
    continually enhance these and other products by improving their
    components as well as by developing new components. Although it
    is difficult to predict the life cycles of our products and what
    stage of the life cycle our products are in, we estimate that
    our major products are in the early stages of their life cycles.

The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as
    the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as
    increased competition, the introduction of new products,
    increases in unit volumes and market share considerations. In
    the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to
    penetrate new markets and applications in which previously it
    was not economically feasible for customers to deploy our
    products. Furthermore, we offer volume discounts to customers
    who buy multiple units. We cannot predict the timing and degree
    of these price declines.

Cost of sales.

Our cost of sales consists
    primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct
    labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically
    integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for
    our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe
    our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies,
    leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales
    also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our
    manufacturing and engineering operations, related occupancy and
    equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory
    obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are
    written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as
    excess or obsolete.

Due to our vertical integration strategy, we maintain a
    relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not adjust
    these fixed costs quickly enough to adapt to rapidly changing
    market conditions. Our gross margin is greatly affected by our
    sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed
    manufacturing overhead expenses. Additionally, because many of
    our products are customized, we are frequently required to
    devote significant engineering resources to the sales process,
    which we also include in cost of product sales as incurred.



Sales and marketing.

Our sales and marketing
    expense consists primarily of costs related to compensation,
    trade shows, professional and technical conferences, travel,
    facilities, depreciation of equipment used for demonstration
    purposes and other marketing costs.

Research and development.

Our research and
    development expense consists primarily of compensation,
    development expenses related to the design of our products and
    certain components, and facilities costs. We use a common
    research and development platform for our products. Costs
    related to product development are recorded as research and
    development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

General and administrative.

Our general and
    administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and
    associated costs for executive management, finance, legal and
    other administrative personnel, outside legal and professional
    fees, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses.

Factors
    and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial
    Results

Management believes that the following factors and trends are
    important in understanding our financial statements and overall
    financial performance.

Net sales

Our net sales grew from
    $60.7 million in 2004 to $185.9 million in 2009,
    representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25%.
    Net sales growth was driven by (i) increasing demand for
    our products, fueled by the decreasing average cost per watt of
    output power and resulting increased cost competitiveness
    compared to traditional lasers, (ii) the introduction of
    new products, including our high-power lasers with higher output
    power levels, (iii) the growing market acceptance of fiber
    lasers and (iv) the development of new applications for our
    products and new OEM customer relationships. Our annual revenue
    growth rates have decreased to 21% in 2008 from 32% in 2007, 49%
    in 2006 and 59% in 2005. In 2009, our net sales decreased by 19%
    primarily due, in part, to the global economic downturn.

Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by
    our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials
    processing market, which include automotive, marking,
    electronics and photovoltaic applications. Approximately 76% of
    our revenues in 2009 were from customers in the materials
    processing market. Although applications in this market are
    broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and
    historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For
    the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend
    upon capital expenditures by customers in the materials
    processing market and will be subject to the broader
    fluctuations of capital equipment spending.

Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to
    quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter
    can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers,
    the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our
    customers’ facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time
    orders for products with large purchase prices, and seasonal
    factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity
    throughout the year in the regions where we operate.
    Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half
    of the year than in the first half of the year. Furthermore, net
    sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products
    for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve.
    The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification
    in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a
    period, which may then slow until we further penetrate new
    markets or obtain new customers.

Gross margin.

Our total gross margin in any
    period can be significantly affected by total net sales in any
    period, by product mix, that is, the percentage of our revenue
    in that period that is attributable to higher or lower-power
    products, and by other factors, some of which are not under our
    control.

Our product mix affects our margins because the selling price
    per watt generally is higher for low and mid-power devices than
    for high-power devices. The overall cost of high-power lasers
    may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed overhead
    costs associated with sales of larger volumes of higher-power
    products.

Due to our vertical integration, we have significant fixed costs
    and our costs are difficult to adjust in response to changes in
    demand. Significant decreases in net sales, such as those
    experienced during 2009, will negatively affect gross margins.
    Prior to 2009, gross margins generally improved because of
    increasing sales



and associated greater absorption of fixed overhead costs. Gross
    margin can also vary from quarter to quarter based on changes in
    manufacturing activity levels, which may not be consistent with
    changes in net sales. In periods where work in process and
    finished goods levels increase, there is generally greater
    absorption of manufacturing overhead relative to sales volume,
    which can improve gross margins in those periods. In periods
    where work in process and finished goods levels decrease, there
    is generally less absorption of manufacturing overhead relative
    to sales volume, which can reduce gross margins in those periods.

We also regularly review our inventory for items that are
    slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or determined to be
    excess. Any write-off of such slow-moving, obsolete or excess
    inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded
    provisions for inventory totaling $5.3 million,
    $3.8 million and $2.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The factors that can influence the gross margins derived from
    sales of any individual product include the following:

•

factors that affect the prices we can charge, including the
    features and performance of our products, their output power,
    the nature of the end user and application, and competitive
    pressures;

•

factors that affect the cost of our net sales, including the
    cost of raw materials and components, manufacturing costs and
    shipping costs;

•

production volumes and yields of specific product lines or
    components; and

•

in the case of our OEM customers, the type of market that they
    serve and the competitive pricing pressures faced by our OEM
    customers.

Cost of diodes.

Prior to 2004, we used
    semiconductor diodes purchased from a third-party supplier. In
    2004, we began production at our semiconductor diode
    manufacturing facility, which enabled us to significantly reduce
    the cost of our semiconductor diodes and eliminate reliance upon
    suppliers for this component. For many of our products,
    particularly at higher power levels, the cost of diodes is the
    most important factor in determining the price of the product.
    In addition, since 2004 we have continually increased the output
    power of individual semiconductor diodes and diode packages,
    further reducing our cost per watt.

Sales and marketing expense.

We have expanded
    our worldwide direct sales organization, opened applications
    centers around the world, hired additional personnel involved in
    marketing in our existing and new geographic locations,
    increased the number of units used for demonstration purposes,
    and otherwise increased expenditures on sales and marketing
    activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. We
    expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing
    resources and such costs may increase in the aggregate. However,
    the rate of growth in such costs is not expected to be as high
    as rates experienced in previous years.

Research and development expense.

We plan to
    continue to invest in research and development to improve our
    existing components and products and develop new components and
    products, such as diodes, gas lasers and visible lasers. The
    amount of research and development expenses we incur may vary
    period to period.

General and administrative expense.

We have
    increased our general and administrative expenses and expanded
    headcount to support the growth of our company and to comply
    with public company reporting obligations and regulatory
    requirements, incurred higher insurance expenses related to
    directors’ and officers’ insurance and invested in our
    financial reporting systems. We expect future increases in
    general and administrative expenses to be limited, however the
    timing and amount of litigation-related expenses may vary
    substantially from quarter to quarter in response to the level
    of litigation activity and other unforeseen circumstances and
    events.

Major customers.

We have historically depended
    on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net
    sales. The composition of this group can change from year to
    year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a
    percentage of our annual net sales were 12% in 2009, 17% in 2008
    and 20% in 2007. Sales to our largest customer accounted for 3%,
    7% and 7% of our net sales in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships
    with existing customers. We



anticipate that the composition of our net sales to our
    significant customers will continue to change. If any of our
    significant customers were to substantially reduce their
    purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales
    and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are
    subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing
    basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those
    related to inventories, income taxes and the fair value of
    certain debt and equity instruments including stock-based
    compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on our
    historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe
    are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
    form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and
    financial position. The accounting policies described below are
    those which, in our opinion, involve the most significant
    application of judgment, or involve complex estimation, and
    which could, if different judgments or estimates were made,
    materially affect our reported results of operations and
    financial position.

Revenue recognition.

Our net sales are
    generated from sales of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, diode
    lasers and complementary products. Our products are used in a
    wide range of applications by different types of end users or
    used as components integrated into systems by OEMs or system
    integrators. We also sell communications systems that include
    our fiber lasers and amplifiers as components.

We recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met:
    (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
    (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable; and
    (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from the
    sale of our products is generally recognized upon shipment,
    provided that the other revenue recognition criteria have been
    met. We have no obligation to provide upgrades, enhancements or
    customer support subsequent to the sale, other than warranty.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. We defer the revenue on multiple element arrangements if
    the fair values of all the undelivered elements are not known or
    if customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of specified
    items or performance conditions, if the performance conditions
    cannot be satisfactorily tested prior to shipment or if we have
    not met such conditions in the past. Applicable revenue
    recognition criteria are then applied separately to each
    separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. We receive a customer purchase
    order or contract as evidence of an arrangement and product
    shipment terms are typically free on board (F.O.B.) shipping
    point. Periodically, our revenue arrangements include customer
    acceptance clauses. If an acceptance clause defines a
    performance requirement in a process or application that we
    cannot effectively test prior to delivery or that has not been
    accepted previously, we defer recognition of revenue until the
    performance requirement has been proved.

Inventory.

Inventory is stated at the lower of
    cost

(first-in,

first-out method) or market. Inventory includes parts and
    components that may be specialized in nature and subject to
    rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for inventory items to
    provide for an estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory.
    The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on
    hand, which we compare with estimated future usage and age. In
    addition, we review the inventory and compare recorded costs
    with estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded
    to reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with
    respect to any part with costs in excess of current market
    value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently
    difficult, particularly given that we make unique components and
    products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete
    inventory by making our best estimate considering the current
    quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for
    this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often
    have



limited information on which to base our forecasts. If future
    sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and
    obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory
    provisions may be required. Because of our vertical integration,
    a significant or sudden decrease in sales could result in a
    significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete
    inventory. We recorded inventory charges of $5.3 million,
    $3.8 million and $2.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

We allocate and record stock-based compensation expense on a
    straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the appropriate
    fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based
    payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions,
    including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards
    and stock price volatility. The assumptions used to calculate
    the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent
    management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve
    inherent uncertainties and the application of management
    judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different
    assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be
    materially different in the future. The weighted average
    assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were as follows for
    the years ended December 31:

The weighted average expected option term for awards granted in
    2007 reflects the application of the simplified method set forth
    in Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin,
    or SAB, No. 107. The simplified method defines the life as
    the average of the contractual term of the options and the
    weighted average vesting period for all option tranches.
    Commencing in 2008, we began using historic exercise activities
    of its own stock options as well as projections based on
    historic experience.

For options granted with an expected term shorter than the
    history of Company-specific trading data, the Company-specific
    historical and implied volatility was used to calculate expected
    volatility. For options granted with an expected term longer
    than the available history of Company-specific trading data, the
    trading data of similar entities whose share prices are publicly
    available was used to calculate expected volatility. We used the
    following factors to identify similar public entities: industry,
    stage of life cycle, size and profitability. We intend to
    continue to consistently apply this process using the same or
    similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical
    information regarding the volatility of its own share price
    becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the
    identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter
    case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.

As stock-based compensation expense recorded in our statements
    of operations is based on options ultimately expected to vest,
    it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate
    forfeitures at the time of



grant and revise these estimates, if necessary, in subsequent
    periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates.

We have offered an employee stock purchase plan covering our
    U.S. and German employees. The plan allows employees who
    participate to purchase shares of common stock through payroll
    deductions at a 15% discount to the lower of the stock price on
    the first day or last day of the six-month purchase period.
    Payroll deductions may not exceed 10% of the employee’s
    compensation. Compensation expense related to the employee stock
    purchase plan for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008 was approximately $205,000 and $67,000, respectively.

Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes.

Our annual
    tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax
    planning opportunities available to us in the various
    jurisdictions in which we operate.

We file federal and state income tax returns in the United
    States and tax returns in nine international jurisdictions. We
    must estimate our income tax expense after considering, among
    other factors, differing tax rates between jurisdictions,
    allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes
    in enacted tax rates. Significant judgment is required in
    determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax
    positions. As we continue to expand globally, there is a risk
    that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various
    jurisdictions in which we do business, a governmental agency may
    disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes.
    Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the
    foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations
    where the tax treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is
    different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that
    the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another
    jurisdiction.

Deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” The tax effects of these
    temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and
    deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At
    December 31, 2009, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of
    $9,926,000. If insufficient evidence of our ability to generate
    future taxable income arises, we may be required to record a
    valuation allowance against these assets, which will result in
    additional income tax expense. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate
    whether the deferred tax assets may be realized in the future
    and assess the need for a valuation allowance.

We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax
    authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues.
    Reserves recorded are based on a determination of whether and
    how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or
    positions is “more likely than not” to be realized
    following resolution of any potential contingencies present
    related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question
    will be raised by the tax authorities. Potential interest and
    penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is
    recorded as a component of income tax expense. At
    December 31, 2009, we had unrecognized tax benefits of
    approximately $2,131,000 that, if recognized, would be recorded
    as a reduction in income tax expense.

Additionally, undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are
    accounted for as a temporary difference, except that deferred
    tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a
    foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested
    in the foreign jurisdiction. We have formulated a specific plan
    for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign
    subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be
    indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2009 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Net sales.

Net sales decreased by
    $43.2 million, or 18.9%, to $185.9 million in 2009
    from $229.1 million in 2008. This decrease was attributable
    to the global economic downturn and lower average sales prices,
    which reduced sales of fiber lasers in materials processing
    applications, where net sales decreased by $46.9 million or
    25.0%, and a decrease in sales of communications applications,
    where net sales decreased by $2.0 million or 15.8%. These
    decreases were partially offset by the increases in sales of
    medical applications, where net sales increased by
    $3.8 million, or over 100%, and sales of advanced
    applications, where net sales increased by $1.9 million or
    7.6%. The decrease in materials processing applications sales
    resulted from substantially decreased sales of pulsed lasers and
    medium-power lasers used in marking, engraving and drilling
    applications due to the global economic downturn. The decrease
    in communications applications sales resulted primarily from
    decreased sales of amplifiers, particularly in Russia. The
    increase in medical application sales is due to the increased
    demand from our established customer in the U.S. and new
    OEM customers. The increase in sales of advanced applications
    was due to higher sales of high-power lasers used in government
    and defense research and pulsed and low-power lasers used for
    sensing and optical pumping applications.



Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of sales
    decreased by $0.2 million, or 0.1%, to $121.6 million
    in 2009 from $121.8 million in 2008. Our gross margin
    decreased to 34.6% in 2009 from 46.8% in 2008. The decrease in
    gross margin was the result of less favorable absorption of our
    fixed manufacturing costs due to a decline in sales volume, less
    favorable product mix due to proportionately lower sales of
    medium-power lasers, a reduction in inventory, increases in
    charges related to inventory write-downs and lower prices due to
    pricing pressure caused by the industry-wide reduction in
    demand. These costs of sales increases were offset partially by
    a reduction in manufacturing expenses in the period, primarily
    related to reduced salary and benefits expense and other
    manufacturing supplies. Expenses related to inventory reserves
    and other valuation adjustments increased by $1.5 million
    to $5.3 million, or 2.9%, of sales in 2009 as compared to
    $3.8 million, or 1.7%, of sales in 2008. The increase in
    inventory reserves in 2009 was due in part to the decline in
    sales and corresponding usage of inventory as well as the impact
    of a new generation of diodes on usage levels of the previous
    generation.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $1.3 million, or 9.0%, to
    $15.2 million in 2009 from $13.9 million in 2008,
    primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation costs of
    products used for demonstration purposes and travel expenses. As
    a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to
    8.2% in 2009 from 6.1% in 2008. As we continue to expand our
    worldwide sales organization, we expect expenditures on sales
    and marketing to continue to increase in the aggregate although
    the near-term increases may be more moderate.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $2.7 million, or 17.3%, to
    $18.5 million in 2009 from $15.8 million in 2008. This
    increase was primarily due to increases of $1.5 million in
    material costs, $0.5 million in salaries and benefits and
    $0.5 million in depreciation. Research and development
    activity continues to focus on enhancing the performance of our
    internally manufactured components, refining production
    processes to improve manufacturing yields, the development of
    new products operating at different wavelengths and higher
    output powers and new complementary accessories used with our
    products. As a percentage of sales, research and development
    expense increased to 10.0% in 2009 from 6.9% in 2008. We expect
    that research and development expenses will increase moderately
    in absolute dollars in 2010, however they could vary from
    quarter to quarter.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expense decreased by $2.7 million, or
    11.7%, to $20.5 million in 2009 from $23.2 million in
    2008, primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in
    accounting and legal defense fees and a $1.6 million
    decrease in personnel and contractor expenses primarily
    attributable to lower incentive compensation. We expect that
    legal expenses will increase in future quarters in connection
    with defending two patent infringement actions that were brought
    against us. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative
    expense increased to 11.0% in 2009 from 10.1% in 2008.

Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating
    expenses.

We estimate that if exchange rates had
    been the same as one year ago, sales in 2009 would have been
    $1.5 million higher, gross margin would have been
    $2.1 million higher and operating expenses in total would
    have been $0.9 million higher. The measures that assume
    constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year
    2008 are calculated using the average exchange rates for the
    twelve-month period ended December 31, 2008 for the
    respective currencies, which were Euro 1=US$1.47, Japanese
    Yen 1= US$0.01 and Russian Ruble 1=US$0.04.

Loss (gain) on foreign exchange.

We incurred a
    foreign exchange loss of $1.0 million in 2009 as compared
    to a gain of $2.8 million in 2008. The change was primarily
    attributable to the depreciation of the Euro against the
    U.S. Dollar.

Interest (expense) income, net.

Interest
    expense, net was $1.3 million in 2009 compared to
    $0.8 million in 2008. Interest expense increased in 2009
    because of higher drawings on our credit lines, particularly
    during the first half of the year.

Provision for income taxes.

Provision for
    income taxes was $2.5 million in 2009 compared to
    $18.1 million in 2008, representing an effective tax rate
    of 32.0% in both 2009 and 2008.

Net income.

Net income attributable to IPG
    Photonics Corporation decreased by $31.3 million to
    $5.4 million in 2009 from $36.7 million in 2008. Net
    income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a



percentage of our net sales decreased by 13.0 percentage
    points to 3.0% in 2009 from 16.0% in 2008 due to the factors
    described above.

Comparison
    of Year Ended December 31, 2008 to Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net sales.

Net sales increased by
    $40.4 million, or 21.4%, to $229.1 million in 2008
    from $188.7 million in 2007. This increase was attributable
    to higher sales of fiber lasers in materials processing
    applications where net sales increased by $47.7 million, or
    34.0%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales
    in medical applications of $6.7 million, or 64.1%, advanced
    applications of $0.4 million, or 1.5%, and communications
    applications, where net sales decreased by $0.2 million, or
    1.2%. The growth in materials processing applications sales
    resulted primarily from increased sales of medium-power lasers
    and pulsed lasers and continued market penetration for
    high-power fiber lasers, which increased by 55.5%, 37.5% and
    29.4%, respectively. The decrease in sales of medical
    applications and low-power lasers was due to lower sales to our
    largest medical application customer in the United States.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of sales
    increased by $18.1 million, or 17.4%, to
    $121.8 million in 2008 from $103.7 million in 2007, as
    a result of increased sales volume. Our gross margin increased
    to 46.8% in 2008 from 45.0% in 2007. The increase in gross
    margin resulted from favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing
    costs due to higher production volumes and favorable product
    mix, particularly related to pulsed and medium-power lasers.
    These products have a higher selling price of output power per
    watt and higher gross margins. These benefits were partially
    offset by inventory write-downs of $3.8 million compared to
    $2.5 million in 2007 and an increase in depreciation
    related to facilities and equipment of $2.5 million in 2008.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and
    marketing expense increased by $3.8 million, or 37.6%, to
    $13.9 million in 2008 from $10.1 million in 2007,
    primarily as a result of an increase of $1.8 million in
    personnel costs and $0.5 million in premises costs related
    to a larger worldwide direct sales organization, including our
    new sales and applications facilities in China, Japan and the
    United States (Michigan) and additional sales personnel
    worldwide. Additionally, the increase resulted from a
    $0.6 million increase in depreciation related to facilities
    and units used for demonstration purposes. As a percentage of
    sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 6.1% in 2008
    compared to 5.4% in 2007.

Research and development expense.

Research and
    development expense increased by $6.3 million, or 65.9%, to
    $15.8 million in 2008 from $9.5 million in 2007. This
    increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.6 million
    in personnel costs and $2.1 million in materials used for
    research and development projects. During 2008, we increased the
    number of personnel performing research and development
    activities in the United States, Germany and Russia. Research
    and development activity continues to focus on enhancing the
    performance of our internally manufactured components, refining
    production processes to improve manufacturing yields and the
    development of new products. As a percentage of sales, research
    and development expense increased to 6.9% in 2008 from 5.0% in
    2007.

General and administrative expense.

General
    and administrative expense increased by $1.4 million, or
    7.2%, to $20.4 million in 2008 from $19.0 million in
    2007, primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in personnel
    expenses as we expanded the general and administrative function
    to support the growth of the business, $0.9 million related
    to higher consulting fees and $0.9 million related to the
    increase in bad debt reserves. These increases were offset by an
    increase in gains on foreign currency transactions, which
    increased to $2.8 million in 2008 from $1.2 million in
    2007. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative
    expense decreased to 8.9% in 2008 compared to 10.1% in 2007.

Interest (expense) income, net.

Interest
    (expense) income, net was $0.8 million of net interest
    expense in 2008 compared to $0.7 million of net interest
    income in 2007. Interest expense in 2008 totaled
    $1.7 million while interest income was $0.9 million.
    The change in interest (expense) income, net resulted from
    higher interest expense due to increased utilization of credit
    lines.



(

Provision for) benefit from income taxes.

The
    provision for income taxes increased by $2.6 million to an
    $18.1 million expense in 2008 from a $15.5 million
    expense in 2007. The effective tax rate was 32.0% in 2008 as
    compared to 32.6% in 2007.

Net income.

Net income increased by
    $6.8 million to $36.7 million in 2008 from
    $29.9 million in 2007. Net income as a percentage of our
    net sales increased to 16.0% in 2008 compared to 15.8% in 2007.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2009
    consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $82.9 million,
    unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of
    $54.3 million and working capital (excluding cash) of
    $61.2 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents
    of $51.3 million, unused credit lines and overdraft
    facilities of $40.9 million and working capital (excluding
    cash) of $80.7 million as of December 31, 2008. The
    increase in cash and cash equivalents of $31.6 million from
    December 31, 2008 relates primarily to cash provided by
    operating activities in 2009 of $54.3 million, offset by
    credit line repayments of $13.8 million and capital
    expenditures of $10.5 million.

We held approximately $1.3 million in auction-rate
    securities (ARSs) at December 31, 2009, all of which are
    included in other long-term assets. Our investments in ARSs at
    December 31, 2009 consisted solely of taxable municipal
    debt securities, which are classified as long-term available for
    sale securities due to continued auction failures.

Our long-term debt consists of an $18.0 million secured
    variable-rate note that matures in July 2013. The note is
    secured by a mortgage on real estate and buildings that we own
    in Massachusetts.

We expect that the existing cash and marketable securities, our
    cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit will
    be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital needs for the
    foreseeable future. Our future long-term capital requirements
    will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the
    impact of economic recessions on our sales levels, the timing
    and extent of spending to support development efforts, the
    expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and
    introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to
    adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market
    acceptance of our products. We have made no arrangements to
    obtain additional financing, and there is no assurance that such
    additional financing, if required or desired, will be available
    in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

    syndicated.



We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated
    with its U.S. revolving line of credit and long term debt
    facilities. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt
    service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before
    interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (“EBITDA”) ratio. The debt service coverage covenant
    requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash
    flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is
    defined as required principal and interest payments during the
    period. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital
    expenditures. For trailing twelve month periods until June 2010,
    up to $15.0 million of our capital expenditures are treated
    as being funded from the proceeds of our initial public
    offering. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the
    sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated
    basis shall be less than two times our trailing twelve months
    EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants
    as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009.

The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to
    not take or to delay investments and actions that we might
    otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures
    and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do
    not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in
    default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may
    result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt
    or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm
    our results of operations and financial condition.

In January 2010, we completed the acquisition of Photonics
    Innovations, Inc., a maker of active and passive laser materials
    and tunable lasers for scientific, biomedical, technological,
    and eye-safe range-finding applications. The acquisition of
    Photonics Innovations, Inc was not material to our liquidity or
    financial position.

Operating activities.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $19.7 million to
    $54.4 million in 2009 from $34.7 million in 2008,
    primarily resulting from:

•

A decrease in inventory of $5.6 million in 2009 compared to
    an increase of inventory of $21.7 million in 2008;

•

A decrease in accounts receivable of $9.3 million in 2009
    compared to an increase of $8.5 million in 2008; partially
    offset by

•

A decrease in cash provided by net income after adding back
    non-cash charges of $27.2 million in 2009 as compared to
    2008.

Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming
    testing procedures for both internally manufactured and
    externally purchased components and the lead time required to
    manufacture components used in our finished product, the rate at
    which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared
    to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required
    investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us
    to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what
    we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was
    a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key
    technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to
    continue to build finished products for a period of time. We
    believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high
    level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result,
    we expect to have a significant amount of working capital
    invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or
    the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels
    would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our
    inventory into cash would decrease.

Investing activities.

Net cash used in
    investing activities was $10.6 million and
    $31.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The cash used
    in investing activities in 2009 was related to capital
    expenditures on property, plant and equipment. The cash used in
    2008 was primarily related to capital expenditures on property,
    plant and equipment and intangible assets of $37.1 million,
    partially offset by $5.5 million of proceeds from the sale
    of marketable securities. In 2009 and 2008, capital expenditures
    in the United States, Germany and Russia related to facilities
    and equipment for diode wafer growth, burn-in test stations and
    packaging as well as new fiber and component production
    facilities.

We expect to incur approximately $25 million in capital
    expenditures, including acquisitions, in 2010. The timing and
    extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can
    have a significant effect on our



cash flow. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we
    undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or
    defer to a later period.

Financing activities.

Net cash used by
    financing activities was $12.3 million in 2009 as compared
    to net cash provided by financing activities of
    $10.5 million in 2008. The cash used by financing
    activities in 2009 was primarily related to the net repayments
    of $13.8 million from the use of our credit lines and cash
    used to purchase non-controlling interests of $0.5 million,
    partially offset by $3.4 million of exercise of stock
    options and related tax benefits. The cash provided by financing
    activities in 2008 was primarily related to the net proceeds of
    $7.8 million from the use of our credit lines.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 168,

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and
    the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
    Principles — a replacement of FASB Statement
    No. 162

. SFAS No. 168 made the FASB
    Accounting Standards Codification (the Codification) the single
    source of U.S. GAAP used by nongovernmental entities in the
    preparation of financial statements, except for rules and
    interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal
    securities laws, which are sources of authoritative accounting
    guidance for SEC registrants. The Codification is meant to
    simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by
    reorganizing U.S. GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90
    accounting topics within a consistent structure; its purpose is
    not to create new accounting and reporting guidance. The
    Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and
    reporting standards and was effective for us beginning
    July 1, 2009. Following SFAS No. 168, the FASB
    will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB
    Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts;
    instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates. The FASB
    will not consider Accounting Standards Updates as authoritative
    in their own right; these updates will serve only to update the
    Codification, provide background information about the guidance,
    and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the
    Codification. In the description of Accounting Standards Updates
    that follows, references in “italics” relate to
    Codification Topics and Subtopics, and their descriptive titles,
    as appropriate.

In March 2008, the FASB issued standards requiring further
    disclosure on derivative instruments and hedging activities. The
    new standards apply to all derivative instruments and
    non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as
    hedging instruments and related hedged items. The new standards
    require



additional disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses
    derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and
    related hedged items are accounted for and (c) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, results of operations, and
    cash flows. These standards were effective for us beginning
    January 1, 2009.

Effective June 30, 2009, we adopted a new FASB standard on
    disclosure related to financial instruments, FASB ASC 825,

Financial Instruments,

which requires disclosures about
    fair value of financial instruments in interim reporting periods
    as well as in annual financial statements. The adoption of the
    new standard required us to provide additional disclosures.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of
    business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk
    associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt and
    foreign exchange rate risk.

Interest rate risk.

Our investments have
    limited exposure to market risk. To minimize this risk, we
    maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market
    funds and short-term government funds. The interest rates are
    variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because
    of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change
    in market interest rates would not be expected to have a
    material impact on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

Our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or
    decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our
    bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. The
    interest rate on our existing bank debt is effectively fixed
    except for our U.S. revolving line of credit. The rates on
    our Euro overdraft facilities in Germany and Italy and our
    Japanese Yen overdraft facility are fixed for twelve-month
    periods. Approximately 75% of our outstanding debt had a fixed
    rate of interest as of December 31, 2009. We do not believe
    that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material
    impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Exchange rates.

Due to our international
    operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of
    sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other
    than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro, the Japanese
    Yen and the Russian Ruble. As a result, our international
    operations give rise to transactional market risk associated
    with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar, the Euro,
    the Japanese Yen and the Russian Ruble. Gains and losses on
    foreign exchange transactions totaled a $1.0 million loss
    in 2009 and a $2.8 million gain in 2008. Management
    believes that the use of foreign currency financial instruments
    reduces the risks of certain foreign currency transactions;
    however, these instruments provide only limited protection. We
    will continue to analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate
    fluctuations and may engage in additional financial hedging
    techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of
    these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may
    adversely affect our financial results in the future. No foreign
    currency derivative instruments were outstanding at
    December 31, 2009.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our
    Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    “disclosure controls and procedures” (as



defined in

Rules 13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the
    period covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

(the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation,
    our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
    concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
    we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit
    under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
    Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    (as defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f))

for the Company and its subsidiaries. Internal control over
    financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
    assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
    the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
    management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our
    internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation
    Date based on criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that,
    as of the Evaluation Date, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited our internal
    control over financial reporting, as stated in their report
    below.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

There was no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal
    quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations
    on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management (including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer) does not expect that the disclosure controls
    and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting
    will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
    system must reflect the fact that there are resource
    constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
    relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all
    control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
    assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of
    fraud, if any, within the company have been or will be detected.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, MA

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 of the Company and our report dated
    March 15, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and
    the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results
    of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
    in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated March 15, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

NATURE OF
    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Nature of Business

— IPG Photonics Corporation
    (the “Company”) designs and manufactures a broad line
    of high-performance fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers for
    diverse applications in numerous markets, such as materials
    processing, advanced applications, communications and medical.
    Our world headquarters are located in Oxford, Massachusetts. We
    also have facilities and sales offices elsewhere in the United
    States, Europe and Asia.

Principles of Consolidation

— We were
    incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1998. The
    accompanying financial statements include the accounts of us and
    our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated.

Noncontrolling Interests

— Effective
    January 1, 2009, we adopted new guidance to account for
    noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries. The new guidance
    was retrospectively applied, and

•

clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an
    ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be
    reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements,

•

requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that
    include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the
    noncontrolling interest,

•

establishes standards for accounting for changes in a
    parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary, and

•

requires expanded disclosures that clearly identify and
    distinguish between interests of the parent’s owners and
    the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary.

The calculation of earnings per share continues to be based on
    income amounts attributable to the parent. The changes in
    presentation prescribed by the new guidance have been reflected
    in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December
    31 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of
    income, cash flows and equity for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
    of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
    period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

— The financial information
    for entities outside the United States is measured using local
    currencies as the functional currency, except for our Russian
    subsidiary, for which the functional currency is the
    U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the
    respective balance sheet dates. Income and expenses are
    translated into U.S. dollars based on the average rate of
    exchange for the corresponding period. Exchange rate differences
    resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for
    directly as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income except in Russia where translation gains and losses are
    reported in net income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash and cash
    equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments, such
    as bank deposits, with insignificant interest rate risk and
    remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of
    acquisition.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market on a

first-in,

first-out basis. Inventories include parts and components that
    may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence.
    We periodically review the quantities and carrying values of
    inventories to assess whether the inventories are recoverable.
    Because of our vertical integration, a significant or sudden
    decrease in sales activity could result in a significant change
    in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation. The
    costs associated with

F-7


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

provisions for excess quantities, technological obsolescence, or
    component rejection are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

— Property,
    plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line
    method based on the estimated useful lives of the related
    assets. In the case of leasehold improvements, the estimated
    useful lives of the related assets do not exceed the remaining
    terms of the corresponding leases. The following table presents
    the assigned economic useful lives of property, plant, and
    equipment:

Economic

Category

Useful Life

Buildings

30 years

Machinery and equipment

3-5 years

Office furniture and fixtures

3-5 years

Other assets

3-5 years

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
    operations. Interest expense associated with significant capital
    projects is capitalized as a cost of the project. We capitalized
    $75,000, $390,000 and $186,000 of interest expense in 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

— Long-lived assets, which
    consist primarily of property, plant, and equipment, are
    reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. In cases in which undiscounted expected future cash
    flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is
    recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds
    the fair value of assets. No impairment losses have been
    recorded during the periods presented.

Included in other long-term assets is certain demonstration
    equipment as well as intangible assets, comprised of purchased
    technologies and customer relationships. The demonstration
    equipment and intangible assets are amortized over the
    respective estimated economic lives, generally 3 years for
    demonstration equipment and 5 years for intangible assets.
    The carrying value of the demonstration equipment totaled
    $8.9 million and $6.8 million, at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Amortization expense for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3.6 million and
    $2.7 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

— We recognize revenue when
    four basic criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an
    arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services
    have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable;
    and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue from
    the sale of our products is generally recognized upon shipment,
    provided that the other revenue recognition criteria have been
    met. We have no obligation to provide upgrades, enhancements or
    customer support subsequent to the sale, other than warranty.

Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into
    separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. The
    consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the
    separate units of accounting based on their relative fair
    values. We defer revenue on multiple element arrangements if the
    fair values of the undelivered elements are not known or if
    customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of specified items
    or performance conditions that cannot be satisfactorily tested
    prior to shipment or if we have not met such conditions in the
    past. Applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied
    separately for each separate unit of accounting.

Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as
    a reduction to revenue. Rights of return are generally not
    included in sales arrangements. Generally, we receive a customer
    purchase order as evidence of an arrangement and product
    shipment terms are free on board (F.O.B.) shipping point.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— We maintain
    an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated
    amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The
    allowance is based upon an assessment of customer
    creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of
    outstanding receivables.

Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was as

Warranties

— In general, our products carry a
    warranty against defect for a period of one to three years,
    depending upon the product type and customer negotiations. The
    expected cost associated with these warranty obligations is
    recorded when the revenue is recognized. The warranty accrual is
    reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets. Activity related to the warranty

Advertising Expense

— The cost of advertising
    is expensed as incurred. We conduct substantially all of its
    sales and marketing efforts through trade shows, professional
    and technical conferences, direct sales and use of its website.
    Our advertising costs were not significant for the periods
    presented.

Research and Development

— Research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net
    operating loss carryforwards and credits using enacted rates in
    effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
    allowances are provided against deferred tax assets that are not
    deemed to be recoverable. We recognize tax positions that are
    more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by
    relevant tax authorities. The tax positions are measured at the
    greatest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent
    likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax
    authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues.
    The reserves are based on a determination of whether and how
    much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or
    positions is more likely than not to be realized following
    resolution of uncertainties related to the tax benefit, assuming
    that the matter in question will be raised by the tax
    authorities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— Financial
    instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist
    primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities
    and accounts receivable. We maintain substantially all of its
    cash and marketable securities in six financial institutions,
    which are believed to be high-credit, quality financial
    institutions. We grant credit to customers in the ordinary
    course of business and provides a reserve for potential credit
    losses. Such losses historically have been within
    management’s expectations (see discussion related to
    significant customers in Note 14).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— Our
    financial instruments consist of accounts receivable, auction
    rate securities, accounts payable, drawings on revolving lines
    of credit, long-term debt and certain derivative instruments. We
    adopted the new guidance relating to fair value measurements and
    disclosures effective

F-10


IPG
    PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

January 1, 2008. This guidance clarifies the definition of
    fair value, prescribes methods for measuring fair value,
    establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to
    measure fair value and expands disclosures about the use of fair
    value measurements.

The valuation techniques utilized are based upon observable and
    unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data
    obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
    reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs
    create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1, defined
    as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical
    instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs
    other than quoted prices in active markets that are either
    directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as
    unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists,
    therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable
    and drawings on revolving lines of credit are considered
    reasonable estimates of their fair market value, due to the
    short maturity of these instruments or as a result of the
    competitive market interest rates, which have been negotiated.
    Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for bank
    loans with similar terms and average maturities as our long-term
    debt, the fair value of long-term debt was $18.0 million at
    December 31, 2009.

    liabilities measured at fair value:

    current market rates. Fair value at December 31, 2009 for
    the auction rate securities was determined using an analysis of
    discounted cash.

The assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using

Derivative Instruments

— Our primary market
    exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We
    may use certain derivative financial instruments to help manage
    these exposures. We execute these instruments with financial
    institutions we judge to be credit-worthy. We do not hold or
    issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes.

We recognize all derivative financial instruments as either
    assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance
    sheet. We have used foreign currency forward contracts as cash
    flow hedges of forecasted intercompany settlements denominated
    in foreign currencies of major industrial countries. We have no
    outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. We have an
    interest rate swap that is classified as a cash flow hedge of
    our variable rate debt.

Business Segment Information

— We operate in
    one segment which involves the design, development, production
    and distribution of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and related
    optical components. We have a single, company-wide management
    team that administers all properties as a whole rather than as
    discrete operating segments. The chief decision maker, who is
    our Chief Executive Officer, measures financial performance as a
    single enterprise and not on legal entity or end-market basis.
    Throughout the year, the chief decision maker allocates capital
    resources on a

project-by-project

basis across our entire asset base to maximize profitability
    without regard to legal entity or end-market basis. We operate
    in a number of countries throughout the world in a variety of
    product lines. Information regarding geographic financial
    information and product lines is provided in Note 14.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

— In June
    2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 168,

The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy
    of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles — a
    replacement of FASB Statement No. 162

.
    SFAS No. 168 made the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification (the Codification) the single source of
    U.S. GAAP used by nongovernmental entities in the
    preparation of financial statements, except for rules and
    interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal
    securities laws, which are sources of authoritative accounting
    guidance for SEC registrants. The Codification is meant to
    simplify user access to all authoritative accounting guidance by
    reorganizing U.S. GAAP pronouncements into roughly 90
    accounting topics within a consistent structure; its purpose is
    not to create new accounting and reporting guidance. The
    Codification supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and
    reporting standards and was effective for us beginning
    July 1, 2009. Following SFAS No. 168, the Board
    will not issue new standards in the form of Statements, FASB
    Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts;
    instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates. The FASB
    will not consider Accounting Standards Updates as authoritative
    in their own right; these updates will serve only to update the
    Codification, provide background information about the guidance,
    and provide the bases for conclusions on the change(s) in the
    Codification.

Compensation cost for all share-based payment awards is based on
    the estimated grant-date fair value. We allocate and record
    stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over
    the requisite service period.

We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the appropriate
    fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based
    payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions,
    including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards
    and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating
    the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent
    management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve
    inherent uncertainties and the application of management
    judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different
    assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be
    materially different in the future. The weighted average
    assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were as follows for
    the years ended December 31:

Due to insufficient historical experience, the weighted average
    expected option term for awards granted in 2007 reflects the
    application of the simplified method set forth in Securities and
    Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB,
    No. 107. The simplified method defines the life as the
    average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted
    average vesting period for all option tranches. Commencing in
    2008, we began to use historic exercise activities of its own
    stock options as well as projections based on historic
    experience to determine the expected option term.

There is a lack of sufficient company-specific historical and
    implied volatility information for options granted with an
    expected term that is longer than the period for which our stock
    has been publically traded. For these awards we based our
    estimate of expected volatility on the expected volatility of
    similar entities whose share prices are publicly available. We
    used the following factors to identify similar public entities:
    industry, stage of life cycle, size and profitability. We intend
    to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or
    similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical
    information regarding the volatility of its own share price
    becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the
    identified entities are no longer similar to us. In this latter
    case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are
    publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. There
    were option awards made in 2009 for which the expected term is

shorter than the period for which our stock has been publically
    traded. For these awards, the company-specific historical and
    implied volatility information was used.

Incentive Plans

— In April 2000, our board of
    directors adopted the 2000 Incentive Compensation Plan, or 2000
    plan, and in February 2006, our board of directors adopted the
    2006 Incentive Compensation Plan, or 2006 plan, which provide
    for the issuance of stock options and other stock and non-stock
    based awards to our directors, employees, consultants and
    advisors. We reserved 5,833,333 shares under the 2000 plan
    and 4,000,000 shares under the 2006 plan for the issuance
    of awards under the plans. In June 2006, our board of directors
    adopted the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the
    “Directors Plan”). Only non-employee directors are
    eligible to receive awards under the Directors Plan. We reserved
    166,666 shares for issuance under the Directors Plan. Under
    the three plans, we may grant nonstatutory stock options at an
    exercise price at least equal to the fair value of our common
    stock on the date of grant, unless the board of directors or
    compensation committee determines otherwise on the date of
    grant. Incentive stock options may be granted under the 2000
    plan and the 2006 plan at exercise prices equal to or exceeding
    the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options
    generally become exercisable over periods of one to five years
    and expire seven to ten years from the date of the grant. The
    awards under the 2000 plan and the 2006 plan may become
    exercisable earlier upon the occurrence of certain change of
    control events at the election of the board of directors or
    compensation committee, and all awards under the Directors Plan
    automatically become exercisable upon a change of control. All
    shares issued under the stock option plans are registered shares
    newly issued by us. At December 31, 2009,
    1,812,829 shares were available for future grant under the
    three option plans.

U.S. Line of Credit

— We maintain an
    unsecured revolving line of credit with available principal of
    up to $35,000,000 expiring in July 2011. The line of credit
    bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 0.8% to 1.2%
    depending on our financial performance (1.0% at
    December 31, 2009). $12.0 million of this credit
    facility is available to foreign subsidiaries including India,
    China, Japan and Korea. Total drawings at December 31, 2009
    were $5.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of
    3.7% At December 31, 2009, the remaining availability under
    the U.S. Line of Credit totaled $29,970,000.

Euro Line of Credit —

In October 2007, we
    entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit with a
    principal amount of Euro 15,000,000 (approximately
    $21,499,000 at December 31, 2009). The credit facility
    bears interest at various rates based upon the type of loan and
    matures in June 2010. No amounts were drawn on the Euro Line of
    Credit during 2009 and 2008.

Euro Overdraft Facilities

— We maintain a
    syndicated overdraft facility with available principal of
    Euro 850,000 (approximately $1,218,000 at December 31,
    2009). This amount is available through September 2010. This
    facility bears interest at market rates that vary depending upon
    the bank within the syndicate that advances the principal
    outstanding (6.5% at December 31, 2009). This facility is
    collateralized by a common pool of the assets of our German
    subsidiary, IPG Laser GmbH.

Other European Facilities

— We maintain two
    Euro credit lines in Italy with aggregate available principal of
    Euro 1,475,000 (approximately $2,114,000 as of
    December 31, 2009) which bear interest at rates
    ranging from 2.62% to 2.82% and expiration dates between March
    and July 2010. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate
    remaining availability under the Euro credit lines was
    $1,137,000. These facilities are collateralized by a common pool
    of the assets of our Italian subsidiary, IPG Photonics (Italy)
    S.r.l. (“IPG Italy”). There were no outstanding
    borrowings at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Term
    Debt:

U.S. Long-Term Note

— In 2008, we
    refinanced its subordinated notes with a U.S Long-Term Note.
    Outstanding principal under the U.S. Long-Term Note bears
    interest at LIBOR plus 0.8% to 1.2%, depending on certain
    financial ratios and requires monthly principal payments of
    $111,000 and interest through August 2013, at which time the
    remaining principal is payable. This note is collateralized by a
    mortgage on the real estate and building, in Massachusetts,
    housing our U.S. operations. We entered into an interest
    rate swap instrument which converts the variable LIBOR rate on
    the term note to a fixed rate of 4.9%. Changes in fair

value of the swap are included in “Accumulated Other
    Comprehensive Income”. The unrealized loss on the swap will
    be recognized into income over the term of the swap as a charge
    to interest expense.

We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated
    with its U.S. Line of Credit and U.S. Long-Term Note.
    These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service
    coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio.
    The debt service coverage covenant requires us to maintain a
    trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is
    greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required
    principal and interest payments during the period. Cash flow is
    defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. For
    trailing twelve month periods until June 2010, up to
    $15.0 million of our capital expenditures are treated as
    being funded from the proceeds of our initial public offering.
    The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all
    indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis shall be
    less than two times our trailing twelve months EBITDA.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

In November 2006, we were sued for patent infringement relating
    to fiber laser and amplifier products we produce. The plaintiff
    has made a complaint for damages of over $10 million,
    treble damages for alleged willful infringement and injunctive
    relief. The case is in the discovery stage.

In February 2008, we were sued for patent infringement relating
    to two product lines allegedly used in medical laser
    applications. The plaintiff has filed a complaint for
    unspecified damages, treble damages for alleged willful
    infringement and injunctive relief. The patent asserted in the
    lawsuit expired in April 2007. The case was stayed until October
    2009 in connection with pending patent re-examinations and a
    request to extend the stay until 2010 is pending with the court.

We believe it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously
    contest these claims. No loss is deemed probable at
    December 31, 2009 and no amounts have been accrued in
    respect to these contingencies.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan covering all of its
    U.S. and German employees. We make matching contributions
    equal to 50% of the employee’s contributions, subject to a
    maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. Compensation expense
    related to our contribution to the plan for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximated $463,000,
    $504,000 and $405,000, respectively.

We have offered an employee stock purchase plan covering our
    U.S. and German employees. The plan allows employees who
    participate to purchase shares of common stock through payroll
    deductions at a 15% discount to the lower of the stock price on
    the first day or the last day of the six-month purchase period.
    Payroll deductions may not exceed 10% of the employee’s
    compensation. Compensation expense related to the employee stock
    purchase plan approximated $205,000 and $67,000 for the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In 2007, the provision for income taxes was affected by a change
    in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result
    of a reduction in enacted tax rates in Germany. Additionally,
    there was a change in certain U.S. deferred tax assets and
    liabilities as a result of a change in estimated state tax rates
    and a change in valuation allowance due to the utilization of
    state tax loss carry-forwards. In 2008, the provision for income
    taxes was affected by a change in valuation of deferred tax
    assets and liabilities as a result of a reduction in enacted tax
    rates in Russia as well as a release of valuation allowance due
    to the utilization of the remaining state tax loss
    carry-forwards.

In general, it is the practice and intention of us to reinvest
    the earnings of its

non-U.S. subsidiaries

in those operations. Accordingly, we have not made any provision
    for additional U.S. or foreign withholding taxes in respect
    to repatriation of earnings of non-US subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities shown above does not include
    certain deferred tax assets from tax deductions related to
    equity compensation in excess of equity compensation recognized
    for financial reporting. As of December 31, 2009, we have
    U.S. federal and state tax net operating loss and other
    credit carryforwards available for future periods of
    approximately $11,002,000 and $2,187,000, respectively. The
    federal and state tax net operating loss and other credit
    carryforwards begin expiring in 2022 and 2010, respectively. All
    of the federal and state net operating loss and other credit
    carryforwards will be credited to paid in capital when realized
    and, accordingly, no deferred tax assets are recognized with
    respect to these carryforwards. We use tax law ordering for
    purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been
    realized.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts
    of unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):

Estimated penalties and interest related to the underpayment of
    income taxes are $206,000, $129,000 and $178,000 for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
    are included within the provision for income taxes. Total
    accrued penalties and interest related to the underpayment of
    income taxes are $514,000, $308,000 and $179,000 for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain
    subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Open
    tax years by major jurisdictions are:

•

United
    States      2002 — 2009

•

Germany             2003 —

•

Russia                 2009

We are currently undergoing an examination by German tax
    authorities for the years 2003 to 2008. It is not expected that
    the outcome of this examination will have a material effect on
    our results of operations.
