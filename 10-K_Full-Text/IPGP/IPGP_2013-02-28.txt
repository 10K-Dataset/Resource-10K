Industry Background

Conventional Laser Technologies

Since the laser was invented over 50 years ago, laser technology has revolutionized a broad range of applications and products in various industries, including general manufacturing, automotive, medical,
research, consumer products, electronics, semiconductors and communications. Lasers provide flexible, non-contact and high-speed ways to process and treat various materials. They are widely used to transmit large volumes of data in optical
communications systems, various medical applications and test and measurement systems. They are also incorporated into manufacturing, medical and other systems by OEMs, system integrators and end users. For a wide variety of applications, lasers
provide superior performance and a more cost-effective solution than non-laser technologies.

Lasers emit an intense light
beam that can be focused on a small area, causing metals and other materials to melt, vaporize or change their character. These properties are utilized in applications requiring very high-power densities, such as marking, printing, welding, cutting,
drilling, cladding and other materials processing procedures. Lasers are well-suited for imaging and inspection applications, and the ability to confine laser light to narrow wavelengths makes them particularly effective in medical and sensing
applications. A laser works by converting electrical energy to optical energy. In a laser, an energy source excites or pumps a lasing medium, which converts the energy from the source into an emission consisting of particles of light, called
photons, at a particular wavelength.

Historically, carbon dioxide (“CO


”) gas lasers and crystal lasers have been the two principal laser
types used in materials processing and many other applications. They are named for the materials used to create the lasing action. A CO


laser produces light by electrically stimulating a gas-filled tube and delivers the beam through free space using mirrors
to provide direction. A crystal laser uses an arc lamp, pulsed flash lamp or diode stack or array to optically pump a special crystal. The most common crystal lasers use yttrium aluminum garnet (“YAG”) crystals infused with neodymium or
ytterbium. Some crystal lasers also use mirrors in free space to deliver the beam or direct the beam through fiber optics.

Introduction of Fiber Lasers

Fiber lasers use semiconductor diodes as the light source to pump specialty optical fibers, which are infused with rare earth ions. These fibers are called active fibers and are comparable in diameter to
a human hair. The laser emission is created within optical fibers and delivered through a flexible optical fiber cable. As a result of their different design and components, fiber lasers are more reliable, efficient, robust and portable, and easier
to operate than conventional lasers. In addition, fiber lasers free the end users from fine mechanical adjustments and the high maintenance costs that are typical for conventional lasers.

Although low-power fiber lasers have existed for approximately four decades, their increased recent adoption has been driven primarily by
our improvements in their output power levels and cost as well as their superior performance compared with conventional lasers. We have successfully increased output power levels by developing improved optical components such as active fibers that
have increased their power capacities and improved their performance. Fiber lasers now offer output powers that exceed those of conventional lasers in many categories. Also, semiconductor diodes historically have represented the majority of the cost
of fiber lasers. The high cost of diodes meant that fiber lasers could not compete with conventional lasers on price and limited their use to high value-added applications. Over the last several years, however, our semiconductor diodes have become
more affordable and reliable due, in part, to substantial advancements in semiconductor diode technology and increased production volumes. As a result, the average cost per watt of output power has decreased dramatically over the last decade.
Because of these improvements, our fiber lasers can now effectively



compete with conventional lasers over a wide range of output powers and applications. As a pioneer in the development and commercialization of fiber lasers, we have contributed to many
advancements in fiber laser technology and products.

Advantages of Fiber Lasers over Conventional Lasers

We believe that fiber lasers provide a combination of benefits that include:

•

Superior Performance.

Fiber lasers provide high beam quality over the entire power range. In most conventional laser
solutions, the beam quality is sensitive to output power, while in fiber lasers, the output beam is virtually non-divergent over a wide power range. A non-divergent beam enables higher levels of precision, increased power densities and the ability
to deliver the beam over greater distances to where processing can be completed. The superior beam quality and greater intensity of a fiber laser’s beam allow tasks to be accomplished more rapidly, with lower-power units and with greater
flexibility than comparable conventional lasers.

•

Lower Cost.

The purchase price for fiber lasers is generally lower than that of YAG lasers and of many conventional
CO


lasers. Fiber lasers are cheaper to operate due to their
lower energy usage, lower required maintenance costs and better processing speeds. Fiber lasers convert electrical energy to optical energy approximately 2 to 3 times more efficiently than diode-pumped YAG lasers, approximately 3 times more
efficiently than conventional CO


lasers and approximately 15
to 30 times more efficiently than lamp-pumped YAG lasers. Because fiber lasers are much more energy-efficient and place lower levels of thermal stress on their internal components, they have substantially lower cooling requirements compared to those
of conventional lasers, which also improves overall energy efficiency. Fiber lasers have lower to no maintenance costs due to the high performance and long life of our single-emitter diodes, fiber optics and other optical components, which can be
used for up to 100,000 hours without replacement. The higher power density of the fiber laser beam also allows for higher processing speeds in many applications, which increases the operating efficiencies on a per-part basis.

•

Ease of Use.

Many features of fiber lasers make them easier to operate, maintain and integrate into laser-based systems
as compared to conventional lasers. There are no moving parts in the fiber laser so they do not require adjustments of internal components.

•

Compact Size and Portability.

Fiber lasers are typically smaller and lighter in weight than conventional lasers, saving
valuable floor space. While conventional lasers are delicate due to the precise alignment of mirrors, fiber lasers are more durable and able to perform in variable environments.

•

Choice of Wavelengths and Precise Control of Beam.

The design of fiber lasers generally provides a broad range of
wavelength choices, allowing users to select the precise wavelength that best matches their application and materials. Because the beam is delivered through fiber optics, it can be directed to the work area over longer distances without loss of beam
quality.

Fiber amplifiers are similar in design to fiber lasers, use many of the same components, such as
semiconductor diodes and specialty optical fibers, and provide many of the same advantages in the applications that require amplification.

Notwithstanding the benefits offered by fiber lasers, there remain applications and processes where conventional laser technologies may provide superior performance with respect to particular features.
For example, crystal lasers can provide higher peak power pulses and fiber lasers do not generate the deep ultra-violet light that is used for photolithography in many semiconductor applications. In addition, CO


lasers operate at wavelengths that are optimal for use on many
non-metallic materials, including plastics.



Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that our key competitive strengths position us to take advantage of opportunities to displace traditional lasers and enable use of fiber lasers in new applications. Our key strengths and
competitive advantages include:

World’s Leading Producer of Fiber Laser Technology.

We are
the world’s largest manufacturer of fiber lasers. As a pioneer and technology leader in fiber lasers, we have built leading positions in our various end markets with a large and diverse customer base. Based on our leadership positions, we are
able to leverage our scale to reduce costs for our customers and drive the proliferation of fiber lasers in existing and new applications. We rely on several key proprietary technologies, including pumping technology, manufacturing of fiber to
withstand the high output power of our lasers, gain blocks and optics that contribute to the superior performance and reliability of our products.

Vertically Integrated Development and Manufacturing.

We develop and manufacture all of our key high-volume specialty components, including semiconductor diodes, active
fibers, passive fibers and specialty optical components. We believe that our vertical integration and our high-volume production enhances our ability to meet customer requirements, reduce costs, accelerate and focus development, shorten lead times,
limit the spread of trade secrets and provide competitive pricing advantages to us while maintaining high performance and quality standards.

Breadth and Depth of Expertise.

We have extensive know-how in materials sciences, which enables us to make our specialty optical fibers, semiconductor diodes and other
critical components. We also have experience in optical, electrical, mechanical and semiconductor engineering, which we use to develop and manufacture our proprietary components, products and systems.



Diverse Customer Base, End Markets and Applications.

Our
diverse customer base, end markets and applications provide us with many growth opportunities. In 2012, we shipped more than 25,000 units to over 1,900 customers worldwide, with no single customer representing more than 7% of our sales. Our products
are used in a wide variety of applications and end markets worldwide. Our principal end markets and representative applications within those markets include:



Broad Product Portfolio and Ability to Meet Customer
Requirements.

We offer a broad range of standard and custom fiber lasers and amplifiers, enabling deployment in a wide variety of applications and end markets. Our vertically integrated manufacturing and broad technology
expertise enable us to design, prototype and commence high-volume production of our products rapidly, allowing our customers to meet their time-to-market requirements.

Our Strategy

Our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership
position by pursuing the following key elements of our strategy:

Leverage Our Technology to Increase
Sales.

As fiber lasers become more widely accepted, we plan to leverage our position as the leader in fiber lasers and our applications expertise to develop solutions for customers and increase our position in the broader
laser market. We believe that our fiber lasers will continue to displace traditional lasers in many existing applications due to their superior performance and value. Over the last decade, our pulsed fiber lasers have become widely accepted in laser
metal marking applications and now have a leading position in those applications. More recently, our high-power continuous wave (“CW”) fiber lasers have been accepted by a growing number of laser cutting system OEMs for two- and
three-dimension cutting, one of the largest laser materials processing applications. We plan to continue to leverage our fiber laser technology by pursuing large-scale laser applications where our fiber lasers offer improved customer value and
performance. Some of the more significant applications we intend to target include: (i) welding of thick steel with our high-power lasers; (ii) micro-processing with our quasi-CW (“QCW”) fiber lasers; (iii) processing of
non-metals, such as plastics, with our new high-power thulium lasers; and (iv) fine-processing, scribing and marking with our high-power green lasers and new ultra-violet (“UV”), lasers now under development.

Target New Applications for Lasers and Expand into Broader Markets.

We intend to expand the
use of fiber lasers into additional applications where faster or higher quality processing, higher power, portability, efficiency, size and flexible fiber cable delivery can lead customers to adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. We
believe that the advantages of fiber laser technology can overcome many of the limitations that have hindered the adoption of conventional lasers in broader industrial markets and processes. Using our manufacturing scale and technology innovations,
we have been successful in reducing the cost of manufacturing with lasers, making fiber lasers a more attractive manufacturing alternative. We target applications where higher power, portability, efficiency, size and flexible fiber cable delivery
can lead customers to adopt fiber lasers instead of non-laser solutions. Certain industry trends such as the use of high-strength steel in automotive manufacturing and decreasing the weight of vehicles are driving the use of fiber lasers over other
manufacturing methods such as stamping, non-laser welding and adhesives. Other trends, such as miniaturization of parts and electronics, contribute to the use of lasers because no other tools can work as precisely. We are working on developing new
applications for fiber lasers through internal research and in partnership with customers and industrial institutes.

Expand Our Product Portfolio.

We plan to continue to invest in research and development to add additional wavelengths, power levels and other parameters while also improving
beam quality, as well as developing new product lines and laser-based systems. Using our core technologies and breadth of experience, we plan to expand the wavelengths at which our lasers operate. This includes UV lasers that can be used for
fine-processing applications and mid-infrared lasers that can be used for medical applications, non-metal materials processing and other novel applications. We have increased the output power of our green lasers for use in the semiconductor market.
We will continue to expand sales of specialized laser-based systems to meet the specific needs of manufacturing end users whose requirements are not met by standard systems or in certain geographic areas where fiber laser systems are not currently
available. In 2012, we acquired a business that develops and produces industrial grade UV excimer, solid state and pico-second laser micromachining systems. We also expanded our capabilities to manufacture high-power laser systems for certain
applications and markets and developed a high-power scanning system for multiple materials processing applications.



Lower Our Costs Through Manufacturing Improvements and
Innovation.

We plan to seek further improvements in component manufacturing processes and device assembly as well as innovation in components and device designs to improve performance and decrease the overall cost per watt
for our products. As we increase our volumes, we are better able to negotiate price reductions with certain of our suppliers. We intend to leverage our technology and operations expertise to manufacture additional components in order to reduce
costs, ensure component quality and ensure supply. In 2012, we machined more of our mechanical parts, manufactured more of the printed circuit boards we use, and redesigned certain optical components to improve quality and decrease costs. We also
further decreased the cost of our packaged diodes. In addition, we manufactured additional components that we had previously outsourced, such as mechanical cabinets, printed circuit boards and optical sub-assemblies. By reducing the cost per watt of
our lasers and maintaining the lower operating cost of our products, we believe that we can increase laser use in applications in which conventional lasers could not be used economically.

Expand Global Reach to Attract Customers Worldwide.

Our customers’ manufacturing
operations have expanded in emerging markets and are moving to lower-cost international locations. We have increased and will continue to increase our international sales and service locations to respond to our customers’ needs. In 2012, we
opened a new sales and service office in Turkey. We are considering increasing our presence in additional countries with large manufacturing infrastructures.

Products

We design and manufacture a broad range of high-performance
optical fiber-based lasers and amplifiers. We also make packaged diodes, direct diode lasers, laser systems, communications systems and materials processing laser systems that utilize our optical fiber-based products as well as other laser sources.
Many of our products are designed to be used as general-purpose energy or light sources, making them useful in diverse applications and markets.

Our products are based on a common proprietary technology platform using many of the same core components, such as semiconductor diodes and specialty fibers, which we configure to our customers’
specifications. Our engineers and scientists work closely with OEMs, system integrators and end users to develop and customize our products for their needs. Because of our flexible and modular product architecture, we offer products in different
configurations according to the desired application, including modules, rack-mounted units and tabletop units. Our engineers and other technical experts work directly with the customer in our application and development centers to develop and
configure the optimal solution for each customer’s manufacturing requirements. We also manufacture certain complementary products that are used with our lasers, such as optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical heads and
chillers.

Lasers

pulsed. We offer several different types of lasers, which are defined by the type of gain medium they use. These are ytterbium, erbium, thulium and Raman. We also sell fiber pigtailed packaged diodes and fiber coupled direct diode laser systems that
use semiconductor diodes rather than optical fibers as their gain medium. In addition, we offer high-energy pulsed lasers, multi-wavelength lasers, tunable lasers, single-polarization and single-frequency lasers, as well as other versions of our
products.

We believe that we produce the highest-power solid-state lasers in the industry. Our ytterbium fiber lasers reach
power levels of up to 100,000 watts. We also make single-mode and low-mode output ytterbium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 20,000 watts and single-mode, low-output erbium and thulium fiber lasers with power levels of up to 400 watts. Our
compact, durable design and integrated fiber optic beam delivery allow us to offer versatile laser energy sources and simple laser integration for complex production processes without compromising quality, speed or power.



We also sell laser diode chips and packaged laser diodes operating at 9XX nanometers. We
sell our own family of high-power optical fiber delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, chillers and other accessories for our fiber lasers. Recently, we introduced a high-power scanner for use with our fiber lasers.

IPG offers a retrofit service to replace CO


and lamp-pumped YAG laser sources with fiber lasers in many welding, cutting, drilling and other systems, allowing
customers to retain their existing laser systems. IPG also makes active and passive laser materials and tunable lasers in the middle-infrared region.

Amplifiers

Our amplifier products range from milliwatts to up to
1,500 watts of output power from 1 to 2 microns in wavelength. We offer erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (“EDFAs”), Raman amplifiers and integrated communications systems that incorporate our amplifiers. These products are predominantly
deployed in broadband networks such as fiber to the home (“FTTH”), fiber to the curb (“FTTC”), and passive optical networks (“PON”), and dense wavelength division multiplexing (“DWDM”), networks. We also offer
ytterbium and thulium specialty fiber amplifiers and broadband light sources that are used in advanced applications. In addition, we sell single-frequency, linearly polarized and polarization-maintaining versions of our amplifier products. As with
our fiber lasers, our fiber amplifiers offer some of the highest output power levels and highest number of optical outputs in the industry. We believe our line of fiber amplifiers offers the best commercially available output power and performance.

Systems

Besides selling laser sources, we also offer integrated laser systems for particular geographic markets or custom-developed for a customer’s manufacturing requirements. Through our IPG Microsystems
business, we offer industrial grade UV excimer, diode pumped solid state and pico-second laser micromachining systems and materials processing services. Key applications for these systems include advanced laser scribing and lift-off
(“LLO”) of light-emitting diodes (“LEDs”), thin film solar scribing, semiconductor, micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”), research, biomedical and industrial micromachining. IPG Microsystems’ laser systems
operate at wavelengths from 157nm to 1,064nm, and are essential to a growing set of today’s industrial micromachining applications.

IPG also develops and sells specialized fiber laser systems for unique material processing applications as requested by customers desiring a complete laser-based solution, including remote welding,
micro-welding and cutting. The platforms include multi-axis workstations for welding, flatbed cutters, and diode markers. Other systems offerings include a welding seam stepper and picker, which is an automated and integrated fiber laser welding
tool providing customers increased processing speeds, better quality and the elimination of certain clamping tools. The seam stepper and picker, an alternative to resistance welding, are used in automotive assembly, sheet metal production and other
materials processing applications.



The following table lists our principal product lines that generated a substantial majority
of our revenues in 2012, and the principal applications markets in which they are used:

Our products are used in a broad range of applications. The major application is materials processing,
comprising approximately 88% of our sales in 2012. Our products also address other applications, including advanced applications (approximately 7% of sales), communications (approximately 4% of sales) and medical (approximately 1% of sales).

Our Markets

Materials Processing

The most significant materials processing applications for fiber lasers are cutting and welding and marking and engraving. Other applications include micro-processing, surface treatment, drilling,
soldering, annealing, hardening, rapid prototyping and laser-assisted machining.

Cutting and Welding
Applications.

Laser-based cutting technology has several advantages compared to alternative technologies. Laser cutting is fast, flexible and highly precise and can be used to cut complex contours on flat, tubular or
three-dimensional materials. The laser source can be programmed to process many



different kinds of materials such as steel, aluminum, brass, copper, glass, ceramic and plastic at various thicknesses. Laser cutting technology is a non-contact process that is easy to integrate
into an automated production line and is not subject to wear of the cutting medium. We sell low, mid and high-power ytterbium fiber lasers for laser cutting. High electrical efficiency, low maintenance and operating cost, high beam quality, wide
operating power range, power stability and small spot size are some of the qualities offered by IPG fiber lasers for many cutting applications, which enable customers to cut a variety of materials faster.

Laser welding offers several important advantages compared to conventional welding technology as it is non-contact, easy to automate,
provides high process speed and results in narrow-seamed, high-quality welds that generally require little or no post-processing machining. The high beam quality of our fiber lasers coupled with high CW power offer deep penetration welding as well
as shallow conduction mode welding. In addition, fiber lasers can be focused to a small spot with extremely long focal lengths, enabling remote welding “on the fly,” a flexible method of three-dimensional welding in which the laser beam is
positioned by a robot-guided scanner. Such remote welding stations equipped with fiber lasers are used for welding door panels and seat backs, the multiple welding of spot and lap welds over the entire auto body frame and welding
“body-in-white,” which is welding pieces of metal with different thicknesses for automotive applications. Typically, mid to high-power ytterbium fiber lasers and long-pulse QCW ytterbium fiber lasers are used in welding applications. Our
products are used also for laser brazing of visible joints in automobiles such as tailgates, roof joints and columns. Brazing is a method of connecting sheet metal.

Marking and Engraving.

With the increasing need for source traceability, component identification and product tracking as a means of reducing product liability and preventing
falsification, as well as the demand for modern robotic production systems, manufacturers increasingly demand marking systems capable of applying serialized alphanumeric, graphic or bar code identifications directly onto their manufactured
components. Laser engraving is similar to marking but forms deeper grooves in the material. In contrast to conventional acid etching and ink-based technologies, lasers can mark a wide variety of metal and non-metal materials, such as ceramic, glass
and plastic surfaces, at high speeds and without contact by changing the surface structure of the material or by engraving. Laser marking systems can be easily integrated into a customer’s production process and do not subject the item being
marked to mechanical stress. Our ytterbium pulsed fiber lasers are used for these applications.

In the semiconductor
industry, lasers typically are used to mark wafers and integrated circuits. In the electronics industry, lasers typically are used to mark electrical components such as contactors, relays and printed circuit boards. Consumer electronic devices such
as mobile phones, computers and handheld computers contain many parts that are laser-marked, including keyboards, logos and labels. With the increase in marking speed in the past few years, the cost of laser marking has decreased. In the
photovoltaic or solar panel industry, pulsed lasers increasingly are used to remove materials and to scribe, or cut, solar cells. The high beam quality, increased peak output powers, flexible fiber delivery and competitive price of fiber lasers have
accelerated the adoption of fiber lasers in these low-power applications.

Micro-Processing and Non-Metal
Processing.

The trend toward miniaturization in numerous industries such as consumer electronics, as well as innovations in materials and structures, is driving end users to utilize lasers in processing and fabrication.
The ability of lasers to cut, weld, drill, ablate, etch and add materials on a fine scale is enabling new technologies and products across many industries. Our low-power CW and QCW lasers are used to cut medical stents and weld medical batteries. In
photovoltaic manufacturing, our lasers etch and perform edge isolation processes. The aerospace industry requires precise manufacturing of engine parts so that cooling is effective and aerospace manufacturers use lasers to conduct percussive
drilling. Processing of plastics and semi-conductors require short pulse and high energy lasers, in the green, UV and mid infra-red wavelengths.

Advanced Applications

Our fiber lasers and amplifiers are utilized
by commercial firms and by academic and government institutions worldwide for manufacturing of commercial systems and for research in advanced technologies and products. These markets may use specialty products developed by us or commercial versions
of our products.



Obstacle Warning and Mapping.

Our products are used for
obstacle warning and 3-dimensional mapping of earth surfaces.

Special Projects.

Due to the high
power, compactness, performance, portability, ruggedness and electrical efficiency of our fiber lasers and amplifiers, we sell our commercial products for government research and projects. These include materials testing, ordnance destruction,
coherent beam combining, directed energy demonstrations, advanced communications and research.

Research and
Development.

Our products are used in a variety of applications for research and development by scientists and industrial researchers, including atom trapping. In addition, our lasers and amplifiers are used to design,
test and characterize components and systems in a variety of markets and applications.

Optical Pumping and Harmonic
Generation.

Several types of our lasers are used to optically pump other solid-state lasers and for harmonic generation and parametric converters to support research in sensing, medical and other scientific research in the
infrared and visible wavelength domains. Our lasers are used as a power source for these other lasers. Green visible lasers are used to pump titanium sapphire lasers. Visible lasers can be used in optical displays, planetariums and light shows.

Remote Sensing.

Our products are used in light detection and ranging (“LIDAR”), a
laser technique for remote sensing. Optical fiber can be used as a sensor for measuring changes in temperature, pressure and gas concentration in oil wells, atmospheric and pollution measurements and seismic exploration.

Communications

We design and manufacture a DWDM transport system with varying output power and wavelengths and a full range of fiber amplifiers and Raman pump lasers that enhance data transmission in broadband access
and DWDM optical networks. We are leveraging our high-power diode and fiber technology through the qualification and sale of high-value integrated solutions for network suppliers.

DWDM

.    DWDM is a technology that expands the capacity of optical networks, allowing service providers to
extend the life of existing fiber networks and reduce operating and capital costs by maximizing bandwidth capacity. We provide a broad range of high-power products for DWDM applications including EDFAs and Raman lasers. We provide a DWDM transport
system that offers service providers and private network operators a simple, flexible, optical layer solution scalable to 80 channels that aggregates and multiplexes multiprotocol clients into optical transport network signals operating at 10, 40
and 100 gigabits per second per channel.

Broadband Access.

The delivery to subscribers of
television programming and Internet-based information and communication services is converging, driven by advances in Internet Protocol (“IP”) technology and by changes in the regulatory and competitive environment. Fiber optic lines now
offer connection speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second to the subscriber, or 1,000 times faster than digital subscriber lines (“DSL”), or cable links. We offer a series of specialty multi-port EDFAs and cable television
(“TV”) nodes and transmitters that support different types of passive optical network architectures, enabling high-speed data, voice, video on demand and high-definition TV. We provide an EDFA that supports up to 64 output ports, which
allows service providers to support a high number of customers in a small space, reducing overall power consumption and network cost. End users for our products include communications network operators for video wavelength division multiplexing
overlay solutions, operators of metro and long-haul networks for DWDM and amplification solutions, as well as cable and multiple system operators for optical amplification solutions.

Medical

We sell our commercial fiber and diode lasers to OEMs that incorporate our products into their medical laser systems. CW erbium and thulium fiber lasers from 1 to 150 watts and diode laser systems can be
used in



various medical and biomedical applications. Aesthetic applications addressed by lasers include skin rejuvenation, skin resurfacing and stretch mark removal. Purchasers use our diode lasers in
dental and skin tightening procedures. Surgical applications include prostate surgery. Fiber lasers have the ability to fine-tune optical penetration depth and absorption characteristics and can be used for ear, nose and throat, urology, gynecology
and other surgical procedures.

Technology

Our products are based on our proprietary technology platform that we have developed and refined since our formation. The following technologies are key elements in our products.

Specialty Optical Fibers

We have extensive expertise in the disciplines and techniques that form the basis for the multi-clad active and passive optical fibers used in our products. Active optical fibers form the laser cavity or
gain medium in which lasing or amplification of light occurs in our products. Passive optical fibers deliver the optical energy created in our products. Our active fibers consist of an inner core that is infused with the appropriate rare earth ion,
such as ytterbium, erbium or thulium, and outer cores of un-doped glass having different indices of refraction. We believe that our large portfolio of specialty active and passive optical fibers has a number of advantages as compared to other
commercially available optical fibers. These advantages include higher concentrations of rare earth ions, fibers that will not degrade at the high power levels over the useful life of the product, high lasing efficiency, ability to achieve
single-mode outputs at high powers, ability to withstand high optical energies and temperatures and scalable side-pumping capability.

Semiconductor Diode Laser Processing and Packaging Technologies

Another key element of our technology platform is that we use multiple multi-mode, or broad area, single-emitter diodes rather than diode
bars or stacks as a pump source. We believe that multi-mode single-emitter diodes are the most efficient and reliable pumping source presently available, surpassing diode bars and stacks in efficiency, brightness and reliability. Single-emitter
diodes have substantially reduced cooling requirements and typically have estimated lifetimes of more than 100,000 hours at high operating currents, compared to typical lifetimes of up to 10,000 to 20,000 hours for diode bars.

We developed advanced molecular beam epitaxy techniques to grow alumina indium gallium arsenide wafers for our diodes. This method yields
high-quality optoelectronic material for low-defect density and high uniformity of optoelectronic parameters. In addition, we have developed numerous proprietary wafer processes and testing and qualification procedures in order to create a high
energy output in a reliable and high-power diode. We package our diodes in hermetically sealed pump modules in which the diodes are combined with an optical fiber output. Characteristics such as the ability of the package to dissipate heat produced
by the diode and withstand vibration, shock, high temperature, humidity and other environmental conditions are critical to the reliability and efficiency of the products.

Specialty Components and Combining Techniques

We developed a wide
range of advanced optical components that are capable of handling high optical power levels and contribute to the superior performance, efficiency and reliability of our products. In addition to fibers and diodes, our optical component portfolio
includes fiber gratings, couplers, isolators and combiners. We also developed special methods and expertise in splicing fibers together with low optical energy loss and on-line loss testing. We believe that our internal development and manufacturing
of key optical components allows us to lower our manufacturing costs and improve product performance.

Side Pumping of
Fibers and Fiber Block Technologies

Our technology platform allows us to efficiently combine a large number of
multi-mode single-emitter semiconductor diodes with our active optical fibers that are used in all of our products. A key element of this



technology is that we pump our fiber lasers through the cladding surrounding the active core. We splice our specialty active optical fibers with other optical components and package them in a
sealed box, which we call a fiber block. The fiber blocks are compact and eliminate the risk of contamination or misalignment due to mechanical vibrations and shocks as well as temperature or humidity variations. Our design is scalable and modular,
permitting us to make products with high output power by coupling a large number of diodes with fiber blocks, which can be combined in parallel and serially.

High-Stress Testing

We employ high-stress techniques in testing
components and final products that help increase reliability and accelerate product development. For example, we test all of our diodes with high current and temperatures to accelerate aging. We also have built a large database of diode test results
that allows us to predict the estimated lifetime of our diodes. This testing allows us to eliminate defective diodes prior to further assembly and thus increase reliability.

Customers

We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and
end users in a wide range of diverse markets who have the in-house engineering capability to integrate our products into their own systems. We have thousands of customers worldwide. Our primary end market is materials processing, comprised of
general manufacturing, automotive, heavy industry, aerospace, consumer products, medical device manufacturing, natural resources, photovoltaic semiconductor and electronics customers. We also sell our products to other end markets, including
advanced applications (comprised of commercial companies, universities, research entities and government entities), communications (comprised of system integrators, utilities and municipalities) and medical (comprised of medical laser systems
manufacturers and researchers). We believe that our customer and end-market diversification minimizes dependence on any single industry or group of customers.

The following table shows the allocation of our net sales (in thousands) among our principal markets:

None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our net sales for the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 or 2010.

Our net sales (in thousands) were derived from customers in the following geographic regions:

(1)

The substantial majority of sales in North America are to customers in the United States.



Backlog

At December 31, 2012, our backlog of orders (generally scheduled for shipment within one year) was approximately $203.0 million compared to $207.0 million at December 31, 2011. At
December 31, 2012, our backlog included $102.0 million of orders with firm shipment dates and $101.0 million of frame agreements that we expect to ship within one year, compared to $124.1 million of orders with firm shipment dates and $82.9
million of frame agreements at December 31, 2011. Frame agreements generally are agreements without committed shipment dates. Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable without substantial penalties. Historically, the rate of
cancellation experienced by us has not been significant. We manage the risk of cancellation by establishing the right to charge a cancellation fee that generally covers a portion of the purchase price, any materials and development costs incurred
prior to the order being cancelled. Our ability to enforce this right depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the customer’s requested length of delay, the number of other outstanding orders with the customer and our ability to
quickly convert the cancelled order to another sale.

We anticipate shipping a substantial majority of the present backlog
during fiscal year 2013. However, our backlog at any given date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period.

Sales, Marketing and Support

We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force sells to end users, OEMs and systems integrators. Once our fiber laser products are designed into an
OEM system, the OEM’s sales force markets its systems, allowing us to take advantage of numerous OEMs sales forces, each typically having several sales persons in locations other than where our sales offices are located. We have sales offices
in the United States, Germany, Italy, Turkey, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, India and Russia. We have materials processing application centers in the United States, Germany, Russia, China, Italy, Japan and
South Korea, which we use to demonstrate our products and develop new applications. Our application centers are fundamental to developing new laser applications for customers and assisting them in integrating lasers into their production processes.

To a lesser extent, we market through agreements with independent sales representatives and distributors. Sales to foreign
customers are generally priced in local currencies and are therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations.

We maintain a
customer support and field service staff in our major markets. We work closely with customers and independent representatives to service equipment and to train customers to use our products. We have expanded our support and field service,
particularly in locations where customer concentration or volume requires local service capabilities. We repair products at our facilities or at customer sites.

We typically provide one to three-year parts and service warranties on our lasers and amplifiers. Most of our sales offices provide support to customers in their respective geographic areas. Warranty
reserves have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs.

Manufacturing

Vertical integration is one of our core business strategies through which we control our proprietary processes and technologies as well as
the supply of key components and assemblies. We believe that our vertically integrated business model gives us the following advantages:

•

maintaining a technological lead over competitors;

•

reducing component and final product costs compared to market prices available to competitors;

•

ensuring access to critical components, enabling us to better meet customer demands;



•

controlling performance, quality and consistency; and

•

enabling rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies.

Our vertically integrated manufacturing operations include optical preform making, specialty fiber drawing, semiconductor wafer growth,
diode processing and packaging, specialty optical component manufacturing, fiber block and fiber module assembly for different power units, software and electronics development, final assembly, as well as testing, tool manufacturing and automated
production systems. Over the last several years, we added additional production capabilities, including three multi-wafer growth reactors, diode test stations, fiber pre-form and fiber drawing equipment and low, mid and high-power production and
testing, in order to increase our capacity as well as reduce the risks associated with our production process.

We operate our
own semiconductor foundry for the production of the multi-mode single-emitter diodes. Diodes are the pumps that are used as the light source in each device we make. We also process, package and extensively test all of our diodes. Because pump diodes
represent a significant component cost of the final laser or amplifier, we have chosen to develop internal manufacturing capabilities for diodes. As a result of our high-volume production levels of pump diodes, proprietary processes and use of
limited chip designs, we have been able to increase yields, lower component costs and assure high quality. We also design, manufacture and optimize many of our own test instruments, diode test racks, robotic and automated assembly tools and
machines.

We developed these proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques over many years in an
effort to address the major issues that had been inhibiting the development of fiber laser technology and to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors. We believe that the proprietary components, manufacturing tools, equipment,
techniques and software utilized in all of our product lines provide extensive barriers to potential competitors. Generally, we do not sell our proprietary components to third parties in material quantities. Using our technology platform, we
configure standard products based upon each customer’s specifications. Through our vertically integrated manufacturing operations, we can develop, test and produce new products and configurations with higher performance and reliability and in
less time than by working with external vendors. We have developed proprietary testing methodologies that allow us to develop higher power components and products in short periods of time, enable us to introduce products to the market more quickly,
capitalize on new opportunities and provide superior service to our customers.

Our in-house manufacturing generally includes
only those operations and components that are critical to the protection of our intellectual property, the reduction of our costs or the achievement of performance and quality standards. We purchase from vendors common and specialized mechanical,
electrical and optical parts and raw materials, such as printed circuit boards, wafer substrates and various optical components.

Research
and Development

We have extensive research and development experience in laser materials, fiber and optoelectronic
components. We have assembled a team of scientists and engineers with specialized experience and extensive knowledge in fiber lasers and amplifiers, critical components, testing and manufacturing process design.

We focus our research and development efforts on designing and introducing new and improved standard and customized products and the mass
production of components for our products. In addition to our cladding-pumped specialty fiber platform, we have core competencies in high-power multi-mode semiconductor laser diodes, diode packaging, specialty active and passive optical fibers,
high-performance optical components, fiber gain blocks and fiber modules, as well as splicing and combining techniques and high-stress test methods. Our research and development efforts are aided by our vertical integration and our proprietary
high-stress testing techniques that result in accelerated development cycles. The strategy of developing our proprietary components has allowed us to leverage our optical experience and large volume requirements to lower the cost of our products. We
concentrate our research and development efforts on advancements in performance as well as capacity to hold and produce higher optical power levels.



Our research and development efforts are also directed at expanding our product line by
increasing power levels, improving beam quality and electrical efficiency, decreasing the size of our products and lowering the cost per watt. We also are engaged in research projects to expand the spectral range of products that we offer, including
the development of UV pulsed fiber lasers, ultra-fast pulsed fiber lasers, and a mid-infrared (“IR”) line of lasers from 2 to 5 microns, with a hybrid fiber and crystal laser design. Our team of experienced scientists and engineers works
closely with many of our customers to develop and introduce custom products that address specific applications and performance requirements.

We incurred research and development costs of approximately $31.4 million, $25.4 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We plan to continue our
commitment to research and development and to introduce new products, systems and complementary products that would allow us to maintain our competitive position. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition of Results of Operations.”

Intellectual Property

We seek to protect our proprietary technology primarily through the U.S. and foreign laws affording protection for trade secrets, and to
seek U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and trademark protection of our products and processes where appropriate. Historically, we relied primarily on trade secrets, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information relating to our
product development and manufacturing activities. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by requiring our employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment to
us of rights to inventions that they make while we employ them. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our consultants and suppliers to protect confidential information delivered to them. We believe that our vertical integration,
including our long experience in making a wide range of specialty and high-power capacity components, as well as our technology platform make it difficult for others to reverse engineer our products.

We have increased our efforts to expand our patent portfolio globally. As of February 28, 2013, we have over 140 patents issued and
over 180 pending patent applications worldwide relating principally to optical fiber lasers, amplifiers, bulk optics, semiconductors, and laser and telecommunications systems. With respect to the United States, we were issued 18 patents and we filed
23 applications on new subject matter in 2012. In February 2008, we purchased a portfolio of photonics patents from British Telecommunications plc in the fields of optical fiber lasers and amplifiers, semiconductor devices, integrated optics, fiber
gratings, high-speed systems and optical networking. Intellectual property rights, including those that we own, those that we license and those of others, involve significant risks. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Our Inability to Protect Our
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technologies Could Result in the Unauthorized Use of Our Technologies by Third Parties, Hurt Our Competitive Position and Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”

Competition

Our markets
are competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuously evolving customer requirements. We believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are:

•

product performance and reliability;

•

quality and service support;

•

price and value to the customer;

•

ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis;

•

ability to achieve qualification for and integration into OEM systems;

•

ability to meet customer specifications; and

•

ability to respond quickly to market demand and technological developments.



We believe we compete favorably with respect to these criteria. In the
materials processing market, the competition is fragmented and includes a large number of competitors. We compete with makers of high-power CO

2,

YAG and disc lasers, including Fanuc, Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc. and Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, makers of mid and
low-power CO

2,

solid-state lasers such as Coherent, Inc., GSI
Group Inc., Newport Corporation and Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., and direct diode lasers such as Laserline GmbH. We also compete with fiber laser makers, including Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc., Coherent
Inc., Hypertherm, Inc., Newport Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi Unitek Corporation, Raycus Fiber Laser Technologies Co. Ltd., Maxphotonics Co., Ltd. and JDS Uniphase Corporation.
Several competitors recently introduced fiber lasers or announced plans to introduce fiber lasers that compete with our high-power products. We believe that we compete favorably with other makers of fiber lasers on price and value to customer,
reliability, service and performance.

We also compete in the materials processing, advanced and medical applications markets
with end users that produce their own solid-state and gas lasers as well as with manufacturers of non-laser methods and tools, such as resistance welding and cutting dies in the materials processing market and scalpels in the medical market.

In the communications market, our principal competitors are manufacturers of mid-power fiber amplifiers and DWDM systems,
such as Oclaro Inc., the Scientific-Atlanta division of Cisco Systems, Inc. (Scientific-Atlanta), Emcore Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation and MPB Communications Inc. The fiber amplifier market is more established than the fiber laser market and
technological change has not occurred as rapidly as it has in the case of fiber lasers. We believe that we compete favorably with other high-power fiber amplifier producers with respect to price, product performance and output power.

Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial, managerial and technical resources, more
extensive distribution and service networks, greater sales and marketing capacity, and larger installed customer bases than we do.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2012, we had approximately 2,400 full-time employees, including 260 in research and development, 1,840 in manufacturing operations, 110 in sales, service and marketing, and 190 in general and administrative functions. Of our total
full-time employees at our principal facilities, approximately 720 were in the United States, 710 were in Germany, 670 were in Russia and 90 were in China. We have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees is subject to a
collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our current relations with our employees are good.

Government Regulation

Regulatory Compliance

The majority of our laser and amplifier products sold in the United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (“CDRH”) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The same classification system is applied in the European markets. Safety rules are formulated with “Deutsche Industrie Norm” (i.e., German Industrial
Standards) or International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standards, which are internationally harmonized.

CDRH regulations generally require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with
respect to each product incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements. The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and
other remedies for violations of their requirements. We believe that our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of laser devices.



Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including those relating to
the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental protection laws and
regulations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of
accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources
of our business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
FACTORS

The factors described below are the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition. Other factors may exist that we do not consider significant based on information that is currently available. In addition, new risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the
extent to which they may affect us.

Downturns in the markets we serve, particularly materials processing, could
have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

Our business depends substantially upon capital
expenditures by our customers, particularly by manufacturers in the materials processing market, which includes general manufacturing, automotive, marking, electronics and photovoltaic applications. Approximately 88% of our revenues in 2012 were
from customers in the materials processing market. Although applications in this market are broad, sales for these applications are cyclical and have historically experienced sudden and severe downturns and periods of oversupply, resulting in
significantly reduced demand for capital equipment, including the products that we manufacture and market. For example, our sales decreased by 25% in the materials processing market in 2009 as a result of the global economic recession. For the
foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in this market, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for their products or services. Decreased demand for products and services from customers for
these applications during an economic downturn may lead to decreased demand for our products, which would reduce our sales and margins. We may not be able to respond by decreasing our expenses quickly enough, due in part, to our fixed overhead
structure related to our vertically integrated operations and our commitments to continuing investment in research and development.

Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions of markets in which we participate negatively affect our business.

Current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of
growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the materials processing, telecommunications, advanced and medical markets
and applications in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets and applications we serve and demand for our products, the prevailing economic
uncertainties



render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Our sales have benefited in 2012, 2011 and 2010 from our increased sales of mid and high-power lasers to end users in
China. A slowing of economic growth, or a recession in China, would slow our growth rates or may result in a decrease in our sales. Adverse changes have occurred and may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional
economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, declines in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, declines in real estate values, or other factors
affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our lasers and amplifiers, increase exposure to losses from bad debts, increase the cost and decrease the availability of financing, increase the risk of loss
on investments, or increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. A prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our sales depend upon our ability to penetrate new applications for fiber lasers and increase our market share in existing
applications.

Our level of sales will depend on our ability to generate sales of fiber lasers in
applications where conventional lasers, such as CO


and YAG
lasers, have been used or in new and developing markets and applications for lasers where they have not been used previously. To date, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been derived from sales of fiber lasers primarily for applications
where CO


and YAG lasers historically have been used. In
order to maintain or increase market demand for our fiber laser products, we will need to devote substantial resources to:

•

demonstrate the effectiveness of fiber lasers in new applications;

•

increase our direct and indirect sales efforts;

•

effectively service and support our installed product base on a global basis;

•

extend our product line to address new applications for our products; and

•

continue to reduce our manufacturing costs and enhance our competitive position.

If we are unable to implement our strategy to develop new applications for our products, our revenues, operating results and financial
condition could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our business strategy. In addition, our newly developed or enhanced products may not achieve market acceptance or may be rendered obsolete or
less competitive by the introduction of new products by other companies.

If fiber lasers do not achieve broader market
acceptance or if market penetration occurs more slowly than we expect, sales and profitability may be negatively impacted.

Fiber lasers are relatively new when compared to conventional lasers and our future success depends on the development and broader acceptance of fiber lasers. Potential customers may be reluctant to adopt
fiber lasers as an alternative to conventional lasers, such as CO


and YAG, and non-laser methods, such as mechanical tools. Such potential customers may have substantial investments and know-how related to their existing laser and non-laser technologies, and may
perceive risks relating to the reliability, quality, usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fiber lasers when compared to other laser or non-laser technologies available in the market. Many of our target markets, such as the automotive, machine tool
and other manufacturing, communications and medical industries, have historically adopted new technologies slowly. These markets often require long test and qualification periods or lengthy government approval processes before adopting new
technologies. As a result, we may expend significant resources and time to qualify our products for a new customer application, and we cannot assure that our products will be qualified or approved for such markets. If acceptance of fiber laser
technology and of our fiber lasers in particular does not continue to grow within the markets that we serve, then the opportunities to maintain or increase our revenues and profitability may be severely limited.



Our vertically integrated business results in high levels of fixed costs and inventory
levels that may adversely impact our gross profits and our operating results in the event that demand for our products declines or we maintain excess inventory levels.

We have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated business model, including the fact that approximately 76% of our approximately 2,400 employees as of December 31, 2012 were employed in
our manufacturing operations. We may not adjust these fixed costs quickly enough to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross profit, in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales, is impacted by our sales volume, the
corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses and manufacturing yields. In addition, because we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and design and manufacture our key specialty components, insufficient demand for our
products may subject us to the risks of high inventory carrying costs and increased inventory obsolescence. If our capacity and production levels are not properly sized in relation to expected demand, we may need to record write-downs for excess or
obsolete inventory. Because we are vertically integrated, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change significantly in the future and believe that we will have to
maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. Changes in our level of inventory lead to an increase in cash
generated from our operations when inventory is sold or a decrease in cash generated from our operations at times when the amount of inventory increases.

Our manufacturing capacity and operations may not be appropriate for future levels of demand and may adversely affect our gross margins.

We have added and are continuing to add substantial manufacturing capacity at our facilities in the United States, Germany and Russia. A
significant portion of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment, such as our semiconductor production and processing equipment, diode packaging equipment and diode burn-in stations, are special-purpose in nature and cannot be adapted
easily to make other products. If the demand for fiber lasers or amplifiers does not increase or if our revenue decreases from current levels, we may have significant excess manufacturing capacity and under-absorption of our fixed costs, which could
in turn adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.

To maintain our competitive position as the leading developer
and manufacturer of fiber lasers and to meet anticipated demand for our products, we invest significantly in the expansion of our manufacturing and operations throughout the world and may do so in the future. We incurred in the past and will incur
in the future significant costs associated with the acquisition, build-out and preparation of our facilities. We had capital expenditures of $68.2 million and $53.0 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and we expect to incur approximately $60
million to $70 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, in 2013. In connection with these projects, we may incur cost overruns, construction delays, labor difficulties or regulatory issues which could cause our capital expenditures
to be higher than what we currently anticipate, possibly by a material amount, which would in turn adversely impact our operating results. Moreover, we may experience higher costs due to yield loss, production inefficiencies and equipment problems
until any operational issues associated with the opening of new manufacturing facilities are resolved.

The markets for
our products are highly competitive and increased competition could increase our costs, reduce our sales or cause us to lose market share.

The industries in which we operate are characterized by significant price and technological competition. Our fiber laser and amplifier products compete with conventional laser technologies and amplifier
products offered by several well-established companies, some of which are larger and have substantially greater financial, managerial and technical resources, more extensive distribution and service networks, greater sales and marketing capacity,
and larger installed customer bases than we do. Also, we compete with widely used non-laser production methods, such as resistance welding. We believe that competition will be particularly intense from



makers of CO

2,

YAG, disc and direct diode lasers, as these makers of conventional solutions may lower prices to maintain current market share and have committed significant research and development resources to pursue
opportunities related to these technologies.

In addition, we face competition from a growing number of fiber laser makers,
including Rofin-Sinar Technologies, Inc., Trumpf GmbH + Co. KG, GSI Group Inc., Coherent Inc., Hypertherm, Inc., Newport Corporation, The Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., Keopsys SA, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Ltd., Miyachi Unitek Corporation, Raycus
Fiber Laser Technologies Co. Ltd., Maxphotonics Co., Ltd. and JDS Uniphase Corporation. Competition from other fiber laser makers has increased and some have introduced fiber lasers or announced plans to introduce fiber lasers that compete with our
products. We may not be able to successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from our competitors’ products and current or prospective customers may not consider our products to be superior to competitors’ products. To
maintain our competitive position, we believe that we will be required to continue a high level of investment in research and development, application development and customer service and support, and to react to market pricing conditions. We may
not have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments and we may not be able to make the technological advances or price adjustments necessary to maintain our competitive position. We also compete against our OEM customers’
internal production of competitive laser technologies.

The laser and amplifier industries are experiencing declining
average selling prices, which could cause our gross margins to decline and harm our operating results.

Products in the
laser and amplifier industries generally, and our products specifically, are experiencing and may in the future continue to experience a decline in average selling prices (“ASPs”) as a result of new product and technology introductions,
increased competition and price pressures from significant customers. If the ASPs of our products decline further and we are unable to increase our unit volumes, introduce new or enhanced products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to
offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because of our significant fixed costs, we are limited in our ability to reduce total costs quickly in response to any
revenue shortfalls. Because of these factors, we have experienced and we may experience in the future material adverse fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly or annual basis if the ASPs of our products continue to decline.

We have experienced, and expect to experience in the future, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. These fluctuations
may increase the volatility of our stock price.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We believe that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. Factors which may have an influence on our operating results in a
particular quarter include:

•

the increase, decrease, cancellation or rescheduling of significant customer orders;

•

the timing of revenue recognition based on the installation or acceptance of certain products shipped to our customers;

•

seasonality attributable to different purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the year in the areas where we operate;

•

the timing of customer qualification of our products and commencement of volume sales of systems that include our products;

•

our ability to obtain export licenses for our products on a timely basis or at all;

•

the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies;



•

the gain or loss of a key customer;

•

product or customer mix;

•

competitive pricing pressures;

•

our ability to design, manufacture and introduce new products on a cost-effective and timely basis;

•

our ability to manage our inventory levels and any inventory write-downs;

•

the incurrence of expenses to develop and improve application and support capabilities, the benefits of which may not be realized until future periods,
if at all;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

foreign currency fluctuations; and

•

our ability to control expenses.

These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict our operating results. In addition, our ability to accurately predict our operating results is complicated by the fact that many of our
products have long sales cycles, some lasting as long as twelve months. Once a sale is made, our delivery schedule typically ranges from four weeks to four months, and therefore our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that
they are received and will not enhance our ability to predict our results for future quarters. In addition, long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues since customers typically expend significant effort
in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them. Moreover, customers may cancel or reschedule shipments, and production difficulties could delay shipments. Accordingly, our results of operations are
subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter, and we may not be able to accurately predict when these fluctuations will occur.

We may pursue acquisitions and investments in new businesses, products, patents or technologies. These may involve risks which could disrupt our business and may harm our financial condition.

We currently have no binding commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions and have limited experience in making
acquisitions. In the future, we may make acquisitions of and investments in new businesses, products, patents and technologies and expand into new geographic areas, or we may acquire operations, products or technologies that expand our current
capabilities. Acquisitions present a number of potential risks and challenges that could, if not met, disrupt our business operations, increase our operating costs and reduce the value of the acquired company, asset or technology to us. For example,
if we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms. Even if we are successful, we may not be able to integrate the acquired businesses, products, patents or
technologies into our existing business and products. As a result of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, we may misjudge the long-term potential of an acquired business, product, patent or technology, or the acquisition may not
be complementary to our existing business. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and investments, whether or not consummated, may divert our management’s attention and require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations.
In addition, to complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our profitability and result in
dilution to our existing and future stockholders.

Because we lack long-term purchase commitments from our customers,
our sales can be difficult to predict, which could lead to excess or obsolete inventory and adversely affect our operating results.

We generally do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or amplifiers. Our business is characterized by short-term purchase orders and shipment
schedules



and, in some cases, orders may be cancelled or delayed without significant penalty. As a result, it is difficult to forecast our revenues and to determine the appropriate levels of inventory
required to meet future demand. In addition, due to the absence of long-term volume purchase agreements, we forecast our revenues and plan our production and inventory levels based upon the demand forecasts of our OEM customers, end users and
distributors, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. This could lead to increased inventory levels and increased carrying costs and risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to unanticipated reductions in purchases by our
customers. In this regard, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling $8.2 million, $6.1 million and $2.7 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These provisions were recorded as a result of changes in
market prices of certain components, the value of those inventories that was realizable through finished product sales and uncertainties related to the recoverability of the value of inventories due to technological changes and excess quantities. If
our OEM customers, end users or distributors fail to accurately forecast the demand for our products, fail to accurately forecast the timing of such demand, or are unable to consistently negotiate acceptable purchase order terms with customers, our
results of operations may be adversely affected.

We rely on the significant experience and specialized expertise of our
senior management and scientific staff and if we are unable to retain these key employees and attract other highly skilled personnel necessary to grow our business successfully, our business and results of operations could suffer.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our executive officers, particularly our
founder and chief executive officer, Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, age 74, and the managing director of our German subsidiary IPG Laser GmbH and Senior Vice-President, Europe, Dr. Eugene Scherbakov, age 65, our highly trained team of
scientists, many of whom have numerous years of experience and specialized expertise in optical fibers, semiconductors and optical component technology, and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel, any of whom
may leave, which could harm our business. The members of our scientific staff who are expected to make significant individual contributions to our business are also members of our executive management team as disclosed under Item 10,
“Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” below. Furthermore, our business requires scientists and engineers with experience in several disciplines, including physics, optics, materials sciences, chemistry and electronics.
We will need to continue to recruit and retain highly skilled scientists and engineers for certain functions. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled research and
development, managerial, operations, sales, marketing and customer service personnel. If we fail to attract, integrate and retain the necessary personnel, our ability to extend and maintain our scientific expertise and grow our business could suffer
significantly.

We are subject to litigation alleging that we are infringing third-party intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property claims could result in costly litigation and harm our business.

In recent years, there has been
significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in many technology-based industries, including our own. We face risks and uncertainties in connection with such litigation, including the risk that patents issued to others may harm our
ability to do business; that there could be existing patents of which we are unaware that could be pertinent to our business; and that it is not possible for us to know whether there are patent applications pending that our products might infringe
upon, since patent applications often are not disclosed until a patent is issued or published. Moreover, the frequency with which new patents are granted and the diversity of jurisdictions in which they are granted make it impractical and expensive
for us to monitor all patents that may be relevant to our business.

From time to time, we have been notified of allegations
and claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties. In 2007, we settled two patent infringement lawsuits filed against us and in 2010 we settled another patent infringement lawsuit filed against us.
Following a federal jury trial in 2011, we won a patent infringement lawsuit asserted by IMRA America, Inc. in 2006 alleging that certain products we produce infringe one U.S. patent allegedly owned by IMRA America. IMRA America has also



informed us that it has patents and applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions directed to fiber lasers and fiber amplifiers, but has not asserted them against us. We are
engaged in opposition proceedings in Japan and Germany with respect to two patents allegedly owned by IMRA America related to the patent IMRA America asserted against us in the United States. In Japan, the patent office invalidated two claims, and
subsequently the Japanese IP High Court concluded that the remaining 49 claims of an IMRA America patent were invalid. IMRA is appealing the IP High Court decision. The German Patent and Trademark Office concluded that IMRA’s claims
corresponding to its original patent request and several auxiliary requests were not patentable and found that claims relating to IMRA’s final auxiliary request were patentable. We are appealing a portion of this decision favorable to IMRA.

There can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose without a material effect any claims or other allegations made or
asserted in the future. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Even if we ultimately are successful on the merits of any such litigation or re-examination, legal and administrative proceedings related to intellectual property are typically
expensive and time-consuming, generate negative publicity and divert financial and managerial resources. Some litigants may have greater financial resources than we have and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property
litigation more easily than we can.

If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation brought against us, it could
affect our ability to sell our products and materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. These developments could adversely affect our ability to compete for customers and increase our revenues. Plaintiffs in
intellectual property cases often seek, and sometimes obtain, injunctive relief. Intellectual property litigation commenced against us could force us to take actions that could be harmful to our business, competitive position, results of operations
and financial condition, including the following:

•

stop selling our products or using the technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property;

•

pay actual monetary damages, royalties, lost profits or increased damages and the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees, which individually or in the
aggregate may be substantial; and

•

attempt to obtain a license to use the relevant intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.

In addition, intellectual property lawsuits can be brought by third parties against OEMs and end users that
incorporate our products into their systems or processes. In some cases, we indemnify OEMs against third-party infringement claims relating to our products and we often make representations affirming, among other things, that our products do not
infringe the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, we may incur liabilities in connection with lawsuits against our customers. Any such lawsuits, whether or not they have merit, could be time-consuming to defend, damage our reputation
or result in substantial and unanticipated costs.

Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary
technologies could result in the unauthorized use of our technologies by third parties, hurt our competitive position and adversely affect our operating results.

We rely on patents, trade secret laws, contractual agreements, technical know-how and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our products, product development and manufacturing activities
from unauthorized copying by third parties. Our patents do not cover all of our technologies, systems, products and product components and may not prevent third parties from unauthorized copying of our technologies, products and product components.
We seek to protect our proprietary technology under laws affording protection for trade secrets. We also seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by requiring employees to enter into agreements providing for the
maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. We have significant international operations and we are subject to foreign laws which differ in many respects from U.S. laws. Policing
unauthorized use of our trade secret technologies throughout the world and proving misappropriation of our technologies are particularly difficult, especially due



to the number of our employees and operations in numerous foreign countries. The steps that we take to acquire ownership of our employees’ inventions and trade secrets in foreign countries
may not have been effective under all such local laws, which could expose us to potential claims or the inability to protect intellectual property developed by our employees. Furthermore, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the trade
secret and other intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may adversely affect our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property positions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to determine the
scope of our confidential information and trade secret protection. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants and other suppliers to protect our confidential information that we deliver to them. However, there can be no
assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that we will be able to effectively enforce them or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.

Given our reliance on trade secret laws, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we have made. Therefore, our
intellectual property efforts may be insufficient to maintain our competitive advantage or to stop other parties from commercializing similar products or technologies. Many countries outside of the United States afford little or no protection to
trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation can be time-consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee that we will have the resources to fully enforce our rights. If we are unable to prevent
misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property rights, or the independent development or design of similar technologies, our competitive position and operating results could suffer.

We depend upon internal production and on outside single or limited-source suppliers for many of our key components and raw
materials, including cutting-edge optics and materials. Any interruption in the supply of these key components and raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations.

We rely exclusively on our own production capabilities to manufacture certain of our key components, such as semiconductor diodes,
specialty optical fibers and optical components. We do not have redundant production lines for some of our components, such as our diodes and some other components, which are made at a single manufacturing facility. These may not be readily
available from other sources at our current costs. If our manufacturing activities were obstructed or hampered significantly, it could take a considerable length of time, or it could increase our costs, for us to resume manufacturing or find
alternative sources of supply. Many of the tools and equipment we use are custom-designed, and it could take a significant period of time to repair or replace them. Our three major manufacturing facilities are located in Oxford, Massachusetts;
Burbach, Germany; and Fryazino, Russia. Despite our efforts to mitigate the impact of any flood, fire, natural disaster, political unrest, act of terrorism, war, outbreak of disease or other similar event, our business could be adversely affected to
the extent that we do not have redundant production capabilities if any of our three major manufacturing facilities or equipment should become inoperable, inaccessible, damaged or destroyed.

Also, we purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture our products and other components, such as semiconductor wafer substrates,
diode packages, modulators, micro-optics, bulk optics and high-power beam delivery products, from single or limited-source suppliers. We typically purchase our components and materials through purchase orders or agreed-upon terms and conditions and
we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with many of these suppliers. These suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time and may be particularly susceptible to prevailing economic
conditions. Some of our suppliers are also our competitors. Some of our suppliers reduced their inventory levels and manufacturing capacity because of the recent recession or other reasons. As a result, we experienced and may in the future
experience longer lead times or delays in fulfillment of our orders. Furthermore, other than our current suppliers, there are a limited number of entities from whom we could obtain these supplies. We do not anticipate that we would be able to
purchase these components or raw materials that we require in a short period of time or at the same cost from other sources in commercial quantities or that have our required performance specifications. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any
of these components or materials, or the inability to obtain these components and materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could adversely affect our business. If our suppliers face financial or
other difficulties, if our



suppliers do not maintain sufficient inventory on hand or if there are significant changes in demand for the components and materials we obtain from them, they could limit the availability of
these components and materials to us, which in turn could adversely affect our business.

Failure to effectively build
and expand our direct field service and support organization could have an adverse effect on our business.

We believe
that it will become increasingly important for us to provide rapid, responsive service directly to our customers throughout the world and to build and expand our own personnel resources to provide these services. Any actual or perceived lack of
direct field service in the locations where we sell or try to sell our products may negatively impact our sales efforts and, consequently, our revenues. Accordingly, we have an ongoing effort to develop our direct support systems worldwide. This
requires us to recruit and train additional qualified field service and support personnel as well as maintain effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to our customers in various countries. We may not be able to attract
and train additional qualified personnel to expand our direct support operations successfully. We may not be able to find and engage additional qualified third-party resources to supplement and enhance our direct support operations. Further, we may
incur significant costs in providing these direct field and support services. Failure to implement our direct support operation effectively could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our operating results may suffer.

A few customers account for a significant portion of our sales, and if we lose any of these customers or they
significantly curtail their purchases of our products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely
on a few customers for a significant portion of our sales. In the aggregate, our top five customers accounted for 16%, 17% and 19% of our consolidated net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our largest customer is located in China and
accounted for 7%, 8% and 7% of sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is located in China. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or amplifiers. Our business is characterized by
short-term purchase orders and shipment schedules. If any of our principal customers discontinues its relationship with us, replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers downturns in its business, our business and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

We depend on our OEM customers and system integrators and their ability to incorporate our
products into their systems.

Our sales depend in part on our ability to maintain existing and secure new OEM
customers. Our revenues also depend in part upon the ability of our current and potential OEM customers and system integrators to develop and sell systems that incorporate our laser and amplifier products. The commercial success of these systems
depends to a substantial degree on the efforts of these OEM customers and system integrators to develop and market products that incorporate our technologies. Relationships and experience with traditional laser makers, limited marketing resources,
reluctance to invest in research and development and other factors affecting these OEM customers and third-party system integrators could have a substantial impact upon our financial results. If OEM customers or integrators are not able to adapt
existing tools or develop new systems to take advantage of the features and benefits of fiber lasers, then the opportunities to increase our revenues and profitability may be severely limited or delayed. Furthermore, if our OEM customers or
third-party system integrators experience financial or other difficulties that adversely affect their operations, our financial condition or results of operations may also be adversely affected.

Our inability to manage risks associated with our international customers and operations could adversely affect our business.

We have significant facilities in and our products are sold in numerous countries. The United States, Germany, Japan,
Russia, China, Italy and Korea are our principal markets. A substantial majority of our revenues



are derived from customers, and we have substantial tangible assets, outside of the United States. We anticipate that foreign sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our
revenues in the foreseeable future. Our operations and sales in these markets are subject to risks inherent in international business activities, including:

•

longer accounts receivable collection periods and less developed credit assessment and collection procedures;

•

fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies;

•

changes in a specific country’s or region’s economic conditions, such as recession;

•

compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory requirements, including
uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers;

•

certification requirements;

•

environmental regulations;

•

less effective protection of intellectual property rights in some countries;

•

potentially adverse tax consequences;

•

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our customers, which affect the timing of their spending;

•

political, legal and economic instability, foreign conflicts, and the impact of regional and global infectious illnesses in the countries in which we
and our customers, suppliers, manufacturers and subcontractors are located;

•

preference for locally produced products;

•

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas and cultures;

•

seasonal reductions in business activities;

•

fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions;

•

investment restrictions or requirements;

•

repatriation restrictions or requirements; and

•

export and import restrictions.

Political and economic instability and changes in governmental regulations could adversely affect both our ability to effectively operate our foreign sales offices and the ability of our foreign suppliers
to supply us with required materials or services. Any interruption or delay in the supply of our required components, products, materials or services, or our inability to obtain these components, materials, products or services from alternate
sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders.

We are subject to risks of doing business in Russia through our subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus, which provides components and test equipment
to us and sells finished fiber devices to customers in Russia and neighboring countries. Further, over 20% of our sales are to customers in China. The results of our operations, business prospects and facilities in these two countries are subject to
the economic and political environment in Russia and China. In recent years, both countries have undergone substantial political, economic and social change. As is typical of an emerging market, neither China nor Russia possesses a well-developed
business, legal and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature free market economy. In addition, tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes, which can occur frequently. The
future economic direction of these two emerging market countries remains largely dependent upon the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the government, together with tax,



legal, regulatory and political developments. Our failure to manage the risks associated with our operations in Russia and China and our other existing and potential future international business
operations could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations.

We are subject to many laws governing our
international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which we operate. Violations of
these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

Foreign currency transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales, cost of sales and operating margins and could
result in exchange losses.

We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we
operate. In 2012, our net sales outside the United States represented a substantial majority of our total sales. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using
a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations by changing the U.S. dollar value of sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot accurately
predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency transaction or translation risks, and any volatility in
currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.

Changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results.

As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Significant judgment
is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates, transfer pricing rules, changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the tax laws. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. From time to time the United States,
foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of rules to companies, including various announcements from the United States government potentially impacting our ability to defer taxes on international
earnings. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no
assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our products could contain defects, which may reduce sales of those products, harm market acceptance of our fiber laser
products or result in claims against us.

The manufacture of our fiber lasers and amplifiers involves highly complex
and precise processes. Despite testing by us and our customers, errors have been found, and may be found in the future, in our products. These defects may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs, incur additional costs
related to a recall, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers. These problems could result in, among other things, loss of revenues or a delay in revenue
recognition, loss of market share, harm to our reputation or a delay or loss of market acceptance of our fiber laser products. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our fiber laser and amplifier products could also result in
personal injury or financial or other damages to our customers, which in turn could damage market acceptance of our products. Our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses. A product liability claim brought against us, even if
unsuccessful, could be time-consuming and costly to defend.



We may experience lower than expected manufacturing yields, which would adversely
affect our gross margins.

The manufacture of semiconductor diodes and the packaging of them is a highly complex
process. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in achieving acceptable product yields from diode and packaging operations. We have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields for our diodes and packaged diodes.
This occurs during the production of new designs and the installation and start-up of new process technologies. If we do not achieve planned yields, our product costs could increase resulting in lower gross margins, and key component availability
would decrease.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may
create uncertainty regarding compliance matters.

Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as the rules
and regulations of self-regulatory organizations such as NASDAQ and the NYSE, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial
expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations and other laws such as
anti-bribery laws. These laws, rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert
management’s attention from business operations. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. New or changed laws, regulations and standards
are subject to varying interpretations in many cases. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time. Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise
current practices, policies and procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities
intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may also be harmed.

Failure to maintain effective internal controls may cause a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial
statements or to cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the SEC and adversely affect our stock price.

The
SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K that contain an
assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting. Although we test our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the Section 404 requirements, our failure to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could result in an adverse
reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or a delay in our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which ultimately could negatively impact our stock
price.

Difficulties with our information technology systems could harm our business and results of operation. If our
network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.

Like many multinational corporations, we maintain several information technology systems, including software products licensed from third
parties. These systems vary from country to country. Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, the hacking into or disruption caused by the unauthorized access by third parties or loss of license rights could disrupt our
ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC. Any such



failure, misuse, hacking, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management’s attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations. In addition, a significant
failure of our various information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

As part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our information technology system. While
our system is designed with access security, if a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including information regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business,
litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to
fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other
confidential business information, employee information or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched
against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal
liability and negatively impact our future sales.

We are subject to export control regulations that could restrict our
ability to increase our international sales and may adversely affect our business.

A significant part of our business
involves the export of our products to other countries. The U.S. government has in place a number of laws and regulations that control the export, re-export or transfer of U.S.-origin products, software and technology. The governments of other
countries in which we do business have similar regulations regarding products, software and technology originating in those countries. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain a license before we can export, re-export or transfer
certain products, software or technology. The requirement to obtain a license could put us at a competitive disadvantage by restricting our ability to sell products to customers in certain countries or by giving rise to delays or expenses related to
obtaining a license. In applying for a license and responding to questions from licensing authorities, we have experienced and, in the future, may experience delays in obtaining export licenses based on issues solely within the control of the
applicable government agency. Under the discretion of the issuing government agency, an export license may permit the export of one unit to a single customer or multiple units to one or more customers. Licenses may also include conditions that limit
the use, resale, transfer, re-export, modification, disassembly, or transfer of a product, software or technology after it is exported without first obtaining permission from the relevant government agency. Failure to comply with these laws and
regulations could result in government sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges, debarment from government contracts and a loss of revenues. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain required export licenses
may require us to defer shipments for substantial periods or cancel orders. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our operations and, as a result, our financial results could suffer.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect
our business, operating results and financial condition.

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various
federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including those relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, product composition and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic materials. We could incur
costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.
Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire
additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses in order to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. At this time, we do not believe the costs to maintain compliance with current
environmental laws to be material. Although we do not currently anticipate that such costs



will become material, if such costs were to become material in the future, whether due to unanticipated changes in environmental laws, unanticipated changes in our operations or other
unanticipated changes, we may be required to dedicate additional staff or financial resources in order to maintain compliance. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur in the future as a result of
the lack of, or failure to obtain, permits, human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.

Our ability to
access financial markets to raise capital or finance a portion of our working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs may be adversely affected by factors beyond our control and could negatively impact our ability to finance our
operations, meet certain obligations or implement our operating strategy.

We occasionally borrow under our existing
credit facilities to fund operations, including working capital investments. Our major credit lines in the United States and Germany expire in June 2015 and June 2014, respectively. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States
and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the
financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current
and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, unprecedented volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and general economic
downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our
operating strategy could be adversely affected.

We also may in the future be required to raise capital through public or
private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our
common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.

Substantial sales of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options could
cause our stock price to decline.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the perception that
sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we had 51,359,247 shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 2,789,752 shares subject to outstanding options. We have registered
all shares of common stock that we may issue under our stock option plans and our employee stock ownership plan. In addition, all of the unregistered shares of our common stock are now eligible for sale under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the
Securities Act. As these shares are issued, they may be freely sold in the public market subject, in the case of any awards under our stock-based compensation plans, to applicable vesting requirements.

We currently have the ability to file a registration statement and immediately offer and sell common stock, preferred stock, warrants,
debt and convertible securities because of our current status a well-known seasoned issuer. In the future, we may issue additional options, warrants or other securities convertible into our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our
common stock or other securities under any future registration statement that we may file could lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and three trusts he created collectively control
approximately 35% of our voting power and have a significant influence on the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval, including a change in corporate control.

Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and IP Fibre Devices (UK) Ltd. (IPFD), of which
Dr. Gapontsev is the managing director, together with three trusts he created beneficially own approximately 35% of our common stock. Trustees of the trusts are officers or employees of the Company.



Dr. Gapontsev and the trusts have a significant influence on the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including:

•

election of our directors;

•

amendment of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws; and

•

approval of mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

Dr. Gapontsev and the trusts may vote their shares of our common stock in ways that are adverse to the interests of other holders of
our common stock. These significant ownership interests could delay, prevent or cause a change in control of our company, any of which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company, even
if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
by-laws, including certain provisions that will take effect when Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev (together with his affiliates and associates) ceases to beneficially own an aggregate of 25% or more of our outstanding voting securities, may
discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change of control, even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders. The existence of these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares
of our common stock. These provisions include:

•

authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock;

•

establishing a classified board;

•

providing that directors may only be removed for cause;

•

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;

•

limiting the persons who may call a special meeting of stockholders;

•

establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters to be submitted to a
stockholder vote; and

•

supermajority stockholder approval to change these provisions.

Provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with our company or obtaining control
of our company. Specifically, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which will apply to our company following such time as Dr. Gapontsev (together with his affiliates and associates) ceases to beneficially own 25% or more of
the total voting power of our outstanding shares, may prohibit business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.

If securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.

The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us.
If one or more of these analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. Further, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our
stock price to decline.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “IPGP”. The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported on the
Nasdaq Global Market.

As of February 25, 2013, there were 51,415,585 shares of our common stock outstanding held by
approximately 55 holders of record, which does not include beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the names of various securities brokers, dealers and registered clearing agencies.



Stock Price Performance Graph

The following Stock Price Performance Graph and related information includes comparisons required by the SEC. The graph does not
constitute “soliciting material” and should not be deemed “filed” or incorporated by reference into any other filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the
extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference into such filing.

The following graph presents the
cumulative shareholder returns for our Common Stock compared with the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P Technology Sector Index. We selected these comparative groups due to industry similarities and the fact that they contain several direct
competitors.

COMPARISON OF CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN

AMONG THE COMPANY, THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX AND S&P 500

TECHNOLOGY SECTOR INDEX

The above graph represents and compares the value, through December 31, 2012, of a hypothetical
investment of $100 made at the closing price on December 31, 2007 in each of (i) our common stock, (ii) the NASDAQ Composite Stock Index and (iii) the S&P 500 Technology Sector Index, in each case assuming the reinvestment of
dividends. The stock price performance shown in this graph is not necessarily indicative of, and not is intended to suggest, future stock price performance.



Dividends

We declared and paid a special cash dividend on our capital stock in December 2012 of $33.4 million or $0.65 per share. We anticipate that we will retain future earnings to support operations, fund
acquisitions and to finance the growth and development of our business. Therefore, we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking
into account any business conditions, any contractual and legal restrictions on our payment of dividends, and our financial condition, operating results, cash needs and growth plans. In addition, current agreements with certain of our lenders
contain, and future loan agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that generally prohibit us from paying cash dividends, making any distribution on any class of stock or making stock repurchases.

Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities

There have been no sales of unregistered securities during the past three years.

Use of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock

On March 7, 2012, we closed a public offering of 3,250,000 shares of our common stock, consisting of 3,050,000 shares issued and sold
by us and 200,000 shares sold by our chairman and chief executive officer, Dr. Valentin P. Gapontsev. The price per share to the public in the public offering was $54.30. The offer and sale of all of the shares in the public offering were
registered under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-179722), which was declared effective by the SEC on March 2, 2012. Bank of America Merrill Lynch served as sole bookrunning manager for this
offering and Needham & Company and Stifel Nicolaus Weisel served as co-managers. We raised approximately $167.9 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $8.6
million. No payments were made by us to directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates or our affiliates, other than payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for salaries. We did
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering by Dr. Gapontsev. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our public offering as described in our automatic shelf registration statement relating to
the securities offered in this offering that was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2012 and to a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in the shelf registration statement, which prospectus supplement was filed with the SEC on
March 2, 2012, pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act. We invested the funds received in money market funds and treasury bills.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with
Item 6, “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Overview

We develop and
manufacture a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing. We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and end users. We
market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force.

We are vertically integrated such that we
design and manufacture most of our key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also manufacture certain complementary products used with our lasers,
including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical heads and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based systems for certain markets and applications

Description of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses

Net
sales.

We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode lasers, communications systems, laser systems and complementary products. We sell our products through our direct sales
organization and our network of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, communications systems and medical laser systems to end users. We
also sell our products to end users that build their own systems which incorporate our products or use our products as an energy or light source. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their
system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser or amplifier specifications. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months.

Sales of our products generally are recognized upon shipment, provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is
reasonably assured. Our sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments.



We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within
our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs.

The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as
decreased manufacturing costs and increases in unit volumes, increased competition, the introduction of new products and market share considerations. In the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications.
Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that purchase multiple units.

Cost of sales.

Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct
labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies,
leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory
obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as excess or obsolete.

Due to our vertical integration strategy and ongoing investment in plant and machinery, we maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not adjust these fixed costs quickly enough to
adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross margin is therefore significantly affected by our sales volume and the corresponding utilization of capacity and absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses.

Sales and marketing.

Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of costs related to compensation,
trade shows, professional and technical conferences, travel, facilities, depreciation of equipment used for demonstration purposes and other marketing costs.

Research and development.

Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation, development expenses related to the design of our products and certain
components, and facilities costs. Costs related to product development are recorded as research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

General and administrative.

Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, legal and other
administrative personnel, outside legal and professional fees, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses.

Factors and Trends
That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results

In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following
factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance.

Net
sales.

Our net sales grew from $229.1 million in 2008 to $562.5 million in 2012, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25%. Net sales growth was driven by (i) increasing demand for our
products, fueled by the decreasing average cost per watt of output power and resulting increased cost competitiveness compared to traditional lasers, (ii) the introduction of new products, including our high-power lasers with higher output
power levels, (iii) the growing market acceptance of fiber lasers and (iv) the development of new applications for our products and new OEM customer relationships. Our annual revenue growth rates have varied. Net sales increased by 19%,
59% and 61% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. However in 2009, our net sales decreased by 19%, primarily due to the global economic downturn. Our growth rate was 21% in 2008.



Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by our customers, particularly
by manufacturers in the materials processing market, which include general manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 88% of our revenues in 2012 were from customers in the materials processing
market. Although applications in this market are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital
expenditures by customers in the materials processing market and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending.

Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the shipment,
installation and acceptance of products at our customers’ facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the
year in the regions where we operate. Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. Furthermore, net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new
applications in the end markets that we serve. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new
customers.

Gross margin.

Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by
total net sales in any period, by product mix, that is, the percentage of our revenue in the period that is attributable to higher or lower-power products, and by other factors, some of which are not under our control.

Our product mix affects our margins because the selling price per watt is generally higher for low and mid-power devices and certain
specialty products than for high-power devices sold in large volumes. The overall cost of high-power lasers may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales of larger volumes of higher-power products
because they use a greater number of optical components and drive economies of scale in manufacturing. Also, the margins on systems can be lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources, depending on the configuration, volume and
competitive forces, among other factors.

We invested $68.2 million, $53.0 million and $28.4 million in capital expenditures
in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Most of this investment relates to expansion of our manufacturing capacity.

A high
proportion of our costs is fixed so they are generally difficult or slow to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. Gross margins generally decline if production volumes are lower as
a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because utilization of capacity and the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. In addition, absorption of fixed
costs can benefit gross margins due to an increase in production that is not sold and placed into inventory. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross margin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or
choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline in sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues or inventory write-downs, our gross margins will be
negatively affected.

We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or
determined to be excess. Any write-off of such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling $8.2 million, $6.1 million and
$2.7 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Sales and marketing expense.

We expect
to continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization, build and expand applications centers, hire additional personnel involved in marketing in our existing and new geographic locations, increase the number of units for demonstration
purposes and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the aggregate.



Research and development expense.

We plan to continue to
invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products and systems. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. In general, if net sales
continue to increase we expect research and development expense to increase in the aggregate.

General and administrative
expense.

We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to invest in systems and resources to support our worldwide operations. Legal expenses vary from quarter to quarter based primarily upon
the level of litigation activity.

Major customers.

While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large
percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our annual net sales were 16% in 2012, 17% in 2011 and 19% in 2010. Sales to our
largest customer accounted for 7%, 8% and 7% of our net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our net sales to our
significant customers will continue to change. If any of our significant customers were to substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis we
re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventories, income taxes and the fair value of certain debt and equity instruments including stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical
experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. The accounting policies described below are those which, in our opinion, involve the most significant application of
judgment, or involve complex estimation, and which could, if different judgments or estimates were made, materially affect our reported results of operations and financial position.

Revenue Recognition.

We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605. Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. These separate units generally consist of
equipment and installation. The consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices. The selling price of equipment is based on vendor-specific objective evidence and the
selling price of installation is based on third-party evidence. Applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied separately for each separate unit of accounting. Equipment revenue generally is recognized upon the transfer of ownership which
is typically at the time of shipment. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation service which typically occurs within 30 to 90 days of delivery. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a
reduction to revenue. Rights of return generally are not included in sales arrangements.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts.

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer
creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of outstanding receivables.

Inventory.

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Inventory
includes parts and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for inventory items to provide for an estimated amount of excess or obsolete inventory. The reserve is based upon a review of
inventory materials on hand, which we compare with estimated future usage and age. In



addition, we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with respect
to any part with costs in excess of current market value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently difficult, particularly given that we make highly specialized components and products. We determine the valuation of excess and
obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often have limited information on which to base our
forecasts. If future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory provisions may be required. Because of our vertical integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales
could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation. We recorded inventory charges of $8.2 million, $6.1 million and $2.7 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Stock-based compensation.

Stock-based compensation is included in the following financial statement
captions as follows:

We allocate and record stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period.

We calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions
used to calculate the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use
different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model or the calculation of compensation were as follows:

As stock-based compensation expense recorded in our statements of operations is based on options
ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates.

We have offered an employee stock purchase plan covering our U.S. and German employees. The plan allows employees who participate to
purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions at a 15% discount to the lower of the stock price on the first day or last day of the six-month purchase period. Payroll



deductions may not exceed 10% of the employee’s compensation. Compensation expense related to the employee stock purchase plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was
approximately $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Income Taxes and Deferred
Taxes.

Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.

We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and tax returns in numerous international jurisdictions. We must
estimate our income tax expense after considering, among other factors, intercompany transactions on an arm’s length basis, differing tax rates between jurisdictions, allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes in enacted
tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. As we continue to expand globally, there is a risk that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various jurisdictions in
which we do business, a governmental agency may disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes. Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations where the tax
treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another jurisdiction.

Deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
“temporary differences.” The tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2012, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of
$4.7 million. If insufficient evidence of our ability to generate future taxable income arises, we may be required to record a valuation allowance against these assets, which will result in additional income tax expense. On a quarterly basis, we
evaluate whether the deferred tax assets may be realized in the future and assess the need for a valuation allowance.

Changes
in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Act”) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. Because a change in
tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, certain provisions of the Act benefiting our 2012 U.S. federal taxes, including the research and experimentation credit, cannot be recognized in our 2012 financial results and instead will be
reflected in our 2013 financial results. We estimate that a benefit of approximately $0.8 million will be accounted for as a discrete item in our tax provision for the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we expect that the Act’s extension of
these provisions through the end of 2013 will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2013 by approximately 0.4 percentage points as compared to 2012.

We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Reserves recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of
a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is “more likely than not” to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised
by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2012, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $5.4 million that,
if recognized, would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.

At December 31, 2012, we had $226.0 million of
cash in the United States and the remainder of $158.1 million at foreign locations. Cash outside of the United States is intended to fund working capital and business expansion outside the United States.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth selected statement of operations data for the periods indicated in dollar amounts and expressed as a percentage of net sales.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2012 to Year Ended December 31, 2011

Net sales.

Net sales increased by $88.0 million, or 18.6%, to $562.5 million in 2012 from $474.5
million in 2011. The table below sets forth sales by application (in thousands, except for percentages):

Sales for materials processing applications increased primarily due to higher sales of high-power and
medium-power lasers used in cutting and welding applications and pulsed lasers used in marking and engraving



applications. We continue to see increased acceptance of fiber laser technology. A growing number of OEM customers have developed cutting systems that use our high power lasers and sales of these
systems are gaining sales from gas laser systems. In addition, new welding processes using fiber lasers have been developed, increasing sales of lasers for this application, which are replacing traditional laser and non-laser welding technologies.
We also increased sales of pulsed lasers used for marking and engraving applications due to increased demand in consumer electronics applications. The increase in other applications sales relates primarily to an increase in sales of high-power,
high-brightness lasers used in advanced applications.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of
sales increased by $40.6 million, or 18.7%, to $257.8 million in 2012 from $217.2 million in 2011. Our gross margin remained consistent at 54.2% in 2012 from 54.2% in 2011. Gross margin was positively affected by product mix and by reductions
in direct product cost due to continued reduction of the cost of internally manufactured components. This benefit was offset by a decrease in absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Expenses related to inventory reserves and other valuation
adjustments increased by $2.1 million to $8.2 million, or 1.5% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to $6.1 million, or 1.3% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and marketing expense increased by $2.1 million, or 9.7%, to $23.8
million in 2012 from $21.7 million in 2011, primarily as a result of increases in personnel costs, depreciation of product used for demonstration purposes and advertising and trade show expenses. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing
expense decreased to 4.2% in 2012 from 4.6% in 2011. As we continue to expand our worldwide sales organization, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the aggregate.

Research and development expense.

Research and development expense increased by $6.0 million, or 23.5%, to
$31.4 million in 2012 from $25.4 million in 2011. This increase was primarily as a result of increases in personnel costs and in material expenses. Research and development activity continues to focus on enhancing the performance of our internally
manufactured components, refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields, the development of new products operating at different wavelengths and higher output powers and new complementary accessories. As a percentage of sales, research
and development expense increased to 5.6% in 2012 from 5.4% in 2011. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and that research and development expense will increase in the aggregate.

General and administrative expense.

General and administrative expense increased by $1.8 million, or 4.8%,
to $39.2 million in 2012 from $37.4 million in 2011, primarily due to increased personnel cost, increased recruitment costs and increased travel expenses offset by decreased legal expense. Legal expense decreased following a favorable verdict
in 2011 in a patent infringement lawsuit. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense decreased to 7.0% in 2012 from 7.9% in 2011. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we invest to support the expected growth
in net sales.

Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses.

We
estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2012 would have been $14.3 million higher, gross margin would have been $7.8 million higher and operating expenses in total would have been $2.1 million higher. The measures
that assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2011 are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011 for the respective currencies, which were Euro 1=US$1.39,
Japanese Yen 1=US$0.01, Chinese Yuan 1=US$0.15 and Russian Ruble 1=US$0.03.

Gain (loss) on foreign
exchange.

We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $1.4 million in 2012 as compared to a gain of $2.9 million in 2011. The change was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the
Euro, Russian Ruble and Japanese Yen.

Interest income (expense), net.

Interest income
(expense), net was $0.3 million of income in 2012 compared to $0.7 million of expense in 2011. The increase in income is the result of increases in interest-bearing deposits during the period as well as increases in cash and cash equivalents.



Provision for income taxes

.    Provision for income taxes was
$61.5 million in 2012 compared to $53.6 million in 2011, representing an effective tax rate of 29.4% in 2012 and 30.7% in 2011. The increase in the provision for income taxes was due to an increase in income before the provision for income taxes,
while the decrease in the effective rate was due to the proportion of income earned in countries with lower enacted tax rates.

Net income.

Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $27.2 million to $145.0
million in 2012 from $117.8 million in 2011. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales increased by 1 percentage point to 25.8% in 2012 from 24.8% in 2011 due to the factors described above.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2011 to Year Ended December 31, 2010

Net sales.

Net sales increased by $175.2 million, or 58.6%, to $474.5 million in 2011 from $299.3
million in 2010. The table below sets forth sales by application (in thousands, except for percentages):

Sales for materials processing applications increased due to substantially increased sales of high-power
lasers used in cutting and welding applications and pulsed lasers used in marking and engraving applications. Sales for communications applications increased due to increased sales of amplifiers in both the United States and Russia. Sales for
medical applications increased due to increased demand from our established customer in the United States and sales to new customers in Europe and Asia. The increase in sales of advanced applications was due to higher sales of high-power lasers used
in university applications partially offset by decreased sales for optical pumping and research and development applications.

Cost of sales and gross margin.

Cost of sales increased by $64.4 million, or 42.2%, to $217.2 million
in 2011 from $152.8 million in 2010. Our gross margin increased to 54.2% in 2011 from 48.9% in 2010. The increase in gross margin was the result of an increase in net sales and more favorable absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs due to
an increase in production volume. In addition, cost of sales benefited from a reduction in the cost per watt of our diodes and lower costs associated with greater use of internally manufactured components and accessories.

Expenses related to inventory reserves and other valuation adjustments increased by $3.4 million to $6.1 million, or 1.3% of
sales, for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $2.7 million, or 0.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Sales and marketing expense.

Sales and marketing expense increased by $2.6 million, or 13.7%, to $21.7 million in 2011 from $19.1 million in 2010, primarily as a
result of an increase in personnel costs due to an increase in headcount and bonus accruals. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense decreased to 4.6% in 2011 from 6.4% in 2010.

Research and development expense.

Research and development expense increased by $6.2 million, or 32.7%, to
$25.4 million in 2011 from $19.2 million in 2010. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in personnel, consultant costs, and an increase in materials used in research and development activities. The increase in personnel costs was
driven primarily by increases in headcount and bonus accruals. Research and



development activity continues to focus on enhancing the performance of our internally manufactured components, refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields, developing new
products operating at different wavelengths and higher output powers and new complementary accessories used with our products. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense decreased to 5.4% in 2011 from 6.4% in 2010.

General and administrative expense.

General and administrative expense increased by $8.8 million, or 30.7%,
to $37.4 million in 2011 from $28.6 million in 2010, primarily due to a $5.7 million increase in personnel attributable to higher bonuses and stock compensation and $2.3 million increase in accounting and legal fees primarily related to
higher legal costs incurred in defending a patent infringement action that went to trial in 2011. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense decreased to 7.9% in 2011 from 9.6% in 2010.

Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses.

We estimate that if exchange rates
had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2011 would have been $17.2 million lower, gross margin would have been $7.1 million lower and operating expenses in total would have been $2.0 million lower. The measures that assume constant exchange
rates between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010 are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010 for the respective currencies, which were Euro 1=US$1.33, Japanese Yen 1= US$0.01 and
Russian Ruble 1=US$0.03.

Gain (loss) on foreign exchange.

We incurred a foreign exchange
gain of $2.9 million in 2011 as compared to a gain of $0.8 million in 2010. The change was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen.

Interest expense, net.

Interest expense, net was $0.7 million in 2011 compared to $1.2 million in
2010.

Provision for income taxes.

Provision for income taxes was $53.6 million in 2011 compared
to $24.9 million in 2010, representing an effective tax rate of 30.7% in 2011 and 31.4% in 2010. The increase in the provision for income taxes was due to an increase in income before the provision for income taxes, while the decrease in the
effective rate was due to the proportion of income earned in countries with lower enacted tax rates.

Net
income.

Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $63.8 million to $117.8 million in 2011 from $54.0 million in 2010. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage
of our net sales increased by 6.8 percentage points to 24.8% in 2011 from 18.0% in 2010 due to the factors described above.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2012 consisted of cash and cash equivalents
of $384.1 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of $61.4 million and working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) of $155.5 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $180.2 million,
short-term investments of $25.5 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of $49.8 million and working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $135.1 million as of December 31, 2011. The
increase in cash and cash equivalents of $203.9 million from December 31, 2011 relates primarily to net cash received in the follow-on public stock offering of $167.9 million, net of offering expenses, during the first quarter of 2012 and
the maturity of short-term investments of $25.5 million during 2012. Also, cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was $175.3 million. These increases were partially offset by capital expenditures of $68.2 million and the repurchase of
the redeemable noncontrolling interest of $55.4 million and payment of a special dividend of $33.4 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter of 2013 will be reduced by cash payments for corporation taxes in Germany which we expect to be more
than $30.0 million. This payment primarily relates to taxes for fiscal year 2011 which became payable after we completed our 2011 German tax filing during the fourth quarter of 2012.



Our long-term debt consists primarily of a $14.0 million secured variable-rate note, of
which the current portion is $1.4 million as of December 31, 2012. The note matures in June 2015, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $10.7 million. The variable interest rate was fixed by means of interest rate
swap instruments. In January 2011, we entered into a 10-year Euro 1.4 million ($1.9 million) mortgage obligation to fund the purchase of a new building in Italy, of which the current portion is $0.1 million as of
December 31, 2012. The interest on this mortgage obligation is fixed at 4.96% and it amortizes in full over the term of the obligation.

In June 2012, our German subsidiary entered into a new credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG (the “Euro Credit Facility”) to replace the prior credit facility that expired on June 30, 2012.
The Euro Credit Facility makes available Euro 20.0 million ($26.4 million) and will expire on June 30, 2014.

We
expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future long-term capital requirements
depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of economic recessions on our sales levels, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and
introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. We have made no arrangements to obtain additional financing, and there is no assurance that such
additional financing, if required or desired, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

The
following table details our line-of-credit facilities as of December 31, 2012:

(1)

$14.1 million of this credit facility is available to our foreign subsidiaries including those in India, China, Japan and South Korea. Total drawings at
December 31, 2012 were $0.4 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.3%.

(2)

$17.2 million of this credit facility is available to our German subsidiary, $4.0 million is available to our Russian subsidiary and $5.2 million is available
to our Italian subsidiary.

Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America and Deutsche Bank in the
amounts of $35.0 million and $26.4 million, respectively, and neither of them is syndicated.

We are required to meet certain
financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facilities. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest
payments during the period. Cash



flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than
two times our trailing twelve-month EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.

The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not take or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we
can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in
available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2010 and June
2011, we sold an aggregate 22.5% minority interest (the “Minority Interest”) of our Russian subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus (“NTO”), to the Russian Corporation for Nanotechnologies (“Rusnano”) for an aggregate of $45.0
million. In addition, we had a call option commencing in December 2013 to buy back the Minority Interest at a predetermined value and Rusnano had a warrant to purchase an additional 2.5% interest in NTO and a put option commencing in December 2015
to sell its Minority Interest to us at a predetermined value. On June 29, 2012, we repurchased the Minority Interest for $55.4 million in cash and, under the terms of the agreement, the warrant and the put and call options were terminated. Due
to the put rights, the Minority Interest was reported as a liability other than permanent equity under ASC 480-10-S99-3A. Based upon our valuation of the Minority Interest, the amount paid to repurchase the Minority Interest did not exceed its fair
value. Accordingly, pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99-3A, we recorded the amount paid in excess of carrying amount in additional paid-in capital. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $87.9 million to
$175.3 million in 2012 from $87.4 million in 2011, primarily resulting from:

•

An increase in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges of $41.3 million in 2012 as compared to $76.4 million in 2011
primarily related to an increase in net income;

•

An increase in inventory of $23.0 million in 2012 compared to an increase of inventory of $56.1 million in 2011;

•

A decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.2 million in 2012 compared to a decrease of $6.8 million in 2011; and

•

An increase in accounts receivable of $22.7 million in 2012 compared to an increase of $23.7 million in 2011.

Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming testing procedures for both internally manufactured and externally purchased
components and the lead time required to manufacture components used in our finished products, the rate at which we turn inventory historically has been low when compared to our cost of sales. Also, our historical growth rates require investment in
inventories to support future sales and enable us to quote short delivery times to our customers, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there is a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key
technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to continue to build finished products for a reasonable period of time. We believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As
a result, we expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean that the rate at which we are able to
convert our inventory into cash would decrease.

Deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a
foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction. Historically, we have reinvested the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to continue to do this and keep such earnings
indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions.



Investing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities
was $55.3 million and $79.1 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2012 related to the construction of new buildings in the United States, Germany and Russia as well as purchases of machinery and
equipment and $11.6 million for the purchase of a laser micro-systems company during the third quarter of 2012. These expenditures were partially offset by the proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments of $25.5 million. In 2011, cash
used in investing activities was related to the purchase of new buildings in Germany and Japan, the start of the construction of new buildings in Russia and purchases of machinery and equipment.

We expect to incur between $60 million to $70 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, in 2013. The timing and extent of
any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flows. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period.

Financing activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $82.1 million and
$31.9 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was primarily related to the follow-on public stock offering for which we received $167.9 million, net of offering expenses. To a lesser extent, in
2012, cash was provided from stock option exercises and stock sales under our employee stock purchase plan. These were partially offset by the repurchase of a 22.5% redeemable noncontrolling interest in our Russian subsidiary of $55.4 million and a
special dividend of $33.4 million to stockholders of record in December 2012. The cash provided by financing activities in 2011 was primarily related to cash received from Rusnano for a 10% interest in our Russian subsidiary and cash provided by the
exercise of stock options and stock sales under our employee stock purchase plan.

Contractual Obligations

The following table describes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands).

(1)

Interest for long-term debt obligations was calculated including the effect of our interest rate swaps. The effect of the interest rate swaps, which are accounted for
as a cash flow hedge, are to fix the LIBOR component of the interest rate of the underlying floating rate loan at 4.1% and 2.6% for the term of the debt.

(2)

Excludes obligations related to ASC 740 because we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the remainder of these
obligations. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220):
Presentation of Comprehensive Income”, which amended the current comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’
equity. Instead, we must report comprehensive



income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements. We
adopted ASU 2011-05 in the first quarter of 2012. This adoption did not have an impact on our statement of financial condition as it only required a change in the ordering of our financial statements.

The FASB subsequently issued ASU No. 2011-12, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments
to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05”. The amendments to the Codification in ASU No. 2011-12 became effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU
No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income, so that entities are not required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 deferred. Entities should continue to report reclassifications out of
accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05. All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-5 were not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report
comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.

Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption
until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash
and cash equivalents and our debt and foreign exchange rate risk.

Interest rate risk.

Our
investments have limited exposure to market risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting primarily of bank deposits, money market funds and short-term government funds. The
interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations.

Our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense
we must pay on our bank debt and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. The interest rate on our existing bank debt is effectively fixed except for our U.S. revolving line of credit. The rates on our Euro overdraft facilities in Germany and
Italy and our Japanese Yen overdraft facility are fixed for twelve-month periods. Approximately 63% of our outstanding debt had a fixed rate of interest as of December 31, 2012. We do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Exchange rates.

Due
to our international operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan and the Russian Ruble.
As a result, our international operations give rise to transactional market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese Yuan and the Russian Ruble. Losses and gains on foreign exchange
transactions totaled a $1.4 million loss in 2012 and a $2.9 million gain in 2011. Management believes that the use of foreign currency financial instruments reduces the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these instruments
provide only limited protection. We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in additional financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential
fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future. No foreign currency derivative instruments were outstanding at December 31, 2012.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer
and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

Management’s Annual
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company and its subsidiaries. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited our internal control over financial
reporting, as stated in their report below.

Changes in Internal Controls

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management (including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of fraud, if any, within the company
have been or will be detected.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, MA

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the
“Company”) as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

IPG Photonics Corporation

Oxford, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

1.

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Business

— IPG Photonics Corporation (the “Company”) is the leading developer and
manufacturer of a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing. Its world headquarters are located in Oxford, Massachusetts. It also has
facilities and sales offices elsewhere in the United States, Europe and Asia.

Principles of Consolidation

— The
Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1998. The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

— The financial information for entities outside the United States
is measured using local currencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates. Income and expenses are translated into
U.S. dollars based on the average rate of exchange for the corresponding period. Exchange rate differences resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for directly as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

— Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly
liquid investments, such as bank deposits, marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less with insignificant interest rate risk and marketable securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of
acquisition. Short-term investments consisted primarily of similar highly liquid investments, such as bank deposits and marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than three months.

Inventories

— Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories include parts
and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence. The Company periodically reviews the quantities and carrying values of inventories to assess whether the inventories are recoverable. Because of the Company’s
vertical integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales activity could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation. The costs associated with provisions for excess quantities, technological
obsolescence, or component rejections are charged to cost of sales as incurred.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. In the case of leasehold improvements, the
estimated useful lives of the related assets do not exceed the remaining terms of the corresponding leases. The following table presents the assigned economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment:

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations. Interest expense
associated with significant capital projects is capitalized as a cost of the project. The Company capitalized $142, $46 and $18 of interest expense in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Long-Lived Assets

— Long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, are reviewed by management
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In cases in which undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded equal to
the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. No impairment losses have been recorded during the periods presented.

Included in other long-term assets is certain demonstration equipment. The demonstration equipment is amortized over the respective estimated economic lives, generally 3 years. The carrying value of
the demonstration equipment totaled $4,931 and $3,799 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Amortization expense of demonstration equipment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $2,797, $2,920 and $3,690,
respectively.

Goodwill —

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business
acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“FASB ASC 350”). Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded
goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an
impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.

Intangible Assets

— Intangible assets result from
the Company’s various business acquisitions. Intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized on a straight-line basis either over their estimated useful lives of five to ten years or over the period
the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.

Revenue Recognition

— The Company recognizes revenue
in accordance with FASB ASC 605. Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. These separate units generally consist of equipment and installation. The consideration for
the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices. The selling price of equipment is based on vendor-specific objective evidence and the selling price of installation is based on third-party
evidence. Applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied separately for each separate unit of accounting. Equipment revenue generally is recognized upon the transfer of ownership which is typically at the time of shipment. Installation revenue
is recognized upon completion of the installation service, which typically occurs within 30 to 90 days of delivery. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Rights of return generally are not
included in sales arrangements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of outstanding receivables.

F-9


IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

Warranties

— In general, the Company’s products carry a warranty against defect for a
period of one to three years, depending upon the product type and customer negotiations. The expected cost associated with these warranty obligations is recorded when the revenue is recognized. The warranty accrual is reflected in accrued expenses
and other liabilities and in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Activity related to the warranty accrual was as follows:

Accrued warranty reported in the accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011
consists of $7,838 and $6,186, respectively, in accrued expenses and other liabilities and $2,876 and $2,445, respectively, in other long-term liabilities.

Advertising Expense

— The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. The Company conducts substantially all of its sales and marketing efforts through trade shows, professional and technical
conferences, direct sales and our website. The Company’s advertising costs were not material for the periods presented.

Research and Development

— Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards and credits using enacted rates in effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided
against deferred tax assets that are not deemed to be recoverable. The Company recognizes tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The tax positions are measured at the greatest amount
of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company provides
reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. The reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by it in its tax filings or positions is
more likely than not to be realized following resolution of uncertainties related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of
cash and cash equivalents, auction rate securities and accounts receivable. The Company

F-10


IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

maintains substantially all of its cash and marketable securities in six financial institutions, which it believes to be high-credit quality financial institutions. The Company grants credit to
customers in the ordinary course of business and provide a reserve for potential credit losses. Such losses historically have been within management’s expectations (see discussion related to significant customers in Note 15).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, auction rate securities, accounts payable, drawings on revolving lines of credit, long-term debt and certain derivative instruments.

The valuation techniques used to measure fair value are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs
reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs
other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
assumptions.

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and drawings on revolving lines
of credit are considered reasonable estimates of their fair market value, due to the short maturity of these instruments or as a result of the competitive market interest rates, which have been negotiated.

The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value:

F-11


IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Money market funds, treasury bills and time deposits are included in cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments and auction rate securities are included in other assets.

The interest rate swaps are designated as
cash flow hedges the fair value of which was estimated based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Fair value at December 31, 2012 and 2011 for the auction rate securities considered prices observed in inactive
secondary markets for the securities held by the Company.

On August 31, 2012, the Company acquired the working capital
and long-term assets of JP Sercel Associates, Inc. In addition to cash paid, consideration includes contingent consideration based on sales targets that extend for two one-year periods that became effective October 1, 2012. Total possible
additional payouts under these earn-outs are $18,500. The Company has accrued a liability of $2,452 related to these contingencies. The fair value of the accrued contingent consideration incurred was determined using an income approach at the
acquisition date and reporting date. That approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include assessing the probability of meeting certain milestones required to earn the contingent consideration.

The Company completed the acquisition of Multilane Technology through its Italian subsidiary during 2011, and the
acquisitions of Photonics Innovations, Inc., and Cosytronic, KG during 2010. The fair value of the accrued contingent consideration incurred during these acquisitions was determined using an income approach at the acquisition date and reporting
date. That approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include assessing the probability of meeting certain milestones required to earn the contingent consideration. As of December 31, 2012,
the Company has accrued a liability of $571 for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration expected to be payable upon the acquired companies reaching specific performance metrics over the next four years of operation. As of
December 31, 2012, the ranges of outcomes and key assumptions have not changed materially.

As of December 31, 2012,
the ranges of outcomes and key assumptions have not changed materially. Auction rate securities and contingent consideration are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The fair value of the
auction rate securities was determined using prices observed in inactive secondary markets for the securities held by the Company. The fair value of the accrued contingent consideration incurred was determined using an income approach at the
acquisition date and

reporting date. That approach is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include assessing the probability of meeting certain milestones required to
earn the contingent consideration.

The auction rate securities are considered available-for-sale securities. They had a cost
basis of $1,450 at December 31, 2012 and 2011. Other-than-temporary impairments recorded in other (expense) income, net were $0, $49 and $338 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company terminated the warrant held by Rusnano as part of the redemption of
Rusnano’s redeemable noncontrolling interest.

Comprehensive Income

— Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to equity that are
not the result of transactions with stockholders. Included within comprehensive income is the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment and unrealized gains or losses on derivatives. These adjustments are accumulated within the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income.

Total components of accumulated other comprehensive loss were as follows:

F-13


IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

Derivative Instruments

— The Company’s primary market exposures are to
interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company may use certain derivative financial instruments to help manage these exposures. The Company executes these instruments with financial institutions it judges to be credit-worthy. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company recognizes all
derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has used foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted intercompany settlements denominated in
foreign currencies of major industrial countries. The Company has no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has interest rate swaps that are classified as a cash flow hedge of its variable rate debt. The Company has no
derivatives that are not accounted for as a hedging instrument.

Cash Flow Hedges

— The Company’s cash flow
hedges consist of interest rate swaps under which it agrees to pay fixed rates of interest. All of the Company’s derivatives are accounted for as hedging instruments. The fair value amounts in the consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, were:

(1)

Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding.

The derivative gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
related to the Company’s interest rate swap contracts were as follows:

The Company made no adjustments to the fair value of this derivative as a result of evaluating
counterparty risk.

Business Segment Information

— The Company operates in one segment which involves the design,
development, production and distribution of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and related optical components. The Company has a single, company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than as discrete operating segments.
The chief decision maker, who is the Company’s chief executive officer, measures

F-14


IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

financial performance as a single enterprise and not on legal entity or end-market basis. Throughout the year, the chief decision maker allocates capital resources on a project-by-project basis
across the Company’s entire asset base to maximize profitability without regard to legal entity or end-market basis. The Company operates in a number of countries throughout the world in a variety of product lines. Information regarding
geographic financial information and product lines is provided in Note 15.

Earnings Per Share

— The Company computes net
income per share in accordance with ASC 260—Earnings Per Share. Under the provisions of ASC 260, basic net income per share is computed by dividing the net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share adjusts basic net income per common share for the effects of stock options and restricted stock units only in periods in which such effect is dilutive. ASC 260 also requires the
Company to present basic and diluted earnings per share information separately for each class of equity instruments that participate in any income distribution with primary equity instruments. The Company calculates earnings per share in periods
where a class of common stock was redeemable for other than fair value through the application of the two-class method. The computation of net income per share is provided in Note 9.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

— In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income (Topic
220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income,” which amended the comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’
equity. Instead, the Company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements. The
Company adopted ASU 2011-05 in the first quarter of 2012. This adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as it only required a change in the ordering of its financial statements.

The FASB subsequently issued ASU No. 2011-12, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments
to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No. 2011-05.” The amendments to the Codification in ASU No. 2011-12 became effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU
No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income, so that entities are not required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU No. 2011-05 that ASU No. 2011-12 deferred. Entities should continue to report reclassifications out of
accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before ASU No. 2011-05. All other requirements in ASU No. 2011-5 were not affected by ASU No. 2011-12, including the requirement to report
comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements.

Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption
until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements upon adoption.

Subsequent Events

— The Company has considered the impact of subsequent events through the filing date of these financial
statements.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock-based compensation is included in the following financial statement captions:

Compensation cost for all share-based payment awards is based on the estimated grant-date fair value. The
Company allocates and records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

The Company calculates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the appropriate
fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in
calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses
different assumptions, its stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model or the calculation of compensation were as follows for the years ended
December 31.

Incentive Plans

— In April 2000, the Company’s board of directors adopted the 2000
Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2000 Plan”), and in February 2006, the Company’s board of directors adopted the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2006 Plan”), which provide for the issuance of stock options and other
stock and non-stock based awards to the Company’s directors, employees, consultants and advisors. The Company reserved 5,833,333 shares under the 2000 Plan and 4,000,000 shares under the 2006 Plan for the issuance of awards under the
plans. During 2011, the Company reserved an additional 6,084,273 shares under the 2006 Plan. In June 2006, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the “Directors Plan”). Only non-employee
directors are eligible to receive awards under the Directors Plan. The Company reserved 486,660 shares for issuance under the Directors Plan. Under the three plans, the Company may grant nonstatutory stock options at an exercise price at least
equal to the fair value of its common stock on the date of grant, unless the board of directors or compensation committee determines otherwise on the date of grant. Incentive stock options may be granted under the 2000 Plan and the 2006 Plan at
exercise prices equal to or exceeding the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. The Company may also grant restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards. Incentive awards generally become exercisable over
periods

F-16


IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

of one to five years and expire seven to ten years from the date of the grant. The awards under the 2000 Plan and the 2006 Plan may become exercisable earlier upon the occurrence of certain
change of control events at the election of the board of directors or compensation committee, and all awards under the Directors Plan automatically become exercisable upon a change of control. All shares issued under the stock option plans are
registered shares newly issued by the Company. At December 31, 2012, options to purchase 6,465,903 shares of the Company’s stock were available for future grant under the three option plans.

A summary of option activity, including the employee stock purchase plan, is presented below (see Note 11 for further information):

The intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010, was $20,792, $29,265 and $13,431, respectively.

The weighted-average grant fair value for options granted during the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, was $26.80, $27.60 and $7.66, respectively.

The total compensation cost
related to nonvested awards not yet recorded at December 31, 2012 was $21,553 which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of 3.2 years.

The fair value of awards vested during the year ended December 31, 2012 was $5,511.

INVENTORIES

Inventories consist of the following:

(In thousands, except share and per share data)

The Company recorded inventory provisions to cost of sales totaling $8,232, $6,139 and
$2,745 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These provisions were recorded as a result of uncertainties related to the recoverability of the value of inventories due to technological changes and excess quantities. These provisions are reported as a
reduction to components and raw materials and finished goods.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant, and equipment consist of the following:

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $21,108, $18,796 and $16,212 in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

(approximately $1,100 at December 31, 2012) that does not have an expiration date. This facility bears interest at market rates that vary depending upon the bank within the syndicate that advances the principal outstanding (6.5% at
December 31, 2012). At December 31, 2012, the aggregate remaining availability under these lines was approximately $1,100. This facility is collateralized by a common pool of the assets of the Company’s German subsidiary, IPG Laser
GmbH.

Term Debt:

U.S. Long-Term Note

— In 2010, the Company extended the maturity of the U.S Long-Term Note from August 2013 to June 2015. Outstanding principal under the U.S. Long-Term Note bears
interest at LIBOR plus 0.9% to 1.3%, depending on certain financial ratios and requires monthly principal payments of $111 and interest through June 2015, at which time the remaining principal is payable. This note is collateralized by a mortgage on
the real estate and building in Massachusetts, housing its U.S. operations. The Company entered into an interest rate swap instrument which converts the variable LIBOR rate on the original term note to a fixed rate of 5.0%. For the extended
term from August 2013 to June 2015, the Company entered into a separate interest rate swap instrument which converts the variable LIBOR rate to a fixed rate of 3.47%. Changes in fair value of the swaps are included in “Accumulated Other
Comprehensive income (loss)” on the consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized loss on the swap will be recognized into income over the term of the swap as a charge to interest expense.

The Company’s existing borrowings under financing arrangements consist of the following:

The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants associated with its U.S.
Line of Credit and U.S. Long-Term Note. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio. The debt service
coverage covenant requires it to maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA
less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis shall be less than two times the Company’s trailing twelve months EBITDA.

REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests —

Redeemable noncontrolling interests reported in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements related to a 22.5% minority interest of the Company’s Russian subsidiary, NTO IRE-Polus (“NTO”), as of December 31, 2011 and through June 29, 2012, respectively.

In December 2010 and June 2011, the Company sold an aggregate 22.5% minority interest (the “Minority Interest”) of NTO to the
Russian Corporation for Nanotechnologies (“Rusnano”) for $45,000. In addition, the Company had a call option commencing in December 2013 to buy back the Minority Interest at a predetermined value and Rusnano had a warrant to purchase an
additional 2.5% interest in NTO and a put option commencing in December 2015 to sell its Minority Interest to the Company at a predetermined value. On June 29, 2012, the Company repurchased the Minority Interest for $55,400 in cash. Under the
terms of the agreement, the warrant and the put and call options were terminated. Due to the put rights, the Minority Interest repurchase has been reported as a liability other than permanent equity under ASC 480-10-S99-3A. Based upon the
Company’s valuation of the Minority Interest, the amount paid to repurchase the Minority Interest did not exceed its fair value. Accordingly, pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99-3A, the Company recorded the amount paid in excess of carrying amount in
additional paid-in capital.

The following is a reconciliation of the reported amounts of redeemable noncontrolling interest
in the accompanying balance sheets as of December 31, 2012:

A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax
rate to the recorded tax provision for the years ended December 31, is as follows:

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, are as follows:

In general, it is the Company’s practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries in those operations. Accordingly, it has not made any provision for additional U.S. or foreign withholding taxes with respect to repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the cumulative
unremitted earnings that are reinvested in non-U.S. subsidiaries are approximately $283,000 and $122,000, respectively.

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax
benefits:

Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and the
Company’s effective tax rate in the future. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Act”) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. Because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment, certain provisions
of the Act benefiting the Company’s 2012 U.S. federal taxes, including the research and experimentation credit, cannot be recognized in the Company’s 2012 financial results and instead will be reflected in its 2013 financial results. The
Company estimates that a benefit of approximately $800 will be accounted for as a discrete item in its tax provision for the first quarter of 2013. In addition, the Company expects that the Act’s extension of these provisions through the end of
2013 will favorably affect its estimated annual effective tax rate for 2013 by approximately 0.4 percentage points as compared to 2012.

Estimated penalties and interest related to the underpayment of income taxes are $352, $133 and $4 for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included within the
provision for income taxes. Total accrued penalties and interest related to the underpayment of income taxes are $487 and $275 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Company’s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxing
authorities. If realized, all of the Company’s uncertain tax positions would affect its effective tax rate. None of the uncertain tax positions are expected to settle within one year. Open tax years by major jurisdictions are:

•     United States

2002 — 2012

•     Germany

2009 — 2012

•     Russia

2009 — 2012
