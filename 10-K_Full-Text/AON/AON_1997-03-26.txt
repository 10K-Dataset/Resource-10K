subsidiaries,   is   well-positioned   to  serve  this  market.  Aon  Consulting
subsidiaries offer services to clients including  organizational analysis and HR
strategic  planning,  recruitment and selection,  benefits design and management
training and development. Benefits issues in foreign countries are becoming more
complicated, and Aon Holdings and Aon Consulting anticipate increased demand for
their services in these markets.

acquisitions  of A&A and Bain Hogg, Aon Re is a global leader in the reinsurance
and specialist  brokerage  industry.  Aon Re serves the alternative  market with

(2) INSURANCE UNDERWRITING


     Combined Insurance Company of America ("Combined Insurance"); Combined Life
Insurance Company of New York ("CLICNY");Virginia  Surety Company, Inc. ("VSC");
London General Insurance  Company Limited ("London  General") and Aon Warranty
Group,Inc.("Aon Warranty").

     In April 1996,  the Registrant and Combined  Insurance  Combined  Insurance
completed  the sales of Combined  Insurance's  direct  response  life and health
subsidiary,  Union  Fidelity  Life  Insurance  Company  ("UFLIC"),  and Combined
Insurance's  capital  accumulation  insurance  subsidiary,  The  Life  Insurance
Company of Virginia ("LOV").

     The Registrant's insurance  underwriting  subsidiaries are part of a highly
competitive industry that serves individual consumers in North America,  Europe,
Latin  America and the Pacific  by  providing  accident  and health  coverage,
traditional life insurance and, extended warranties through global  distribution
networks  that  are  directly  owned  by the  Registrant's subsidiaries.

     The accident and health  distribution  network  encompasses  primarily  the
agents  of  Combined  Insurance.  With more  than  five  million  policyholders,
Combined  Insurance has more  individual  accident and health  policies in force
than any other United  States  company.  Combined  Insurance,  the  Registrant's
principal  accident  and health  insurer,  has a direct  sales  force of several
thousand  career  agents  calling on  individuals  to sell a broad  spectrum  of
accident and health  products.  It is one of the few companies  with agents that
call on  customers  every six months to renew  coverage  and to sell  additional
coverage.   Combined   Insurance  offers  a  wide  range  of  accident-only  and
sickness-only insurance products,  including short-term disability,  cancer aid,
Medicare  supplement  and  disability  income  coverage.   Combined  Insurance's
products  are  primarily  fixed  indemnity  obligations,  thereby not subject to
escalating medical costs.  Combined  Insurance offers a simplified  accident and
sickness long-term disability policy. In addition,  to its traditional business,
Combined  Insurance  is  expanding  its  product  distribution  through  payroll
deduction, worksite marketing programs.

     Combined  Insurance and its wholly-owned  subsidiary CLICNY (which operates
exclusively in the State of New York) market whole life products  through direct
sales career agents in the United States.  Combined  Insurance  ranked among the
top 100 life  insurance  companies  in the United  States in terms of total life
premiums in 1995. Life insurance  business is conducted by the Registrant's life
insurance  subsidiaries  in the  United  States,  Canada, Ireland, Germany, and
New Zealand.

     The  Registrant's  extended  warranty  and  specialty  insurance  business,
conducted by subsidiaries VSC in North America and London General in Europe,  is
composed  primarily  of  extended  warranty  insurance  products,   professional
liability  insurance  coverages,  workers'  compensation and specialty financial
institution coverages.  VSC and London General continue to be one of the world's
largest  underwriters of consumer extended  warranties.  The automobile warranty
products are sold in the United States,  Canada,  the United  Kingdom,  Ireland,
France,  The Netherlands,  Belgium,  Spain and Japan. Aon Warranty Group handles
the  administration  of  certain  extended  warranty  products  on  automobiles,
electronic goods,  personal computers and appliances.  It serves  manufacturers,
distributors  and retailers of major  worldwide  consumer  product and financial
institutions, associations and affinity groups in North America and Europe.

credit underwriting and distribution  operations,  including the distribution of
auto  extended  warranties  throughout  North  America.  The  extended  warranty
products will continue to be underwritten by VSC.

(3) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     The Life  Insurance  Company of Virginia  ("LOV") and Union  Fidelity  Life
Insurance Company ("UFLIC").

     In April 1996, the Registrant and Combined Insurance completed the sales of
Combined  Insurance's  subsidiaries,  LOV and UFLIC. The business written by LOV
primarily included capital  accumulation  products and some other life products.
UFLIC operated in the United States in the highly  competitive  direct  response
life and health marketing segment of the industry.

LICENSING AND REGULATION

     Insurance   companies  must  comply  with  laws  and   regulations  of  the
jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are designed
to ensure  financial  solvency of  insurance  companies  and to require fair and
adequate  service and  treatment  for  policyholders.  They are  enforced by the
states in the United States, by industry  self-regulating agencies in the United
Kingdom,  and by various  regulatory  agencies  in other  countries  through the
granting  and  revoking  of  licenses  to  do  business,  licensing  of  agents,
monitoring  of  trade  practices,  policy  form  approval,  minimum  loss  ratio
requirements,  limits on premium and commission  rates,  and minimum reserve and
capital requirements. Compliance is monitored by the state insurance departments
through periodic regulatory reporting procedures and periodic examinations.  The
quarterly and annual  financial  reports to the  regulators in the United States
utilize  accounting  principles which are different from the generally  accepted
accounting  principles used in stockholders'  reports.  The statutory accounting
principles,   in  keeping   with  the  intent  to  assure  the   protection   of
policyholders,  are based, in general,  on a liquidation concept while generally
accepted accounting principles are based on a going-concern concept.

     The state insurance  regulators are members of the National  Association of
Insurance  Commissioners  ("NAIC"). This Association seeks to promote uniformity
of, and to enhance the state  regulation  of,  insurance.  Both the NAIC and the
individual states continue to focus on the solvency of insurance companies. This
focus is reflected in additional regulatory oversight by the states and emphasis
on the  enactment  or  adoption  of a series of NAIC model laws and  regulations
designed to promote solvency. The increase in any solvency-related  oversight by
the  states is not  expected  to have any  significant  impact on the  insurance
business of the Registrant.

     Several  years ago,  the NAIC  developed a formula for  analyzing  insurers
called  risk-based  capital  ("RBC").  RBC is  intended to  establish  "minimum"
capital  threshold  levels  that  vary  with  the  size  and mix of a  company's
business.  It is designed to identify companies with the capital levels that may
require  regulatory  attention.  RBC does not have any significant impact on the
insurance business of the Registrant.

     Insurance  companies are generally not subject to any federal regulation of
their  insurance  business  because of the  existence  of a federal law commonly
known as the  McCarran-Ferguson  Act.  McCarran-Ferguson  provides the insurance
industry with immunity from certain  aspects of the federal  anti-trust  law and
exempts the business of insurance from federal  regulation.  In the past several
years  there have been a number of  recommendations  that  McCarran-Ferguson  be
repealed entirely or modified to remove the industry's  anti-trust exemption and
subject it to federal regulation.  If  McCarran-Ferguson  were to be repealed or
modified,  state regulation of the insurance business would continue. The result
could be an additional layer of federal regulation.  The Registrant expects that
any  repeal  of   anti-trust   exemptions   available  to  insurers   under  the
McCarran-Ferguson Act would not have a significant impact on its operations.


                                     - 5 -



     The state  insurance  holding  company  laws  require  prior  notice to and
approval of the domestic state insurance department of intracorporate  transfers
of assets  within  the  holding  company  structure,  including  the  payment of
dividends  by  insurance  company  subsidiaries.  In  addition, the premium
finance  loans by  Cananwill,  Inc., an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of the
Registrant, are subject to one or more of  truth-in-lending  and credit
regulations,  insurance  premium finance acts, retail installment sales acts and
other similar consumer protection legislation. Failure to comply  with such laws
or  regulations  can  result in the  temporary suspension or permanent  loss of
the right to engage in business in a particular jurisdiction as well as other
penalties.

     Regulatory authorities in the states in which the operating subsidiaries of
Aon Group conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as
brokers,   agents,   third  party   administrators,   managing  general  agents,
reinsurance  intermediaries  or  adjusters.  Under  the  laws  of  most  states,
regulatory   authorities  have  relatively  broad  discretion  with  respect  to
granting,  renewing  and  revoking  brokers'  and  agents'  licenses to transact
business in the state.  The manner of  operating in  particular  states may vary
according to the  licensing  requirements  of the  particular  state,  which may
require,  among other  things,  that a firm operate in the state through a local
corporation.  In a few states,  licenses are issued only to individual residents
or locally-owned  business entities.  In such cases, Aon Group subsidiaries have
arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the state.

In 1996 the federal Health Care Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act of
1996 was enacted.  The Act  requires the states to take action to implement  the
requirements  of  the  Act  or to  become  subject  to  federal  oversight.  The
Registrant  does not  believe  tht the  state  action  required  by the Act will
materially  affect the business of the Registrant's  subsidiaries.  In addition,
federal laws mandating specific prectices by medical insurers have recently been
enacted from which,  because of the nature of the  business of the  Registrant's
subsidiaries, the Registrant's subsidiaries are exempt. Numerous states have had
legislation introduced to reform the health care system and such legislation has
passed in several states.  While it is impossible to forecast the precise nature
of future  state health care  changes,  the  Registrant  does not expect a major
impact  on its  operations  because  of the  supplemental  nature of most of the
policies  issued by its  insurance  subsidiaries  and because the  coverages are
primarily purchased to provide, on a fixed-indemnity  basis,  protection against
loss-of-time or disability benefits.  If health care reform does not provide for
a significant  role for insurance  companies  currently  writing primary medical
coverage,  the Registrant  expects that some of those  companies  would increase
their  participation in other segments of the insurance  underwriting  business,
perhaps heightening the competition with Combined Insurance.  Combined Insurance
and its subsidiaries currently operate successfully in several foreign countries
which have national health plans in effect.


Clientele

     No significant  part of the Registrant's or its  subsidiaries'  business is
dependent upon a single client or on a few clients, the loss of any one of which
would have a material adverse effect on the Registrant.


Employees

     The Registrant's subsidiaries had approximately 28,000 employees at the end
of 1996 of whom  approximately  three-fourths  are salaried and hourly employees
and the  remaining  one-fourth  are  sales  representatives  who  are  generally
compensated wholly or primarily by commission.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

     The  Registrant's  subsidiaries  own and occupy  office  buildings in eight
states and certain  foreign  countries,  and lease office space elsewhere in the
United  States and in various  foreign  cities.  Loss of the use of any owned or
leased property, while potentially disruptive,  would have no material impact on
the Registrant.

Consolidated Financial Statements on page 40 of the Annual Report.



ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     None.

                                 Aon Corporation
                                (Parent Company)
                     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.   See notes to consolidated  financial  statements  incorporated by reference
     from the Annual  Report.


2.   Cash and cash equivalents on the condensed statements of financial position
     include short-term investments.

3.   Payments made as  assessments  by state  guaranty  funds to cover losses to
     policyholders of insurance  companies under regulatory  supervision for the
     years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $1.4 million,  $5 million
     and  $6.9  million,  respectively.  In  addition,  Aon's  reserve  for  the
     recognition of probable  assessments for known industry insolvencies was $0
     million and $7 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

4.   Generally,  the net assets of Aon's  insurance  subsidiaries  available for
     transfer  to the  parent  company  are  limited  to the  amounts  that  the
     insurance  subsidiaries'  statutory  net assets  exceed  minimum  statutory
     capital  requirements;  however,  payment of the  amounts as  dividends  in
     excess  of  $987   million  may  be  subject  to  approval  by   regulatory
     authorities.

5.   Subsequent Event
     On March 21, 1997,  Aon's  directors  approved a three-for-two stock split,
     payable on May 14, 1997 in the form of a stock dividend of one common share
     for every two shares  held,  to  stockholders  of record as of the close of
     business on May 1, 1997. Because the stock split was approved subsequent to
     the distribution of Aon's 1996 Annual Report to Stockholders, references to
     common  stock  and  earnings  per  share  data  in  the  Annual  Report  to
     Stockholders  and in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  have  not  been
     retroactively  adjusted.  Retroactively  adjusting such information to give
     effect to the stock  split for  1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively,  would
     result in net income per share of $1.91,  $2.32 and $2.09 and dividends per
     share of $0.95, $0.89 and $0.84.

                     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(6)  Below is a reconciliation of the combined  statutory  stockholders'  equity
     and  net  income  of  Aon's  insurance  subsidiaries  to  the  consolidated
     stockholders' equity and net income on a basis in accordance with generally
     accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
