PART I

Item 1.    Business.

OVERVIEW

Aon Corporation (which may be referred to as "Aon," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") provides risk management and human capital
consulting services, delivering distinctive client value via innovative and effective risk management solutions, including insurance and reinsurance brokerage and workforce productivity solutions.
Aon's technical expertise is delivered locally through colleagues worldwide.

We
serve clients through the following businesses:

•

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services

business acts as an advisor and
insurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, as well as negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

•

Consulting

business provides advice and services to clients related to
health and benefits, retirement, compensation, strategic human capital, and human resource outsourcing.

Our
clients include corporations and businesses, insurance companies, professional organizations, independent agents and brokers, governments, and other entities. We also serve
individuals through personal lines, affinity groups, and certain specialty operations.

In
November 2008, we expanded our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services product offerings through the merger with Benfield Group Limited ("Benfield"), a leading independent reinsurance
intermediary. Benfield products have been integrated with our existing reinsurance products.

In
April 2008, we completed the sale of our Combined Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Sterling Insurance Company ("Sterling") subsidiaries, which represented the majority of the
operations of our former Insurance Underwriting segment. In August 2009, we completed the sale of our remaining property and casualty insurance underwriting operations that were in
run-off. The results of all of these operations are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Aon
was incorporated in 1979 under the laws of Delaware, and is the parent corporation of both long-established and acquired companies. We have approximately 36,200 employees
and conduct our operations through various subsidiaries in more than 120 countries and sovereignties.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services Segment

The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment generated approximately 83% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009, and has
approximately 28,800 employees worldwide. We provide risk and insurance brokerage and related services in this segment primarily through our Aon Risk Services and Aon Benfield companies.

Principal Products and Services

We operate in this segment through two product lines: retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage.

Retail brokerage

encompasses our retail brokerage services, affinity products, managing general underwriting, placement, and captive
management services. The Americas' operations provide products and services to clients in North, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. Our United Kingdom; Europe, Middle East &
Africa; and Asia Pacific operations offer similar products and services to clients throughout the rest of the world.


Our
employees draw upon our global network of resources, industry-leading data and analytics, and specialized expertise to deliver value to clients ranging from small and
mid-sized businesses to multi-national corporations as well as individuals in need of personal coverage. We work with clients to identify their business needs and help them assess and
understand their total cost of risk. Once we have gained an understanding of our client's risk management needs, we are able to leverage our global network and implement a customized risk approach
with local Aon resources. The outcome is a comprehensive risk solution provided locally and personally. The "Client Promise" enables our colleagues around the globe to describe, benchmark and price
the value we deliver to clients in a unified approach, based on the ten most important criteria that our clients believe are critical to managing their total cost of risk.

Knowledge
and foresight, unparalleled benchmarking and carrier knowledge are the qualities at the heart of our professional services excellence. With advanced technology such as our
Global Risk Insight
Platform

SM

, we are uniquely positioned to provide clients with insights into market conditions, premium rates and best practices in program design, across all industries and economic
centers.

As
a retail broker, we serve as an advisor to clients and facilitate a wide spectrum of risk management solutions for property liability, general liability, professional and directors'
and officers' liability, workers' compensation, and additional exposures. Our business is comprised of several specialty areas structured around specific product and industry needs.

We
deliver specialized advice and services in such industries as technology, financial services, agribusiness, aviation, construction, health care and energy, among others. Through our
global Affinity business, we provide products for professional liability, life, disability income and personal lines for individuals, associations and businesses around the world.

In
addition, we are a major provider of risk consulting services, including captive management, that provide our clients with alternative vehicles for managing risks that would be
cost-prohibitive or unavailable in traditional insurance markets.

Finally,
our eSolutions products enable clients to manage risks, policies, claims and safety concerns efficiently through an integrated technology platform.

Reinsurance brokerage

offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that enhance the risk/return
characteristics of insurance policy portfolios, improve capital utilization, and evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide. An insurance or reinsurance company may seek reinsurance
or other risk-transfer solutions on all or a portion of the risks it insures. To accomplish this, our reinsurance brokerage services use dynamic financial analysis and capital market
alternatives, such as transferring catastrophe risk through securitization. Reinsurance brokerage also offers investment banking products and services.

We
act as a broker or intermediary for all classes of reinsurance. We place two main types of property and casualty reinsurance: treaty reinsurance, which involves the transfer of a
portfolio of risks, and facultative reinsurance, which entails the transfer of part or all of the coverage provided by a single insurance policy. We also place specialty lines such as professional
liability, medical malpractice, accident, life and health.

We
also provide actuarial, enterprise risk management, catastrophe management and rating agency advisory services. We have also developed tools and models that help our clients
understand the financial implications of natural and man-made catastrophes around the world. Aon Benfield Securities provides global investment banking services for insurance and
reinsurance clients. In this capacity, Aon Benfield Securities is recognized as a leader in: (i) the structuring, underwriting and trading of insurance-linked securities; (ii) the
arrangement of financing for insurance and reinsurance
companies, including Lloyd's syndicates; and (iii) providing advice on strategic and capital alternatives, including mergers and acquisitions.


Compensation

We generate revenues through commissions, fees from clients, and compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we
provide to them. Commission rates and fees vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services
provided to an insurer or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Payment terms are competitive with current industry practice.

We
typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. These funds held on behalf of
clients are generally invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the
insurance carriers. We earn interest on these accounts. However, the principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes.

Competition

The risk and insurance brokerage services business is highly competitive, and we compete primarily with two other global insurance
brokers, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Group Holdings Ltd., in addition to numerous specialists, regional and local firms in almost every area of our business. We
also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents; and with other businesses that do not fall into the
categories above, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms, and consultants that provide risk-related services and products. We are ranked as the largest retail
insurance broker worldwide based on pure brokerage operations, as well as the largest worldwide reinsurance broker, and we have been recognized by the readers of Business Insurance magazine as the
leading retail/agent broker with greater than $250 million in revenue for the last three consecutive years.

Seasonality

The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment typically experiences higher revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters of
each year, primarily due to the timing of policy renewals.

Consulting

The Consulting segment generated approximately 17% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009. This segment has approximately 6,400
employees worldwide with operations in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Europe, South Africa, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region.

Principal Products and Services

We provide products and services in this segment primarily through Aon Consulting, offering a broad range of consulting services in the
following practice areas:

Consulting Services:

Health and Benefits

advises clients about structuring, funding, and administering
employee benefit programs, which attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence
management, benefits administration, data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory, and elective benefits services.

Retirement

specializes in providing global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting, tax and ERISA
consulting, and pension administration.


Compensation

focuses on compensation advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey
and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.

Strategic Human Capital

delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues,
including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change
management.

Outsourcing:

Human Resource Outsourcing

offers employment processing, performance improvement,
benefits administration, and other employment-related services.

Aon
Consulting works to maximize the value of clients' human resources spending, increase employee productivity, and improve employee performance. Our approach addresses a trend toward
more diverse workforces (demographics, nationalities, cultures and work/lifestyle preferences) that require more choices and flexibility among employers — in order that they can
provide benefit options suited to individual needs.

Our
consulting professionals work with their clients to identify options in human resource outsourcing and process improvements. Prime areas where companies choose to use outsourcing
services include the assessment and selection of job candidates, employment processing, training and development, benefits administration, and the individual benefits enrollment process.

Compensation

Revenues are principally derived from fees paid by clients for advice and services. In addition, insurance companies pay us commissions
for placing individual and group insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages, and pay us fees for consulting and other services that we provide to them. Payment terms are
competitive with current industry practice.

Competition

Our consulting business faces strong competition from other worldwide and national consulting companies, as well as regional and local
firms. Competitors include independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. Some of our competitors
provide administrative or consulting services as an adjunct to other primary services. Based on total revenues, we believe we are among the top five largest employee benefits consultants in the world.

Seasonality

Due to buying patterns in the markets we serve, revenues tend to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter.

Licensing and Regulation

Our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as
the laws of other countries in which we operate. See the discussion contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by
regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.


Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services

Regulatory authorities in the states or countries in which the operating subsidiaries of our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services
segment conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as producers, brokers, agents, third party administrators, managing general agents, reinsurance intermediaries, or
adjusters.

Under
the laws of most states in the U.S. and most foreign countries, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting, renewing and revoking producers',
brokers' and agents' licenses to transact business in the state or country. The operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular state or country, which may require,
among other things, that a firm operate in the state or country through a local corporation. In a few states and countries, licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned
business entities. In such cases, our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the state or country.

Our
subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are enforced by state agencies in the U.S., by the
Financial Services Authority ("FSA") in the U.K., and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business,
licensing of agents, monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, limits on commission rates, and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements.

Insurance
authorities in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, including the FSA in the U.K., also have enacted laws and regulations governing the
investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the
types of investments that may be made with them.

Further,
certain of our business activities within the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment are governed by other regulatory bodies, including investment, securities and futures
licensing authorities. In the U.S., Aon Consulting, Aon Risk Services and Aon Benfield utilize Aon Benfield Securities, Inc., a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member of
FINRA/SIPC, and
an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon, for investment banking services and other broker-dealer activities.

Consulting

Certain of the retirement-related consulting services provided by Aon Consulting and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the
pension and financial laws and regulations of applicable jurisdictions, including oversight and/or supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in the U.S., the FSA in the U.K., and
regulators in other countries. In addition, other services provided by Aon Consulting and its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as trustee services, investment services (including advice to clients on
the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services, are subject in
various jurisdictions to pension, investment, and securities and/or insurance laws and regulations and/or supervision by national regulators.

Clientele

Our clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the world. No one client accounted for more than 10% of our
consolidated total revenues in 2009. Additionally, we place insurance with many insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total premiums we placed on behalf of
our clients in 2009.


Segmentation of Activity by Type of Service and Geographic Area of Operation

Financial information relating to the types of services provided by us and the geographic areas of our operations is incorporated
herein by reference to Note 19, "Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Employees

At December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 36,200 employees, of which approximately 10,600 work in the U.S.

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions
for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of
future events. They use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "intend," "plan," "potential," and other similar terms, and future or conditional tense
verbs like "could," "may," "might," "should," "will" and "would." You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. For
example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: market and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends; changes in our business strategies and methods
of generating revenue; the development and performance of our services and products; changes in the composition or level of our revenues; our cost structure and the outcome of cost-saving
or restructuring initiatives; the outcome of contingencies; dividend policy; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; pension obligations; cash flow and liquidity; future actions by
regulators; and the impact of changes in accounting rules. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. Potential factors that could impact results include:

•

general economic conditions in different countries in which we do business around the world;

•

changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets;

•

fluctuations in exchange and interest rates that could impact revenue and expense;

•

rating agency actions that could affect our ability to borrow funds;

•

changes in the funded status of our various defined benefit pension plans and the impact of any increased pension funding
resulting from those changes;

•

changes in the competitive environment;

•

our ability to implement restructuring initiatives and other initiatives intended to yield cost savings and the ability to
achieve those cost savings;

•

the impact on risk and insurance services commission revenues of changes in the availability of, and the premium insurance
carriers charge for, insurance and reinsurance products, including the impact on premium rates and market capacity attributable to catastrophic events;


•

the outcome of inquiries from regulators and investigations related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws;

•

the impact of investigations brought by U.S. state attorneys general, U.S. state insurance regulators, U.S. federal
prosecutors, U.S. federal regulators, and regulatory authorities in the U.K. and other countries;

•

the impact of class actions and individual lawsuits including client class actions, securities class actions, derivative
actions and ERISA class actions;

•

the cost of resolution of other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies, including potential liabilities arising
from errors and omissions claims against us;

•

the extent to which we retain existing clients and attract new business, and our ability to incentivize and retain key
employees;

•

the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, particularly given the global scope of our businesses and the possibility of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions in which we do business; and

•

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Benfield merger.

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about our performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and
its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the dates on which they are made. We are under no obligation (and expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or alter any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information about factors that could materially affect Aon, including our results of operations and financial condition, is
contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

The following discussion of risk factors contains "forward-looking statements," as discussed in the "Business" section of
Part I, Item 1 of this report. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following
information should be read in conjunction with the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("MD&A") section in Part II, Item 7, and the


Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes in the "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" section of Part II, Item 8 of this report.

We
caution the reader that the following risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in
forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.

Our results may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.

Our
results have historically been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry. A significant portion of our Risk and Insurance
Brokerage Services revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues
and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing
cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.

In
addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to
meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to "self-insure," the use of so-called "captive" insurers,
and the advent of capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance and reinsurance needs.

Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.

Since
the Attorney General of New York ("NYAG") brought charges against one of our competitors in 2004, there has been uncertainty concerning then longstanding methods of compensating
insurance brokers. Soon after the NYAG brought those charges, Aon and certain other large insurance brokers announced that they would terminate contingent commission arrangements with underwriters
and, during the period 2005 through 2008, Aon and three other large insurance brokers entered into agreements with a number of state attorneys general and insurance regulators in which they covenanted
to refrain from taking contingent commissions. Most other insurance brokers, however, continued to enter into contingent commission arrangements, and regulators have not taken action consistently to
end or prohibit such arrangements. In July 2008, New York regulators held hearings on potential rules relating to insurance producer compensation and disclosures. As a result of those hearings and
public comments, New York regulators promulgated Regulation No. 194 in February 2010, which is expected to be effective January 1, 2011. Regulation No. 194 does not prohibit
producers from accepting contingent commissions as compensation from insurers, but does obligate all insurance producers to abide by certain minimally prescribed uniform standards of compensation
disclosure. Effective as of February 11, 2010, we entered into an amended and restated agreement (the "Amended Settlement Agreement") with the Attorneys General of the States of New York,
Illinois and Connecticut, the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, which supersedes and replaces the
earlier agreement with those regulators. The Amended Settlement Agreement requires us, among other things, to provide, throughout the United States, compensation disclosure that complies, at a
minimum, with the requirements of Regulation 194 or the provisions of the original settlement agreement with those regulators. The Amended Settlement Agreement also requires compliance with any
rules, regulations or guidance issued by the attorneys general or insurance departments of Illinois, Connecticut and any other states in which we conduct business. The Amended Settlement Agreement
does not prohibit us from accepting contingent compensation. Notwithstanding the Amended Settlement Agreement, we remain bound by: (1) the Settlement Agreement entered into in 2008 between Aon
and the Florida


Department
of Financial Services, the Florida Department of Legal Affairs, Office of the Attorney General, and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation; and (2) the Agreement entered in 2006
between certain insurance regulator members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners of 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam and Aon, both of which prohibit us from accepting or
requesting of any insurer contingent compensation and impose certain business reforms.

Our results may be adversely affected by the impact that disruptions in the credit and financial markets have on our customers and the insurance
industry.

Beginning
in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the
deterioration of the financial markets. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets may reduce our customers' demand for our brokerage and reinsurance services and products,
including increasing their levels of self-insurance. Other clients may be significantly impacted by credit pressures or other financial difficulties which could result in their insolvency.
These events could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance
coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which could then reduce placement of certain
lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by clients.

The
current economic conditions have also created significant uncertainty in the industries in which our consulting operations participate. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn
could hurt our clients' financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. These challenges may reduce demand for some of our services or
depress pricing of those services and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.

We
believe that competition in our brokerage lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength and name recognition. In particular,
we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.

We
encounter strong competition for both clients and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms that also
operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance
products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk related services and
products. Our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms
around the world.

We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plans.

We
announced a global restructuring plan (the "Aon Benfield Plan") in connection with our merger with Benfield in 2008. The restructuring plan is intended to integrate and streamline
operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 700 job eliminations, the closing or consolidation of several offices, asset impairments and other
expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We estimate that the Aon Benfield Plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $155 million over a three-year
period, of which $55 million of these costs were included in the purchase price allocation and $100 million of which have been or will be charged to earnings. We anticipate that our
annualized savings from the Aon Benfield Plan will be approximately $122 million in 2011. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.


In
2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and to reduce future expense growth to better serve clients (the "2007 Plan"). As a
result, we have adopted restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in the elimination of an estimated 4,600 employee positions, the closing or consolidation of various offices, asset
impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We estimate that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges of $750 million. We anticipate that our
annualized savings from the 2007 Plan will be approximately $536 million by the end of 2010. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.

Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition
or results

.

Operating
funds available for corporate use and funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $639 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009.
These funds are reported in cash, short-term investments, and fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31,
2009, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $319 million. Changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these
funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from cash balances
and short-term investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our long-term investments.
We monitor our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairments in carrying value. For securities judged to have an other-than-temporary impairment, we
write down the value of those securities and recognize a realized loss through the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Our pension obligations could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.

To
the extent that the present value of the pension obligations associated with our major plans continue to exceed the value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial
position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In certain previous years, there have been declines in interest rates. As a result of lower interest rates and investment returns, the
present value of plan liabilities increased faster than the value of plan assets, resulting in significantly higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans.

We
currently plan on contributing approximately $381 million to our major pension plans in 2010, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these
pension plans in 2009 were $437 million, which was an increase of $260 million from 2008.

The
magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our pension expense is comparatively sensitive to various market factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns,
the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty
exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our financial position and results of
operations from year to year.

The
periodic revision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting periodic pension
expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions. As a result, there
can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in
the future beyond those that have been estimated.


We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.

We
are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which frequently include errors and omissions ("E&O") claims.
The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. We have historically purchased E&O insurance and
other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. However, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us and,
consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have
been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Amounts related to
settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

At
the time of the 2004-05 investigation of the insurance industry by the NYAG and other regulators, purported classes of clients filed civil litigation against us and other
companies under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act ("RICO") theories. The federal actions were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was filed in California. In the New Jersey
actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' federal antitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. We believe we have
meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result,
cannot be predicted at this time.

Also
at the time of the NYAG investigation, putative classes filed actions against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the federal securities laws
and ERISA. Plaintiffs in the federal securities class action originally submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $353 million to $490 million, and
plaintiffs in the ERISA class actions originally
submitted revised purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $74 million to $349 million. To protect against the uncertain outcome of litigation and to contain
exposure to us, we settled the securities suit for $30 million in 2009 and have reached an agreement in principle to settle the ERISA suit for $1.8 million. On November 24, 2009,
the Court entered a final order approving the settlement and dismissing the securities suit. The proposed ERISA settlement is subject to documentation, notice and court approval.

Following
inquiries from regulators, we commenced an internal review of our compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). In January 2009, Aon Limited, our principal U.K. brokerage subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with the FSA to pay a
£5.25 million fine arising from its failure to exercise reasonable care to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to counter the risks of bribery arising from the use
of overseas firms and individuals who helped it win business. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") continue to investigate these matters. We are fully cooperating with these
investigations and have agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current information, we are unable to predict at
this time when the SEC and DOJ matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.

A
putative class action,

Buckner v. Resource Life

, is pending in state court in Columbus, Georgia against a former subsidiary of ours,
Resource Life Insurance Company. The complaint alleges that Resource Life, which wrote policies insuring repayment of auto loans, was obligated to identify and return unearned premiums to
policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled


terms.
In connection with the sale of Resource Life in 2006, we agreed to indemnify Resource Life's buyer in certain respects relating to this action. We believe that Resource Life has meritorious
defenses, and Resource Life is vigorously defending this action. In October 2009, the court certified a nationwide class of policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled terms
and who Resource Life cannot prove received a refund of unearned premium. Resource Life has taken an appeal from that decision. Also in October 2009, we filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court seeking
a declaratory judgment with respect to our and Resource Life's rights and obligations under the indemnity agreement. The outcome of the actions, and the amount of any losses or other payments that may
result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Although
the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us, on the basis of present information,
amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.

In
addition to the matters referred to above, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments
represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible
recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated
amounts payable which are deemed to be probable and estimable are accrued in our consolidated financial statements.

We
have total letters of credit ("LOC") outstanding for approximately $153 million at December 31, 2009. These letters of credit are for the benefit of Virginia Surety
Company ("VSC") related to a non-performance risk of reinsurers of VSC's worker's compensation business in California, a LOC that secures deductible retentions for our own workers
compensation program, and LOCs to cover the beneficiaries related to our Canadian pension plan scheme, secure one of our U.S. pension plans, and to cover contingent payments for taxes and other
business obligations to third parties.

We are subject to E&O claims against us.

We
assist our clients with various matters, including the placement of insurance coverage or employee benefit plans and the handling of related claims. E&O claims against us may allege
our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place
coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always
possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, E&O claims may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts
that could, if awarded, be significant and, in addition to potential liability for monetary damages, could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. In
recent years, we have assumed increasing levels of self-insurance for potential E&O exposures. We use case level reviews by inside and outside counsel to establish loss reserves in
accordance with applicable accounting standards. These reserves are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as developments warrant. Nevertheless, given the unpredictability of E&O claims and of litigation,
it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.


Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.

Our
future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including brokers and other professional personnel. Competition for such experienced professional
personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.

Our
businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the
costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services, or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of
regulatory actions or proceedings. With respect to our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services business, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third party
administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in
the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.
Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an
insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those
operations.

Although
the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan
regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, and the FCPA, do affect the
insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.

With
respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the
amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses and increased training and employee expenses. Furthermore, the loss
of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.

In
all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively
broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our
activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the
past.

In
addition, new legislative or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us. These developments include:

•

the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;

•

changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;

•

the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or
other alternative types of coverage;


•

changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans; or

•

additional regulations promulgated by the FSA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we
operate.

Competition
resulting from these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.

Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.

A
significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries,
including:

•

the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries;

•

devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;

•

imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign
subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and
compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;

•

hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;

•

longer payment cycles;

•

greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection; and

•

the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.

Because
a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change
over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our four largest exposures in order of sensitivity are the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and
Canadian Dollar. As slightly more than half of our pretax income is non-U.S. Dollar denominated, a weaker U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, would produce
more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements. Offsetting our normal translation exposure is our transactional exposure between the U.S. Dollar revenue and British Pound expense. In
the U.K., part of our revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, although our operating expenses are denominated in British Pounds. Therefore, a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound would
produce more profitable results in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the
value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the real cost to our customers in foreign markets where we receive our revenue in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could
potentially affect demand for our services.


Although
we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such
risks, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.

Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity

.

The
demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the
commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is described as exposure units, and is most closely
correlated with employment levels, corporate revenue and asset values. A growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could
adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are
generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients
become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with us.

We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.

As
of December 31, 2009, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.0 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial
flexibility. We also bear risk at the time debt matures. If at the time of maturity we do not have sufficient operating cash or credit lines to repay the borrowing and are unable to borrow from a
third party in an amount sufficient to repay the maturing debt, then an event of default would occur.

We
have two primary committed credit facilities outstanding, one for our U.S. operations, the other for our European operations. The U.S. facility totals $400 million and matures
in December 2012. It is intended as a back-up against commercial paper or to address capital needs in times of extreme liquidity pressure. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings
under this facility. The Euro facility totals €650 million ($937 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) and matures in October 2010. It is intended as a
revolving working capital line for our European operations. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings under this facility. Both facilities require certain representations and warranties to be
made before drawing and both have the same financial covenants. The representations and warrants are standard for agreements of this type and include such things as: compliance with laws and
contracts, timely filing of taxes, and insurance licenses in good standing. For both facilities, we are required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of at least 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of no greater than 3 to 1. At December 31, 2009, we could make all
representations and warranties and were within our financial covenants.

A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial
flexibility

.

A
downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, and reduce our financial
flexibility. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2009 were BBB+ (Standard & Poor's and Fitch, Inc.) and Baa2 (Moody's Investor Services).

A
downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. We cannot assume that our financial
position would not be adversely affected if we were unable to access the commercial paper market.


Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.

We
prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets,
contingencies, share-based payments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual
results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accounting standards could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

Our
principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest
on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses. While our principal subsidiaries currently are not limited by material contractual restrictions on
their abilities to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their capital stock to us, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions
in which they operate. These regulatory restrictions may limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can pay in dividends or advance to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further
regulatory actions restricting the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, due to differences in tax rates, repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have
unfavorable tax ramifications for us.

The occurrence of natural or man made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

.

We
are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tornadoes, and pandemic health events such as H1N1 influenza, as
well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global
financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other
things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which
could disrupt our normal business operations.

A
natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In
addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies' ability to pay principal or interest on their securities. Finally, a natural or
man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.

Through
our merger with Benfield, we acquired equity interests in Juniperus Insurance Opportunities Fund Limited ("Juniperus") and Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited
("JCHL"). Juniperus invests its equity in a limited liability company that is expected to invest in excess of 70% of its assets in collateralized reinsurance transactions through
collateralized swaps with a reinsurance company, and the remaining assets in instruments such as catastrophe bonds, industry loss warrants and insurer or reinsurer sidecar debt and equity
arrangements. JCHL provides investment management and related services to Juniperus. If a disaster such as wind, earthquakes or other named catastrophe occurs, we could lose some or all of our equity
investment in Juniperus of approximately $73 million.


As part of the Benfield merger, we acquired Benfield's equity stake in certain Florida-domiciled homeowner insurance companies. We maintain ongoing agreements to provide modeling,
actuarial, and consulting services to these insurance companies. These firms' financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing their underwriting reserves differ from
actual experience. Reserve estimates represent informed judgments based on currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability
and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal
developments and legislative changes, can cause estimates to vary. Additionally, a natural disaster occurring in Florida could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims relating to these
existing service agreements.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital,
regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Should
we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss,
telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper
functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing
back-up systems would provide us with an important advantage. Nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our
operations, such as key executive officers or personnel.

Our
operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on
our operations. We could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.

We
regularly assess and take steps to improve upon our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain
of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our
business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.

One
of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients' confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and
retirement and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot
entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and
laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.

Further,
data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Our
failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the
marketplace.

In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy, we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses.

In
pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses, or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to
identify


appropriate
acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will
realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully
into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain
businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.

The global nature of our business and the resolution of tax disputes could create volatility in our effective tax rate, could expose us to greater than anticipated tax
liabilities and could cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in
tax legislation, our global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the timing and recognition of goodwill impairments, the transfer pricing of revenues and costs, acquisitions and
dispositions, and the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. It is
complex to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations administered by foreign governmental agencies, some of which may conflict with the U.S. or other foreign law. Our determination of
our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Favorable resolution of such matters would typically be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of
resolution. Conversely, unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. Such an adverse outcome could
have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our
financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While historically we have not experienced significant adjustments
to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns, there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise.

The anticipated benefits from the merger with Benfield may not be realized

.

The
success of the merger with Benfield will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Aon and Benfield including, among other
things, synergies, cost savings, operating efficiencies and the integration of information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems. Although we
expect to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, no assurance can be given that we will successfully combine the businesses of Aon and Benfield and that these anticipated benefits will
actually be achieved because achieving such benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties. Additionally, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than
anticipated, and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating Benfield with Aon. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and
cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If we fail to realize all or some of the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition or if
we fail to realize those benefits in the anticipated time period, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.


Item 2.    Properties.

We have offices in various locations throughout the world. Substantially all of our offices are located in leased premises. We maintain
our corporate headquarters at 200 E. Randolph Street in Chicago, Illinois, where we occupy approximately 327,000 square feet of space under an operating lease agreement that expires in 2013. There are
two five-year renewal options at current market rates. We also occupy significant space at 199 Water Street in New York, New York (339,000 square feet under a lease expiring in 2018),
Devonshire Square and 55 Bishopsgate in London, United Kingdom (279,000 square feet under leases expiring in 2018 and 2023, respectively), 1000 N. Milwaukee Avenue in Glenview, Illinois (230,000
square feet under a lease expiring in 2017), and own a building at Paalbergweg 2-4, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (150,000 square feet).

In
general, no difficulty is anticipated in negotiating renewals as leases expire or in finding other satisfactory space if the premises become unavailable. We believe that the
facilities we occupy are adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used and are well maintained. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to
third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. See Note 10 "Lease Commitments" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8 of this report for information with respect to our lease commitments at December 31, 2009.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings.

We hereby incorporate by reference Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

None.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2009 FINANCIAL RESULTS

The challenging global recession continues to provide significant headwinds for our business. We continue to operate in a soft
insurance pricing market, as property and casualty rates continue to decline. In addition to pricing declines, volume is negatively impacted by the current economic environment, which places pressure
on our business in three primary ways:

•

declining insurable risks due to decreasing asset values, including property values, shipment volumes, payroll and number
of active employees,

•

client cost-driven behavior, where clients are actively looking to reduce spending in order to meet budget
reductions, and increase risk retention, as a result of prioritizing their total spending, and

•

sector specific weakness, including financial services, construction, private equity, and mergers and acquisitions, all of
which have been particularly impacted by the current recession.

Our
revenue for 2009 was negatively impacted as a result of this difficult market environment. We continue to demonstrate expense discipline, holding expenses to last year's levels while
we continue to invest in our businesses.

We
have made three key commitments to shareholders — grow organically, expand margins, and increase earnings per share. The following is our measure of performance
against these three metrics for 2009:

•

Organic revenue, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results — General" below,
declined 1% as a result of weak economic conditions globally.

•

Achieved an adjusted pretax margin, as defined under the caption "Review of Consolidated Results —
General" below, of 17.2% for Aon overall, 20% for the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, and 17.4% for the Consulting segment.

•

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Aon's stockholders increased 7% to $2.19 per share
in 2009, from $2.04 per share in 2008.

Additionally,
the following is a summary of our 2009 financial results:

•

Revenue increased $67 million, or 1%, to $7.6 billion, as additional revenue from the Benfield merger and
other acquisitions was mainly offset by the negative effect of foreign currency translation and $97 million lower fiduciary investment income due to the decline in global interest rates.

•

Operating expenses of $6.6 billion were comparable with last year, as favorable foreign currency translation,
restructuring and other operational expense savings, lower E&O costs resulting from insurance recoveries, a net pension curtailment gain recognized in 2009 of $78 million related to the
decision to cease crediting future benefits relating to salary and service in our U.S. and Canada defined benefit pension plans, and a reduction in incentive compensation were offset by the increased
expenses associated with the Benfield merger and other acquisitions and higher restructuring charges.

•

Our consolidated operating margin from continuing operations for the year improved from 12.5% in 2008 to 13.4% in 2009.
The increase was principally driven by a 1% growth in revenue, along with expense management.

•

Net income from continuing operations attributable to Aon stockholders increased 2% or $15 million from 2008 to
$636 million.


REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

General

In our discussion of operating results, we sometimes refer to supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information
specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted pretax margin, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results.

Organic Revenue Growth

We use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing
operations. Organic revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between business units, fiduciary investment income, reimbursable
expenses, and unusual items. Supplemental information related to organic growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and should be viewed
in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Statements of Income. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical
adjustments. Reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure, organic revenue growth percentages to the reported Commissions, fees and other revenue growth percentages, has been provided in the
"Review by Segment" caption, below.

Adjusted Pretax Margins

We use adjusted pretax margin as a measure of core operating performance of our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting
businesses. Adjusted pretax margin excludes the impact of restructuring charges and certain non-recurring costs such as pension curtailments, costs for anti-bribery and
compliance initiatives and Benfield integration costs. This supplemental information related to adjusted pretax margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be
viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Statements of Income. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported pretax margin is as follows (in millions):

Impact of Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations

Because we conduct business in more than 120 countries, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business.
In comparison to the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income.
Therefore, to give financial statement users more meaningful information about our


operations,
we have provided a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in
currencies between periods by translating last year's revenue, expenses and net income at this year's foreign exchange rates.

Consolidated Results for 2009 Compared to 2008

Revenue

Revenue increased by $67 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase reflects a $108 million, or 2%, increase
in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $49 million increase associated with corporate ownership in insurance investments obtained as part of the acquisition of Benfield
Group Limited ("Benfield") in November 2008, partially offset by an $89 million, or 7%, decrease in the Consulting segment. This 2% increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment
was primarily driven by increased commissions and fees attributable to Benfield, partially offset by a $95 million decrease in fiduciary investment income due to declines in global interest
rates, the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decline in organic
revenue reflecting the weak economic conditions globally. The 7% decrease in the Consulting segment was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a 2% decline in organic
revenue reflecting the impact of the economic downturn, and the impact of the previously announced termination of an outsourcing contract with AT&T.


Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits increased by $16 million, essentially even with 2008. This increase reflects a $70 million, or
2%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $7 million, or 12%, increase in unallocated expenses, partially offset by a $61 million, or 7%, decrease in the
Consulting segment. The slight increase overall from last year was driven by the impact of Benfield and higher restructuring costs, which were offset by favorable foreign currency translation,
restructuring savings, gains related to the pension curtailments and lower incentive compensation.

Other General Expenses

Other general expenses decreased by $30 million, or 1%, in 2009 compared to 2008. This decrease reflects a $16 million,
or 1%, decline in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $23 million, or 7%, decrease in the Consulting segment, partially offset by a $9 million increase in unallocated
expenses. The overall decline was driven by favorable foreign exchange, lower E&O expenses due to insurance recoveries, restructuring savings, operational expense management, and reduced costs related
to our FCPA and anti-corruption reviews and related compliance initiatives. These items exceeded the impact of Benfield, including increased intangible amortization related to the merger,
and higher restructuring charges.

Interest Income

Interest income, which represents income earned on operating cash balances and miscellaneous income-producing securities, decreased
$64 million from 2008 and was driven mainly by lower investment balances, the global decline in interest rates in 2009 and a decrease in income from our Private Equity Partnership Structures
I, LLC ("PEPS I") investment.

Interest Expense

Interest expense declined $4 million, due primarily to the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates, which was mostly offset
by higher interest rates following the third quarter issuance of €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of long-term debt at a
6.25% coupon, which replaced debt borrowed at lower rates under our Euro credit facility.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) was $20 million of income for 2009 versus an expense of $29 million in 2008. This change reflects
a $7 million decrease in income in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, a $1 million increase in income in the Consulting segment, and a $55 million reduction in
unallocated expenses. The $7 million decline in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment was primarily driven by a gain on the sale of land recognized in 2008 of $5 million and
lower earnings from our non-consolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by higher gains on the disposal of several small subsidiaries. The $55 million improvement in unallocated
expenses was due to $50 million of costs recognized in 2008 associated with acquiring Benfield, along with a $5 million gain recognized in 2009 on the extinguishment of
$15 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures.

Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $949 million, an 8% increase from $879 million in 2008. The
improvement was driven by the additional earnings from
Benfield and other acquisitions, restructuring and other operational expense savings, and the net pension curtailment gain, which more than offset the impact of higher restructuring costs, lower
fiduciary investment and interest income and unfavorable foreign currency translation.


Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 28.2% and 27.5% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase reflects
the changes in the mix between our U.S. and international pretax income.

Income from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased to $681 million ($2.19 diluted net income per share) from $637 million ($2.04
diluted net income per share) in 2008. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted income from continuing operations in 2009 by $0.02 per diluted share when the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Income is
translated using 2009 foreign exchange rates. Income from continuing operations in 2008 was positively impacted by $0.16 per diluted share due to currency fluctuations between 2007 and 2008.

Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations decreased $730 million to $111 million ($0.38 diluted net income per share) in 2009
from $841 million ($2.76 diluted net income per share) in 2008. The 2009 results include the recognition of a $55 million foreign tax carryback related to the sale of CICA, the gain on
the sale of AIS, results from our P&C operations through the date of disposal, a curtailment gain on the post-retirement benefit plan related to the CICA disposal, and residual tax
settlements related to our AWG disposal. The 2008 results include the gain on the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries ($935 million) and the operations of CICA and
Sterling for the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by a loss recognized on our remaining P&C operations.

Consolidated Results for 2008 Compared to 2007

Revenue

Revenue increased by $294 million, or 4%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase principally reflects a $279 million, or
5%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and an $11 million, or 1%, increase in the Consulting segment. The 5% increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services
segment was primarily driven by organic growth in our reinsurance and most of our retail operations, as well as the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates. The small increase in the Consulting
segment was primarily driven by growth in most major practice groups and geographies, mostly offset by the negative impact of the terminated outsourcing contract with AT&T.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits increased by $240 million, or 6%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase reflects a
$250 million, or 7%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, which more than offset an $8 million, or 1%, decline in the Consulting segment and a
$2 million, or 3%, decrease in unallocated expenses. The overall 6% increase was primarily driven by higher restructuring expenses, the impact of acquisitions, unfavorable foreign currency
translation, and higher salaries and incentive costs, partially offset by restructuring and pension expense savings.

Other General Expenses

Other general expenses increased by $117 million, or 6%, in 2008 compared to 2007. This increase reflects a $137 million,
or 9%, increase in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment, partially offset by a $9 million, or 3%, decrease in the Consulting segment and an $11 million decrease in
unallocated expenses. The increase was driven by higher E&O expenses, costs related to our FCPA and anti-corruption reviews and related compliance initiatives, increased restructuring
charges, higher


expense
due to increased amortization resulting from recent acquisitions, and higher depreciation from restructuring-related impairments and higher software amortization. These increases were
partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains and one-time expenses in 2007 relating to the settlement of litigation for acquired employees in our U.K. reinsurance business.

Interest Income

Interest income decreased $6 million, or 6%, from 2007, resulting from lower non-liquidating distributions from our
PEPS I investment of $29 million and lower global interest rates, partially offset by interest income on higher invested balances from selling CICA and Sterling.

Interest Expense

Interest expense declined $12 million, due primarily to the redemption of our 3.5% Senior Convertible Debentures during 2007.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) was $29 million of expense in 2008 versus income of $58 million in 2007. This change reflects a
$25 million decrease in income in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment and a $62 million increase in unallocated expenses. The $25 million decline in the Risk and
Insurance Brokerage Services segment was primarily driven by lower gains on the disposal of several small subsidiaries. The $62 million increase in unallocated expenses was due to
$50 million of costs recognized in 2008 associated with acquiring Benfield, along with lower realized gains from the sale of investments.

Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes

Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $879 million, a 14% decrease from $1,023 million in 2007. The
decrease was driven by higher restructuring costs, costs associated with acquiring Benfield, and expenses related to FCPA and anti-corruption investigations and compliance initiatives,
which more than offset organic revenue growth in both of our segments and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 27.5% in 2008 and 34.0% in 2007 primarily due to changes in the mix
between our U.S. and international pretax income.

Income from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations declined to $637 million ($2.04 diluted net income per share) in 2008 from $675 million
($2.04 diluted net income per share) in 2007. Currency fluctuations positively impacted income from continuing operations in 2008 by $0.16 per diluted share when the 2007 Consolidated Statement of
Income is translated using 2008 foreign exchange rates.

Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations increased to $841 million ($2.76 diluted net income per share) in 2008 from
$202 million ($0.62 diluted net income per share) in 2007. The 2008 results include the gain on the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries, the operations of CICA and Sterling for the first
quarter of 2008, and the full-year operations of AIS. These gains were partially offset by a loss recognized on sale of our remaining P&C operations. The results in 2007 mainly reflected a
full year of operations for CICA, Sterling, AIS and our remaining P&C operations.


Restructuring Initiatives

Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan

We announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with our 2008 merger with Benfield. The restructuring
plan is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 700 job eliminations. Additionally, duplicate space
and assets will be abandoned. We originally estimated that this plan would result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, of which
$104 million was recorded as part of the Benfield purchase price allocation and $81 million of which was expected to result in future charges to earnings. During 2009, we reduced the
Benfield purchase price allocation by $49 million to reflect actual severance costs being lower than originally estimated. We currently estimate the Plan will result in cumulative costs
totaling approximately $155 million, of which $55 million was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation, $55 million has been recorded in earnings and we estimate an
additional $45 million will be recorded in future earnings.

As
of December 31, 2009, approximately 530 jobs have been eliminated under this Plan. Total payments of $67 million have been made under the Aon Benfield Plan to date.

All
costs associated with the Aon Benfield Plan are included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and
benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations into 2011.

The
restructuring plan, before any potential reinvestment of savings, is expected to deliver cumulative cost savings of approximately $90 to $100 million in 2010 and
$122 million in 2011. We estimate that we realized approximately $45 million of cost savings in 2009. The actual savings, total costs and timing of the restructuring plan may vary from
those estimated due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions of the plan, and foreign exchange rates.

2007 Restructuring Plan

In 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense growth
to better serve clients ("2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan includes an estimated 4,600 job eliminations. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 3,100 positions have been eliminated. We have closed or
consolidated several offices resulting in sublease losses or lease buy-outs. We currently estimate that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately
$750 million. Expenses include workforce reduction, lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, as well as other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative. Costs related to
the restructuring are included in Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We expect the restructuring and related expenses to affect continuing
operations through the first half of 2010. We estimate that we realized approximately $269 million of cost savings in 2009. We anticipate that these initiatives will lead to annualized cost
savings, before any potential reinvestment of savings, of approximately $536 million by the end of 2010. However, there can be no assurances that we will achieve the targeted savings.

The
following is a summary of the restructuring and related expenses by type that have been incurred and are estimated to be incurred through the end of the restructuring initiative

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity

Executive Summary

Our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with financial flexibility to create long-term value for our
shareholders. This was highlighted by the repurchase of $590 million of common stock during 2009 and the authorization of a new $2 billion share repurchase program. Aon's liquidity needs
are primarily for operating expenses, acquisitions, share repurchases, restructuring, funding pension obligations and paying dividends to shareholders.

Liquidity
is derived from the cash flows from our businesses and from financing activities. Cash on our balance sheets include funds available for general corporate purposes. Funds held
on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with insurance premiums receivable in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a
corresponding offset in Fiduciary liabilities. Fiduciary funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for Aon.

We
use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision-making, including net cash provided by operations, free cash flow, net debt-to-capital
and return on capital. We believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 decreased $584 million compared with 2008, due primarily to the change in
client-held funds. Excluding the change in client-held funds, cash provided from operating activities increased $31 million compared to 2008. The primary contributors to
cash flow from operations, excluding the change in client-held funds, in 2009 were net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1.3 billion and $67 million of
restructuring expense in excess of cash payments, partially offset by $404 million of cash contributions to our major defined pension plans in excess of pension expense, net of curtailment
gains, a $105 million decrease in current income taxes, a $63 million increase in receivables, a $54 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a
$266 million decrease in other assets and liabilities. The large pension cash contributions are primarily driven by new funding agreements for our U.K. pension plans completed during the year.
Pension contributions for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $437 million. In 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $381 million to our pension plans. Payments made for
our various restructuring programs amounted to $327 million during 2009, and are expected to be $290 million in 2010.

We
expect cash generated by operations for 2010 to be sufficient to service debt and contractual obligations, fund cash requirements of our restructuring programs, finance capital
expenditures,
continue acquisition of shares under our share repurchase program, and continue paying dividends to our shareholders. Although 2010 cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these
obligations, we have the ability to borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate timing differences in cash flows. We have committed credit facilities of approximately $1.3 billion that
are currently undrawn and that can be accessed on a same-day basis. Additionally, we believe we could access capital markets for debt financing for longer-term funding, under
current market conditions, if needed.

Net
cash provided by operating activities in 2008 decreased $304 million compared with 2007. Excluding the change in client-held funds, cash provided from operating
activities decreased $779 million compared to 2007, primarily attributable to a $765 million decrease in net income (adjusted for non-cash items), reflecting
$376 million of taxes paid on the gain from the sales of CICA and Sterling, as well as $330 million less cash flow from the operations of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries, which
were sold on April 1, 2008.

Investing Activities

Cash used for investing activities was $139 million in 2009, primarily comprised of $274 million paid to acquire 14
businesses, including Allied North America and FCC Global Insurance Services, $158 million paid to purchase long-term investments, and $140 million for capital expenditures,
partially offset by $332 million of net proceeds from the sales of short- and long-term investments.

Cash
provided by investing activities was $1.4 billion in 2008. During 2008, we received $2.8 billion in proceeds from the sale of CICA and Sterling, partially offset by
$1.1 billion paid for Benfield and other acquisitions.

Cash
used for investing activities was $463 million in 2007, principally $251 million paid to acquire businesses and $170 million for capital expenditures.

Financing Activities

Cash used for financing activities in 2009 was $617 million. The net impact of treasury stock transactions reflects the purchase
of $590 million of treasury shares, partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares purchased through the employee stock purchase plan. During
2009, we received $684 million from the issuance of long-term debt, primarily €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25%
senior unsecured debentures. These funds were primarily used to pay down our borrowings under our Euro credit


facility.
We also used $100 million for the repayment of short-term debt related to a variable interest entity ("VIE") for which we were the primary beneficiary. Cash dividends of
$165 million were paid to shareholders.

Cash
used for financing activities in 2008 was $2.2 billion. This was primarily comprised of $1.9 billion of share repurchase activity, less the proceeds from the exercise
of stock options; the net repayment of debt of $386 million, almost entirely related to our Euro credit facility; and dividends of $171 million.

Cash
used for financing activities in 2007 was $553 million. This reflects $714 million of net repayments of debt, partially offset by $806 million of new debt
issuances. Share repurchase activity used $751 million and dividend payments of $176 million were paid to shareholders.

Cash and Investments

At December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $639 million, a decrease
of $627 million from December 31, 2008. Of the total balance recorded at December 31, 2009, approximately $85 million was restricted as to use. At December 31, 2009,
$199 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held in the U.S. and $440 million was held by our subsidiaries in other countries. Due to
differences in tax rates, the repatriation of funds from certain countries into the U.S. could have an unfavorable tax impact.

In
our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriter. We
also collect
claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of fiduciary assets and liabilities can fluctuate
significantly, depending on when we collect the premiums, claims and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and foreign currency movements. Fiduciary assets, because of their nature, are
required to be invested in very liquid securities with highly-rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. In our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the amount we report for fiduciary
assets and fiduciary liabilities are equal. Our fiduciary assets included cash and investments of $3.3 billion and fiduciary receivables of $7.5 billion at December 31, 2009.
While we earn investment income on the fiduciary assets held in cash and investments, the cash and investments are not owned by us, and cannot be used for general corporate purposes.

As
disclosed in Note 17, "Fair Value and Financial Instruments," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money
market funds. Money market funds are carried at cost as an approximation of fair value. Based on market convention, we consider cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value. These money market
funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We do not believe that there are any market liquidity issues affecting the fair value of these investments.

As
of December 31, 2009, our investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments had a fair value of $2.1 billion and are reported as cash equivalents,
short-term investments or fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position depending on their nature and initial maturity.

Share Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to $4.6 billion of our outstanding common stock. Shares may be
repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. Any repurchased shares
will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2009, we repurchased 15.1 million shares at a cost of $590 million. In 2008, we repurchased
42.6 million shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. In 2007, we repurchased 19.1 million shares at a cost of $751 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in
2005, we have repurchased a total of 105.8 million shares for an aggregate cost of $4.3 billion. As of December 31, 2009, we were authorized to purchase up to $265 million
of additional shares under the current share repurchase program. The timing and amount of future purchases will be based on market and other conditions.

In
January 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which up to $2 billion of common stock may be repurchased from time to time depending on
market conditions or other factors through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will commence under the new share repurchase program upon conclusion of the existing program.

For
information regarding share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of 2009, see Item 5 — "Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" above.

Shelf Registration Statement

On June 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an
indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt, preferred stock, common stock and convertible securities. We have not issued any securities under this registration statement. The availability
of the potential liquidity under this shelf registration statement is dependent on investor demand, market conditions and other factors. There can be no assurance regarding when, or if, we will issue
any securities thereunder.

Credit Facilities

In December 2009, we cancelled our $600 million U.S. bank credit facility, which was due to expire in February 2010, and
replaced it with a $400 million, three-year unsecured revolving credit facility. Sixteen banks are participating in the facility, which is for general corporate purposes, including
a commercial paper backstop. Additionally, at December 31, 2009, we have a five-year €650 million


($937 million
at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) multi-currency foreign credit facility available. At December 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under either facility.

For
both our U.S. and Euro facilities, we are required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated
interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2009.

There
were no changes in our ratings or outlook during 2009.

A
downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility,
and increase our commercial paper interest rates or possibly restrict our access to the commercial paper market altogether. Although we have committed backup lines, we cannot ensure that our financial
position will not be adversely impacted if we were unable to access the commercial paper market.

Letters of Credit

We have outstanding letters of credit ("LOCs") totaling approximately $153 million at December 31, 2009. These letters of
credit are for the benefit of Virginia Surety Company ("VSC") related to a non-performance risk of reinsurers of VSC's worker's compensation business in California, a LOC that secures deductible
retentions for our own workers compensation program, and LOCs to cover the beneficiaries related to our Canadian pension plan scheme, secure one of our U.S. pension plans, and to cover contingent
payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties.

Adequacy of Liquidity Sources

We believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including
capital expenditures and anticipated working capital requirements, for the foreseeable future. Our cash flows from operations, borrowing availability and overall liquidity are subject to risks and
uncertainties. See Item 1, "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Pension
and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA and other regulations and
minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement
benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions.

(2)

In
2007, our principal U.K subsidiary agreed with the trustees of one of the U.K. plans to contribute £9.4 million ($15 million)
per year to that pension plan for the next six years, with the amount payable increasing by approximately 5% on each April 1. The trustees of the plan have certain rights to request that our
U.K. subsidiary advance an amount equal to an actuarially determined winding-up deficit. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated winding-up deficit was
£420 million ($671 million). The trustees of the plan have accepted in practice the agreed-upon schedule of contributions detailed above and have not requested
the winding-up deficit be paid.

(3)

Purchase
obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all
significant terms, including what is to be purchased, at what price and the approximate timing of the transaction. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology
services or for claims outsourcing in the U.K.

(4)

As
of December 31, 2009, we can exit an information technology contract for termination payments of $13 million. However, given the nature of
this contract, we have included it in our contractual obligations table.

(5)

Also
included is a $318 million contract for claims outsourcing in the U.K. We can exit this obligation after 2013 for approximately
$32 million.

(6)

Excludes
a $42 million commitment to purchase additional fixed-maturity securities from PEPS I, as the general partners may decide not to draw
on these commitments.

(7)

Excludes
$61 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due to our inability to reasonably estimate the period(s) when cash settlements
will be made.


Financial Condition

At December 31, 2009, net assets of $5.4 billion, representing total assets minus total liabilities, were essentially
equivalent to the balance at December 31, 2008. Working capital decreased $374 million to $1.3 billion.

Balance
sheet categories that reflected large variances from last year included the following:

•

Cash and short-term investments declined $627 million, resulting primarily from cash used for our
ongoing share repurchase program, funding of our various pension plans, and the acquisition of subsidiaries.

•

Goodwill increased $441 million, due principally to the impact of foreign currency translation and the acquisitions
of several businesses during 2009.

•

Short-term debt decreased $95 million, due principally to the repayment of $100 million in debt
held at one of our formerly consolidated VIEs.

•

Long-term debt increased by $126 million, principally reflecting the issuance of
€500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior unsecured debentures due on July 1, 2014. Most of the net proceeds from the
offering were used to repay $677 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Euro credit facility.

•

Pension and other post employment liabilities increased $195 million, due to lower discount rates used by the
plans, actuarial losses, adverse pension asset performance and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased contributions made to the plans.

Borrowings

Total debt at December 31, 2009 was $2.0 billion, an increase of $31 million from December 31, 2008. On
July 1, 2009, one of our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries issued €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25% senior
unsecured debentures due on July 1, 2014. The principal and interest on the debentures is unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by us. Most of the net proceeds from the offering were used
to repay the $677 million outstanding under our Euro credit facility. During 2009, we repaid $100 million of short-term debt held at one of our VIEs that was fully liquidated
in 2009, and also redeemed and cancelled a portion of our 8.205% Debentures. Our total debt as a percentage of total capital attributable to Aon shareholders was 27.2% and 27.1% at December 31,
2009 and 2008, respectively.


In 1997, we created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust ("Trust"), for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities ("Capital
Securities"). We received cash and 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the "Debentures") to Aon Capital A.
These transactions were structured such that the net cash flows from Aon to Aon Capital A matched the cash flows from Aon Capital A to the third party investors. We determined that we
were not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and, thus reflected the Debentures as long-term debt. During the first half of 2009, we repurchased $15 million face
value of the Capital Securities for approximately $10 million, resulting in a $5 million gain, which is reported in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. To
facilitate the legal release of the obligation created through the Debentures associated with this repurchase and future repurchases, we dissolved the Trust effective June 25, 2009. This
dissolution resulted in the exchange of the Capital Securities held by third parties for the Debentures. Also in connection with the dissolution of the Trust, the $24 million of common equity
of Aon Capital A held by us was exchanged for $24 million of Debentures, which were then cancelled. Following these actions, $687 million of Debentures remain outstanding as of
December 31, 2009. The Debentures are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027 or are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at our option upon the occurrence of certain events.

Equity

Equity at December 31, 2009 was $5.4 billion, an increase of $16 million from December 31, 2008. Net income
of $792 million and stock compensation expense of $209 million in 2009 were almost completely offset by share repurchases of $590 million, a $213 million increase in
accumulated other comprehensive loss, and $165 million of dividends to shareholders.

Accumulated
other comprehensive loss increased $213 million since December 31, 2008, reflecting the following:

•

an increase in the net post-retirement benefit obligation of $413 million, as a result of lower
discount rates, actuarial losses and adverse pension asset performance,

•

an improvement in net foreign currency translation adjustments of $199 million, which was attributable to the
weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies,

•

net unrealized investment losses of $12 million, and

•

net derivative gains of $13 million.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

Premium Financing Operations

In 2008, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the U.S. operations of Cananwill, our premium finance business. This disposition was
completed in February 2009. In connection with this sale, we have guaranteed the collection of the principal amount of the premium finance notes sold to the buyer, which, at December 31, 2009,
was $8 million. Historical losses in this business have been very low since the premium finance notes are generally fully collateralized by the lender's right, in the event of
non-payment, to cancel the underlying insurance contract and collect the unearned premium from the insurance carrier. We do not expect to incur a significant loss related to this
guarantee.

Some
of our U.K., Canadian, and Australian subsidiaries originated short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance their
insurance premium obligations, and then sold these premium finance agreements to unaffiliated companies in whole loan sales. Prior to August 2009, these loans were sold in securitization transactions
that met the criteria for sale accounting. In June and July of 2009, we entered into agreements with third parties with respect to our international premium finance businesses (collectively, the
"Cananwill International Agreements"). As a result of the Cananwill International Agreements, the third parties began originating, financing and servicing


premium
finance loans generated by referrals from our brokerage operations. The third parties did not acquire our existing portfolio of premium finance loans, and as such, we did not extend any
guarantees under these agreements.

Further
details are included in Note 5 "Business Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

At December 31, 2008 and continuing through December 18, 2009, we consolidated the following
VIEs:

•

Juniperus Insurance Opportunity Fund Limited ("Juniperus"), which is an investment vehicle that invests in an actively
managed and diversified portfolio of insurance risks, and

•

Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited ("JCHL"), which provides investment management and related services to Juniperus.

Prior
to December 18, 2009, based on our percentage equity interest in the Juniperus Class A shares, we bore a majority of the expected residual return and losses.
Similarly, our voting and economic interest percentage in JCHL required us to absorb a majority of JCHL's expected residual returns and losses. We were considered the primary beneficiary of both
companies, and as such these entities were consolidated. As of December 18, 2009, our equity interest in Juniperus declined to 38%, and we held a
39% voting and economic interest in JCHL. Based on our holdings, we no longer are considered the primary beneficiary of either entity and have therefore deconsolidated both entities. Prospectively,
their results will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Juniperus
and JCHL had combined assets and liabilities of $121 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31,
2009, we recognized $36 million of pretax income from Juniperus and JCHL. We recognized $16 million of after-tax income, after allocating the appropriate share of net income
to the noncontrolling interests. Our potential loss at December 31, 2009 is limited to our investment in the VIEs, which is $73 million.

We
previously owned the majority economic equity interest in Globe Re Limited ("Globe Re"), a VIE, which provided reinsurance coverage for a defined portfolio of property
catastrophe reinsurance contracts underwritten by a third party for a limited period which ended June 1, 2009. We consolidated Globe Re as we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
In connection with the winding up of its operations, Globe Re repaid its $100 million of short-term debt and our equity investment from available cash in 2009. We recognized
$2 million of pretax income from Globe Re in 2009. Globe Re was fully liquidated in the third quarter of 2009.

During
2009 we continued to see a soft market, which began in 2007, in our retail brokerage product line. In 2007, we experienced a soft market in many business lines and in many
geographic areas. In a "soft market," premium rates flatten or decrease, along with commission revenues, due to increased competition for market share among insurance carriers or increased
underwriting capacity. Changes in premiums have a direct and potentially material impact on the insurance brokerage industry, as commission revenues are generally based on a percentage of the premiums
paid by insureds. Prices fell throughout 2007, with the greatest declines seen in large and middle-market accounts. Prices continued to decline during 2008, although the rate of decline slowed toward
the end of the year. In our reinsurance brokerage product line, pricing overall during 2009 was also down, although during a portion of the year it was flat to up slightly.

Additionally,
beginning in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, we faced difficult conditions as a result of unprecedented disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit
risk and the deterioration of the financial markets. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets have reduced our customers' demand for our retail brokerage and reinsurance
brokerage products, which have negatively hurt our operational results. In addition, overall capacity in the industry could decrease if a significant insurer either fails or withdraws from writing
insurance coverages that we offer our clients. This failure could reduce our revenues and profitability, since we would no longer have access to certain lines and types of insurance.

Risk
and Insurance Brokerage Services generated approximately 83% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009. Revenues are generated primarily through fees paid by clients, commissions
and fees paid by insurance and reinsurance companies, and investment income on funds held on behalf of clients. Our revenues vary from quarter to quarter throughout the year as a result of the timing
of our clients' policy renewals, the net effect of new and lost business, the timing of services provided to our clients, and the income we earn on investments, which is heavily influenced by
short-term interest rates.

We
operate in a highly competitive industry and compete with many retail insurance brokerage and agency firms, as well as with individual brokers, agents, and direct writers of insurance
coverage. Specifically, we address the highly specialized product development and risk management needs of commercial enterprises, professional groups, insurance companies, governments, healthcare
providers, and non-profit groups, among others; provide affinity products for professional liability, life, disability income, and personal lines for individuals, associations, and
businesses; provide reinsurance services to insurance and reinsurance companies and other risk assumption entities by acting as brokers or intermediaries on all classes of reinsurance; provide
investment banking products and services, including mergers and acquisitions and other financial advisory services, capital raising, contingent capital financing, insurance-linked securitizations and
derivative applications; provide managing underwriting to independent agents and brokers as well as corporate clients; provide actuarial, loss prevention, and administrative services to businesses and
consumers; and manage captive insurance companies.

In
November 2008 we expanded our product offerings through the merger with Benfield, a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. Benfield products have been integrated with our
existing reinsurance products in 2009.

In
February 2009, we completed the sale of the U.S. operations of Cananwill, our premium finance business. In June and July of 2009, we entered into agreements with third parties with
respect to our


international
premium finance businesses, whereby these third parties began originating, financing, and servicing premium finance loans generated by referrals from our brokerage operations.

The
1% decline in

Americas

reflects unfavorable foreign currency translation, which more than offset a 1% increase in organic revenue,
driven by strong growth in Latin America and growth in our U.S. Retail operations despite overall economic weakness, partially offset by declines in our Canadian operation.

United Kingdom

commissions, fees and other revenue declined 12% driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a 6% organic
revenue decline, reflecting weak market conditions as well as lower retentions and new business.

Europe, Middle East & Africa

commissions, fees and other revenue decreased 8% driven primarily by unfavorable foreign exchange
rates. The 1% organic decline was principally due to weakness in France, Germany and Ireland, partially offset by growth in the emerging markets of the Middle East and Africa.

Asia Pacific

commissions, fees and other revenue decreased 7%, due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation and a 1% decline
in organic growth driven largely by the negative impact


of
exiting a business in Japan, economic weakness in Asia and political unrest in Thailand, partially offset by growth in New Zealand and certain emerging markets.

Reinsurance

commissions, fees and other revenue increased 48%, due mainly to the Benfield merger, partially offset by unfavorable foreign
currency translation. Organic revenue is even with 2008, as growth in domestic treaty business and slightly higher pricing was offset by greater client retention, and declines in investment banking
and facultative placements.

Operating Income

Operating income increased $54 million or 6% from 2008 to $900 million in 2009. In 2009, operating income margins in this
segment were 14.3%, up 60 basis points from 13.7% in 2008. Contributing to increased operating income and margins were the merger with Benfield, lower E&O costs due to insurance recoveries, a pension
curtailment gain of $54 million in 2009 versus a curtailment loss of $6 million in 2008, declines in anti-corruption and compliance initiative costs of $35 million,
restructuring savings, and other cost savings initiatives.

These
items were partially offset by an increase of $140 million in restructuring costs, $95 million of lower fiduciary investment income, Benfield integration costs and
higher amortization of intangible assets obtained in the merger, and unfavorable foreign currency translation.

Our
Consulting segment generated 17% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009 and provides a broad range of human capital consulting services, as follows:

Consulting Services:

1.

Health and Benefits

advises clients about how to structure, fund, and administer employee benefit programs
that attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting include health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence management, benefits administration,
data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory and elective benefits services.

2.

Retirement

specializes in global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting,
tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration.

3.

Compensation

focuses on compensatory advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive
reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.

4.

Strategic Human Capital

delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational
effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce
training and change management.

Outsourcing

offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration and other employment-related services.

Beginning
in late 2008 and continuing throughout 2009, the disruption in the global credit markets and the deterioration of the financial markets has created significant uncertainty in
the marketplace. The prolonged economic downturn is adversely impacting our clients' financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. While
we believe that the majority of our practices are well positioned to manage through this time, these challenges are reducing demand for some of our services and depressing the price of those services,
which is having an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.

decreased $64 million or 6%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange as well as declines in most major practice
groups. International operations organic revenue was similar to last year.

Outsourcing

revenue declined $23 million, or 11%, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and the previously announced termination
of our contract with AT&T, partially offset by modest growth in Canada.

Operating Income

Operating income was $203 million, a decrease of $5 million, or 2%, from 2008. This decrease was principally driven by a
2% organic revenue decline, higher restructuring costs, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. These declines were partially offset by savings related to the 2007 restructuring
plan, a $20 million gain from the pension curtailment, lower incentive compensation costs, and other cost saving initiatives. Operating income margins in this segment for 2009 were 16.0%, an
increase of 70 basis points from 15.3% in 2008, as the impact of the revenue shortfall was more than offset by a reduction in expenses.

Unallocated revenue

consists of revenue from our equity ownership in insurance investments, Juniperus and JCHL, obtained in the Benfield
merger. No revenue from these investments was recognized in 2008.

Unallocated expenses

include corporate governance costs not allocated to the operating segments and the costs associated with our
ownership of insurance investments. These expenses decreased by $38 million in 2009 from $165 million in 2008, driven by $50 million of costs incurred in 2008 related to the
merger with Benfield, partially offset by additional expenses of $13 million incurred in 2009 associated with our ownership in Juniperus and JCHL.

In
2009, we recognized $36 million of pretax income from Juniperus and JCHL. We recognized $16 million of after-tax income, after allocating the appropriate
share of net income to the noncontrolling interests.

Interest income

consists primarily of income earned on our operating cash balances and miscellaneous income producing securities. It does
not include interest earned on funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $30 million in 2009, a decrease of $64 million from 2008, which was driven primarily by lower
investment balances, the global decline in interest rates and a $26 million decrease in income from our PEPS I investment. In 2008, we had a large investment balance for part of the year due to
cash received as a result of the sale of our CICA and Sterling subsidiaries.

Interest expense

, which represents the cost of our worldwide debt obligations, declined $4 million due primarily to the impact of
favorable foreign exchange rates, which was mostly offset by higher interest rates following the third quarter issuance of €500 million ($721 million at
December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of long-term debt at an interest rate of 6.25%, which replaced debt borrowed under our Euro credit facility.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we
made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.

In
accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those concerning restructuring, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets,
contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The
results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ
from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we used to prepare these consolidated financial
statements.

Restructuring

Workforce reduction costs

The method used to account for workforce reduction costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are
one-time costs. We account for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or we have an
established pattern of paying by a specific formula.

We
estimate our one-time workforce reduction costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the
employees being


terminated.
We recognize these costs when we identify the specific classification (or functions) and locations of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the
termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period. When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we
record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.

Lease consolidation costs

Where we have provided notice of cancellation pursuant to a lease agreement or abandoned space and have no intention of reoccupying it,
we recognize a loss. The loss reflects our best estimate of the net present value of the future cash flows associated with the lease at the date we vacate the property or sign a sublease arrangement.
To determine the loss, we estimate sublease income based on current market quotes for similar properties. When we finalize definitive agreements with the sublessee, we adjust our sublease losses for
actual outcomes.

Fair value concepts of severance arrangements and lease losses

Accounting guidance requires that our exit and disposal accruals reflect the fair value of the liability. Where material, we discount
the lease loss calculations to arrive at their net present value.

Most
workforce reductions happen over a short span of time, so no discounting is necessary. However, we may discount the severance arrangement when we terminate employees who will
provide no future service and we pay their severance over an extended period. Accretion of the discount occurs over the remaining life of the liability.

For
the remaining lease term or severance payout, we decrease the liability for payments and increase the liability for accretion of the discount. The discount reflects our incremental
borrowing rate, which matches the lifetime of the liability. Significant changes in the discount rate selected or the estimations of sublease income in the case of leases could impact the amounts
recorded.

Other associated costs of exit and disposal activities

We recognize other costs associated with exit and disposal activities as they are incurred, including moving costs and consulting and
legal fees.

Asset
impairments may result from large-scale restructurings and we account for these impairments in the period when they become known. Furthermore, we record impairments by reducing the
book value to the net present value of future cash flows (in situations where the asset had an identifiable cash flow stream) or accelerating the depreciation to reflect the revised useful life.

Aon Benfield purchase accounting

We established a restructuring plan related to our acquisition of Benfield ("Aon Benfield Plan"), which includes reductions in staffing
levels and the abandonment of excess facilities. In connection with these restructuring activities and as part of the cost of the acquisition, we established liabilities, primarily for severance and
excess facilities. We finalized our restructuring plans
in the fourth quarter of 2009 and adjusted liabilities where necessary, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill.

Pensions

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the
Netherlands and Canada.


Significant changes to pension plans

Our U.S., U.K. and Canadian pension plans were previously closed to new entrants. Effective January 1, 2009, our Netherlands
plan was also closed to new entrants. In 2007, future benefit accruals relating to salary and service ceased in our U.K. plans. Effective April 1, 2009, we ceased crediting future benefits
relating to salary and service for our two U.S. plans. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain of $83 million in 2009. In 2010 and 2011, we will cease crediting future benefits relating
to service in our Canadian pension plans. We recognized a curtailment loss of $5 million related to the Canadian pension plans in 2009.

Recognition of gains and losses and prior service

We defer the recognition of gains and losses that arise from events such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions,
actual demographic experience and asset performance.

Unrecognized
gains and losses are amortized as a component of pension expense based on the average expected future service of active employees for our plans in the Netherlands and
Canada, or the average life expectancy of the U.S. and U.K. plan members. After the effective date of the plan
amendments to cease crediting future benefits relating to service, unrecognized gains and losses will also be based on the average life expectancy of members in the Canadian plans. We amortize any
prior service costs or credits which arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.

As
of December 31, 2009, the pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements. We amortize unrecognized
actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation ("PBO"). To the extent not offset by future gains,
incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.

The
following table discloses our combined experience loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss, and the estimated 2010 amortization of loss by country
(amounts in millions):

There
was no unrecognized prior service cost at December 31, 2009.

The
U.S. pension plans use the market-related value of assets to determine expected return on assets. As of December 31, 2009, we reported a fair value of pension assets of
$1,153 million, compared with a market-related value of $1,384 million. The market-related value of pension assets does not yet reflect accumulated asset losses of $231 million.
These losses will increase pension expense as they are graded into the market-related asset value and amortized into expense. Prior to being fully recognized, they may be offset by future asset gains.
We reflect 20% of the current year's asset gain or loss in the current year's market-related value, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years.

Our
plans in the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada use fair value to determine expected return on assets.

In
determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyzed investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset
classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered
historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.

The
U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The actual asset allocation at December 31, 2009 was 60% equity
and 40% fixed income securities for the qualified plan.

The
investment policy for each U.K. pension plan is generally determined by the plans' trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K., our target allocation
represents a weighted average of the target allocation of each plan. Further, target allocations are subject to change. In total, as of December 31, 2009, the U.K. plans were invested 51% in
equity and 49% in fixed income securities.

As
of December 31, 2009, the Netherlands' plan was invested 40% in equity and 60% in fixed income securities, and in total the Canadian plans were invested 71% in equity and 29%
in fixed income securities.

Estimated future contributions

We estimate contributions of approximately $381 million in 2010 as compared with $437 million in 2009.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets
acquired as either trademarks, client lists, non-compete agreements, or other purchased intangibles. Our goodwill and other intangible balances at December 31, 2009 were
$6.1 billion and $791 million, respectively, compared to $5.6 billion and $779 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.

Although
goodwill is not amortized, we test it for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. Beginning in 2009, we also test trademarks (which also are not amortized) that were
acquired in conjunction with the Benfield merger for impairment. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of
goodwill or
trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, or a
significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others. No events occurred during 2009 or 2008 that indicate the existence of an impairment with respect to our reported
goodwill or trademarks.

We
perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a "component"). A component of
an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of
that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a
single component.

The
goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its book value. Management must apply judgment in
determining the estimated fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill and trademarks
are deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two uses the calculated fair value
of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The difference between the fair value of the reporting
unit calculated in Step One and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of


the
reporting unit's goodwill. A charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than its implied fair value.

In
determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow ("DCF") model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using
the weighted-average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes
in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which
are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium
over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of
premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry. Based on tests performed in both 2009 and 2008, there was no indication of goodwill impairment, and no further testing was required.

We
review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. There were no
indications
that the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially
impact our results of operations.

Contingencies

We define a contingency as any material condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved. Under
U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for contingencies when a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of
material adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each
individual issue. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue, or changes in approach, such as changing our settlement strategy. We do not recognize gain contingencies until
the contingency is resolved.

Share-based Payments

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that we ultimately expect to vest
during that period. Thus, we have reduced expense for estimated forfeitures. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. When the terms of an award require no additional service, the award is fully expensed at the grant date. When awards are
modified, we account for the incremental shares at the fair market value at the date of modification. Expense recognition begins on the date the service period begins, which can precede or be after
the grant date, depending on the provisions of the award.

Option accounting

We use a lattice-binomial option-pricing model to value stock options granted. Lattice-based option valuation models use a range of
assumptions over the expected term of the options, and estimate expected volatilities based on the average of the historical volatility of our stock price and the implied volatility of traded options
on our stock.


In
terms of the assumptions used in the lattice-based model, we:

•

use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the valuation model. In 2008 and prior
years, we stratified between executives and key employees. Beginning in 2009, after reviewing additional historical data, we changed the valuation model to stratify employees between those receiving
Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP") options, Special Stock Plan options, and all other option grants. We believe that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns.

•

base the expected dividend yield assumption on our current dividend rate, and

•

base the risk-free rate for the contractual life of the option on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
the time of grant.

The
expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding, which is a derived output of the lattice-binomial
model.

Restricted stock unit awards

Employees may either receive service-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") or performance-based awards, which ultimately result in the
receipt of RSUs, if the employee achieves his or her objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We account for service-based awards by expensing the total award
value over the service period. We calculate the total award value by multiplying the estimated total number of shares to be delivered by the fair value on the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures
based on our actual historical experience and consider dividend discounts when determining the fair value of the RSUs. Performance-based RSUs may be immediately vested upon the end of the performance
period or may have a future
additional service period. Generally, our performance awards are fixed, which means we determine the fair value of the award at the grant date, estimate the number of shares to be delivered at the end
of the performance period, and recognize the expense over the performance or vesting period, whichever is longer. These estimates take into account performance to date as well as an assessment of
future performance. These assessments are made by management using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material
impact on the expense recognized.

The
largest performance-based stock plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. The 2007 to 2009 performance period ended on December 31, 2009. The LPP
currently has two ongoing performance periods: 2008 to 2010 and 2009 to 2011. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both the 2008-2010 and
2009-2011 plans would have increased our 2009 expense by approximately $4 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately
$4 million. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense.

Income Taxes

We earn income in numerous foreign countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries, as
well as U.S. federal and state tax laws. The estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or discrete item
recognized, or expected to be recognized, in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or discrete
item. We consider the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be such items.

The
carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies, and are based on management's assumptions and estimates
about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.


We
assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a "more likely than not" determination. We have not recognized a U.S. deferred
tax liability for undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of our continuing operations to the extent they are
considered permanently reinvested. Distributions may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes if we either distribute these earnings, or we are deemed to have distributed these earnings, according
to the Internal Revenue Code, and could materially affect our future effective tax rate.

We
base the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable on management's interpretation of applicable tax laws, and incorporate management's assumptions and
judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those which deploy tax
planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.

We
operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existing
industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized
through negotiations. In addition, several factors could increase the future level of uncertainty over our tax liabilities, including the following:

•

the portion of our overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing, and we anticipate this
trend will continue,

•

to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently, our subsidiaries frequently enter into
transactions with affiliates, which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and are frequently reviewed by tax authorities,

•

we may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed, and it may be
difficult to secure adequate professional guidance, and

•

tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties change frequently, requiring us to modify existing tax strategies to
conform to such changes.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contains a
summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if
determinable.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to
changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial
instruments for trading purposes.

The
following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. See Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices"
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.

We
are subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our primary exposures are to the Euro, British
Pound, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar. We use over-the-counter ("OTC") options and forward


contracts
to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations' financial statements.

Additionally,
some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiary earned approximately 41% of its
2009 revenue in U.S. dollars and 10% of its revenue in Euros, but most of its expenses are incurred in Pounds Sterling. Our policy is to convert into Pounds Sterling sufficient U.S. Dollar and Euro
revenue to fund the subsidiary's Pound Sterling expenses using OTC options and forward exchange contracts. At
December 31, 2009, we have hedged 53% and 49% of our U.K. subsidiaries' expected U.S. Dollar transaction exposure for the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. In
addition, we have hedged 37% and 59% of our U.K. subsidiaries' expected Euro transaction exposures for the same time periods. We do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years.

We
also use forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated inter-company notes.

The
potential loss in future earnings from market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be
$35 million and $45 million at December 31, 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Our
businesses' income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates
and as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and on the continent of
Europe. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $29 million and
$41 million to 2010 and 2011 pretax income, respectively. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase, net of derivative
positions, of $33 million and $41 million to 2010 and 2011 pretax income, respectively.

We
have long-term debt outstanding with a fair market value of $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This fair value
was greater than the carrying value by $88 million at December 31, 2009, and $296 million less than the carrying value at December 31, 2008. A hypothetical 1% increase or
decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by approximately 5% and 3% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

PEPS I —

At December 31, 2009, a 10% or 20% decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnerships
would have decreased the value of the preferred stock securities by $8 million and $15 million, respectively.

We
have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not
predicting market events. We believe these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible within a one-year period.


Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Financial Statements

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

Aon Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aon Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Aon Corporation at December 31, 2009
and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2009 the Company changed its method of accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Aon Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("U.S. GAAP"). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aon Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("VIEs") for which Aon is
considered to be the primary beneficiary ("Aon" or the "Company"). The consolidated financial statements exclude special-purpose entities ("SPEs") considered VIEs for which Aon is not the primary
beneficiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Management
has reviewed all material subsequent events through February 26, 2010, the date the financial statements were issued, to determine whether any event required either
recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years' consolidated financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2009
presentation, including the reclassification of income earned on non-fiduciary operating funds to Interest income from Investment income, a component of Total revenue, and the
reclassification of equity earnings on investments to Other income (expense) from Commissions, fees and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Following
these reclassifications, Total revenue decreased by $103 million and $125 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, Other general expenses increased by
$1 million in 2008 and decreased $2 million in 2007, Other income (expense) increased by $10 million and $23 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and Interest income
increased by $94 million and $100 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of reserves and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgments. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using
historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when
facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency movements have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the
economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.


2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices

Revenue Recognition

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment revenues include insurance commissions and fees for services rendered and investment
income on funds held on behalf of clients. Revenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable. The Company considers revenues to be realized or realizable when there is persuasive evidence
of an arrangement with a client, there is a fixed and determinable price, services have been rendered, and collectability is reasonably assured. For brokerage commissions, revenue is typically
considered to be realized or realizable at the completion of the placement process, which generally occurs at the later of the effective date of the policy or when the client is billed. Commission
revenues are recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Commissions on premiums billed
directly by insurance carriers are recognized as revenue when the Company has sufficient information to determine the amount that it is owed, which may not occur until cash is received from the
insurance carrier. In instances when commissions relate to policy premiums that are billed in installments, revenue is recognized when the Company has sufficient information to determine the
appropriate billing and the associated commission. Fees for services provided to clients are recognized ratably over the period that the services are rendered.

Consulting
segment revenues consist primarily of fees paid by clients for consulting advice, commissions from insurance carriers for the placement of individual and group contracts, and
outsourcing contracts. Commissions from insurance companies are recognized in the same manner as the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. Fees paid by clients are typically charged on an
hourly, project or fixed fee basis. Revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed, which is measured by the
amount of time incurred. Revenues from fixed-fee contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as a
component of revenues.

Investment
income is recognized as it is earned.

Stock Compensation Costs

The Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and
restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), as well as employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on estimated fair value. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized during the period is
based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Because stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates.

Retirement Benefits

The Company records annual expenses relating to its pension benefits and other post-employment plans based on calculations
that include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset rates of return, inflation rates, mortality rates, compensation increases, and turnover rates. The Company reviews
its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to these assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of the gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are
amortized over future service periods or future estimated lives if the plans are frozen. The funded status of each plan, calculated as the fair value of plan assets less the accumulated projected
benefit obligation, is reflected in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position using a December 31 measurement date.


Income per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available for common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding, including participating securities, which consist of unvested stock awards with non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Diluted net income per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of stock options and awards. The diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the more
dilutive effect of either (1) the two-class method that assumes that the participating securities have not been exercised, or (2) the treasury stock method. Certain common
stock equivalents related primarily to options were not included in the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Aon has included in its diluted
net income per share computation the impact of any contingently convertible instruments regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. Prior to their redemption in November 2007, Aon's
3.5% convertible debt securities, which were issued in November 2002, were able to be converted into a maximum of 14 million shares of Aon common stock, and these shares, and the associated
interest, were included in the computation of diluted net income per share for 2007. Since redemption of these securities, Aon has had no convertible debt securities outstanding.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less. Cash
and cash equivalents included restricted balances of $85 million and $254 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments include certificates of deposit, money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments purchased
with initial maturities in excess of three months but less than one year and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities

In its capacity as an insurance agent and broker, Aon collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commission, remits the
premiums to the respective insurers. Aon also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers are
recorded as fiduciary assets in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity. The obligation to remit these
funds is recorded as fiduciary liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The time frame that the Company holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits
the payment of the premium to Aon and the date Aon is required to forward those payments to the insurer.

Aon
maintained premium trust balances for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies of $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These funds and a corresponding liability are included in fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Aon's policy for estimating allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to receivables is to record an allowance based on a
historical evaluation of write-offs, aging of balances and other qualitative and quantitative analyses. Receivables included an allowance for doubtful accounts of $92 million and
$101 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.


Fixed Assets

Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally calculated using the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Included in this category is internal use software, which is software that is acquired, internally developed or modified solely to meet
internal needs, with no plan to market externally. Costs related to directly obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line
method over a range principally between 3 to 8 years. The weighted-average original life of Aon's software at December 31, 2009 is 4.7 years.

Investments

The Company accounts for investments as follows:

•

Equity method investments

— Aon accounts for limited
partnership and other investments using the equity method of accounting if Aon has the ability to exercise significant influence over, but not control of, an investee. Significant influence generally
represents an ownership interest between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently
adjusted for additional capital contributions, distributions, and Aon's proportionate share of earnings or losses.

•

Cost method investments

— Investments where Aon does
not have an ownership interest of greater than 20% or the ability to exert significant influence over the operations of the investee are carried at cost.

•

Fixed-maturity securities

are classified as available for sale and are
reported at fair value with any resulting gain or loss recorded directly to stockholders' equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred income taxes.
Interest on fixed-maturity securities is recorded in Interest income when earned and is adjusted for any amortization of premium or accretion of discount.

The
Company assesses any declines in the fair value of investments to determine whether such declines are other-than-temporary. This assessment is made
considering all available evidence, including changes in general market conditions, specific industry and individual company data, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been
less than cost, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the entity issuing the security, and the Company's ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery of its
cost basis. Other-than-temporary impairments of investments are recorded as part of Other income (expense) in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in
which the determination is made.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to various
reporting units, which are one reporting level below the operating segment. Upon disposition of a business entity, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity
compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill impairment test is performed
at the reporting unit level and is a two-step analysis. First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its
book value, the Company performs a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit's fair value to determine the fair value of the reporting unit's
goodwill. Fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses.


Intangible
assets include trademarks, customer related and contract based assets representing primarily client lists and non-compete covenants, and marketing and technology
related assets. These intangible assets, with the exception of trademarks, are amortized over periods ranging from 1 to 12 years, with a weighted average original life of 10 years.
Trademarks are not amortized as such assets have been determined to have indefinite useful lives. Similar to goodwill, trademarks are tested at least annually for impairments using an analysis of
expected future cash flows. Interim impairment testing may be performed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable.

Derivatives

All derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value. Where the Company has
entered into master netting agreements with counterparties, the derivative positions are netted by counterparty and are reported accordingly in Other assets or Other liabilities. Changes in the fair
value of derivative instruments are recognized immediately in earnings, unless the derivative is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting.

The
Company has historically acquired the following derivative instruments: (i) a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment ("fair
value hedge"), (ii) a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized variable-rate asset or liability or forecasted transaction ("cash flow hedge"), and (iii) a
hedge of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary ("net investment hedge"). Under hedge accounting, recognition of derivative gains and losses can be matched in the same period with that of the
hedged exposure and thereby minimize earnings volatility.

In
order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow, or a net investment hedge by documenting the
relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation must include a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, Aon's risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge, and the method for measuring hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be
expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Aon assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges and measures and records hedge ineffectiveness, if any, at the end of each quarter.

Fair
value hedges are marked-to-market and the resulting gain or loss is recognized currently in earnings. For a cash flow hedge that qualifies for hedge
accounting, the effective portion of the change in fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI") and subsequently recognized in income when the hedged item
affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. For a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the change in
fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in OCI as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, while the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in earnings.

Changes
in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as an accounting hedge (known as an "economic hedge") are recorded in either Interest income or Other general expenses
(depending on the hedged exposure) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The
Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (2) it determines that the derivative is no
longer effective in offsetting changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows, (3) a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in the time period described in the
hedge documentation, (4) the hedged item matures or is sold, or (5) management elects to discontinue hedge accounting voluntarily.


When
hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as a fair value hedge, the Company continues to carry the derivative in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position at its fair value, recognizes subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative in the Consolidated Statements of Income, ceases to adjust the hedged asset or liability for
changes in its fair value, and amortizes the hedged item's cumulative basis adjustment into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item using a method that approximates the level-yield method.

When
hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the Company continues to carry the derivative in the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position at its fair value, recognizes subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and continues to defer the derivative gain or loss in
accumulated OCI until the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring in the time period described in the hedge documentation or
within a two month period of time thereafter, the deferred derivative gain or loss is immediately reflected in earnings.

Foreign Currency

Certain of the Company's non-US operations use their respective local currency as their functional currency. Those
operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at the current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses
using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of Stockholders' Equity in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in
the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. For those operations that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, transactions denominated in the local currency are measured in U.S.
dollars using the current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and
liabilities are included in Other income (expense) within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The effect of foreign exchange gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income was a loss of
$26 million in 2009 and gains of $18 million and $11 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in these amounts were derivative hedging losses of $15 million in 2009
and $36 million in 2008 and gains of $16 million in 2007.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in
the period when the rate change is enacted.

Deferred
tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax
benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable. The sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary
differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, taxable income in carry-back years and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and
feasible.


The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in
which a change in judgment occurs. The Company records penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

Changes in Accounting Principles

Business Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted revised principles related to business combinations and noncontrolling interests. The
revised principle on business combinations applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control over one or more businesses. It requires an acquirer to recognize the assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. Business combinations achieved in stages
require recognition of the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values when control is obtained. This revision
also changes the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, and requires direct acquisition costs to be expensed. In addition, it provides certain
changes to income tax accounting for business combinations which apply to both new and previously existing business combinations. In April 2009, additional guidance was issued which revised certain
business combination guidance related to accounting for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company has adopted this guidance in conjunction with the adoption of the revised
principles related to business combinations. The adoption of the
revised principles related to business combinations has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The
revised principle related to noncontrolling interests establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
subsidiary. The revised principle clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a separate component of equity
in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The revised principle requires retrospective adjustments, for all periods presented, of stockholders' equity and net income for noncontrolling
interests. In addition to these financial reporting changes, the revised principle provides for significant changes in accounting related to changes in ownership of noncontrolling interests. Changes
in Aon's controlling financial interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions similar to treasury stock transactions. If a
change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary results in a loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value with the gain or loss reported in net
income. In previous periods, noncontrolling interests for operating subsidiaries were reported in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior period amounts have been
restated to conform to the current year's presentation.

The
principal effect on the prior years' balance sheets related to the adoption of the new guidance related to noncontrolling interests is summarized as follows (in millions):

As of December 31



Equity, as previously reported

$

5,310

$

6,221

Increase for reclassification of non-controlling interests



Equity, as adjusted

$

$

6,261

The
revised principle also requires that net income be adjusted to include the net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests and a new separate caption for net income
attributable to Aon stockholders be presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The adoption of this new guidance increased net income by $16 million and $13 million for 2008 and
2007, respectively. Net


income
attributable to Aon stockholders equals net income as previously reported prior to the adoption of the new guidance.

Participating Securities

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new guidance which states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are participating securities, as defined, and therefore should be included in computing basic and
diluted earnings per share using the two class method. Certain of Aon's restricted stock awards allow the holder to receive a non-forfeitable dividend equivalent. The impact of the basic
and diluted net income per share was as follows:

The number of shares excluded from the calculation was 5 million, 3 million, and 5 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.


Fair Value

The Company adopted the following guidance effective April 1, 2009:

•

additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with current principles, when the volume and level of activity
for the asset or liability has significantly decreased. This guidance also assists in identifying circumstances that indicate when a transaction is not orderly.

•

guidance related to debt securities, which requires an entity to recognize the credit component of an
other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the non-credit component in other comprehensive income when the entity does not intend to sell
the security and it is more likely than not that the entity will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery. Entities are required to record a cumulative effect adjustment for the
non-credit component of previously recognized other-than-temporary impairments that meet certain criteria.

•

disclosure guidance related to the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual
financial statements.

The
adoption of the preceding guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

In December 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to current principles regarding employers' disclosures about pensions and other
postretirement benefits. These changes provide guidance as to an employer's disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This amendment requires pension and
other postretirement plan disclosures be expanded to include investment allocation decisions, the fair value of each major category of plan assets based on the nature and risks of assets in the plans,
and inputs and valuation techniques used to develop fair value measurements of plan assets. See Note 13 for these disclosures.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance amending current principles related to the transfers of financial assets and VIEs. This guidance
eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity ("QSPE"), creates more stringent conditions for reporting the transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies other
sale-accounting criteria, and changes the initial measurement of a transferor's interest in transferred financial assets. Former QSPEs will be evaluated for consolidation based on the
updated VIE guidance. There are also changes to the approach a company must take in determining a VIE's primary beneficiary and requires companies to more frequently reassess whether they must
consolidate VIEs. Additional year-end and interim period disclosures will also be required. These changes will be effective for Aon beginning in the first quarter of 2010. The Company
believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
September 2009, the FASB issued guidance updating current principles related to revenue recognition when there are multiple-element arrangements. This revised guidance relates to the
determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple-element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction
consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables. The guidance also expands the disclosures required for multiple-element revenue arrangements. These changes will be
effective for Aon beginning in the first quarter of 2011, and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or modified after the adoption
date. Early adoption is


permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine what impact, if any, it will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In
January 2010, the FASB issued guidance requiring additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. The amended guidance requires entities to disclose additional information
regarding assets and liabilities that are transferred between levels of the fair value hierarchy. This guidance also clarifies existing guidance pertaining to the level of disaggregation at which fair
value disclosures should be made and the requirements to disclose information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements.
These disclosures will be effective for Aon beginning in the first quarter of 2010. The guidance also requires entities to disclose information in the Level 3 rollforward about purchases,
sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis. These disclosures will be effective for Aon beginning in the first quarter of 2011. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine
additional disclosures, if any, that will be required.


3.    Discontinued Operations

Property and Casualty Operations

In January 2009, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell FFG Insurance Company ("FFG"), Atlanta International Insurance
Company ("AIIC") and Citadel Insurance Company ("Citadel") (together the "P&C operations"). FFG and Citadel were property and casualty insurance operations that were in runoff. AIIC was a property and
casualty insurance operation that was previously reported in discontinued operations. The sale was completed in August 2009. A pretax loss totaling $196 million was recognized, of which
$5 million was recorded in 2009 and $191 million in 2008. As part of the sale, the purchaser also assumed an indemnification in respect to certain reinsured property and casualty
balances. The fair value of this indemnification was $9 million at December 31, 2008.

AIS Management Corporation

In 2008, Aon reached a definitive agreement to sell AIS Management Corporation ("AIS"), which was previously included in the Risk and
Insurance Brokerage Services segment, to Mercury General Corporation, for $120 million in cash at closing, plus a potential
earn-out of up to $35 million payable over the two years following the completion of the agreement. The disposition was completed in January 2009 and resulted in a pretax gain of
$86 million. As of February 26, 2010, Aon had not received any of this potential earn-out.

Accident, Life & Health Operations

In April 2008, the Company sold its Combined Insurance Company of America ("CICA") subsidiary to ACE Limited and its Sterling Life
Insurance Company ("Sterling") subsidiary to Munich Re Group. These two subsidiaries were previously included in the Company's former Insurance Underwriting segment. After final adjustments, Aon
received $2.525 billion in cash for CICA and $341 million in cash for Sterling. Additionally, CICA paid a $325 million dividend to Aon before the sale transaction was completed. A
pretax gain of $1.4 billion was recognized on the sale of these businesses, which included the reversal of the cumulative translation adjustment account (related to selling CICA's foreign
entities) of $134 million. In 2009, the Company recognized a $55 million foreign tax credit carryback related to the sale of CICA.


The
operating results of all these businesses are classified as discontinued operations, and prior years' operating results have been reclassified as discontinued operations, as follows

5.    Acquisitions and Dispositions

In 2009, the Company completed the acquisitions of Allied North America, FCC Global Insurance Services and Carpenter Moore Insurance Services
which are included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. The following table includes the aggregate amount paid and the preliminary allocation value of intangible assets recorded as a
result of these and the other acquisitions made during 2009, 2008 and 2007. Due to the timing of these acquisitions, the Company is in the
process of obtaining third-party valuations for the intangible assets other than goodwill that were acquired in 2009, and therefore the allocation of the purchase prices is still subject to
refinement.

The
results of operations of these acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the dates they were acquired. These acquisitions, except for Benfield, would
not produce a materially different result if they had been reported from the beginning of the period.

Benfield

In November 2008, Aon completed the acquisition of the shares of Benfield, a leading independent reinsurance intermediary, with more
than 50 locations worldwide. The Company purchased all of the outstanding shares of common and preferred stock of Benfield for $1,281 million in cash. The total cost of the acquisition also
included direct costs of the transaction totaling $32 million. Benfield is known for its client service, analytic capability and innovation. The results of Benfield's operations were included
in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of closing.

In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded net tangible assets, goodwill and other intangibles which are reported within the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment.
None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Of the acquired intangible assets, $128 million was assigned to registered trademarks, which were determined to have indefinite useful
lives. Of the remaining balance of intangible assets acquired, $449 million was assigned to customer relationships, and $2 million was assigned to non-competition agreements,
which are being amortized over weighted average useful lives of 12 and 1 years, respectively.

Dispositions

In 2009, the Company completed the disposition of its U.S. premium finance business along with a number of smaller entities. The
following table includes the gains or losses recorded as a result of these and other disposals made in 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in millions):

Cananwill

Some of Aon's U.S. ("Cananwill"), U.K., Canadian, and Australian subsidiaries (together "Cananwill International") originated
short-term loans (generally with terms of 12 months or less) to businesses to finance their insurance premium obligations, and then sold these premium finance agreements to
unaffiliated companies, typically bank special purpose entities ("SPE's") in whole loan securitization transactions that met the criteria for sales accounting.

In
December 2008, Aon signed a definitive agreement to sell the U.S. Cananwill operations. This disposition was completed in February 2009. A pretax loss of $7 million was
recorded, of which $2 million was recorded in 2009 and $5 million in 2008, and is included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Aon may receive up to
$10 million from the buyer over the next two years based on the amount of insurance premiums and related obligations financed by the buyer over this period that are generated from certain of
Cananwill's producers. Cananwill's results for the period up to the date of disposition are included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment.

In
connection with this sale, Aon has guaranteed the collection of the principal amount of the premium finance notes sold to the buyer, which, at December 31, 2009, was
$8 million. Historical losses in this business have been very low since the premium finance notes are generally fully collateralized by the lender's right, in the event of
non-payment, to cancel the underlying insurance contract and collect


the
unearned premium from the insurance carrier. The Company does not expect to incur any significant losses related to this guarantee.

In
June and July of 2009, the Company entered into agreements with third parties with respect to Aon's Cananwill International operations. As a result of these agreements, these third
parties began originating, financing and servicing premium finance loans generated by referrals from Aon's brokerage operations. The third parties did not acquire the existing portfolio of Aon's
premium finance loans, and as such, the Company did not extend any guarantees under these agreements.

Aon
recorded gains on the sale of premium finance agreements of $18 million, $55 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and
2007, respectively. These gains are included in Commissions, fees and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Aon
also records receivables in respect of its retained interest in the premium finance agreements sold to the SPE's. These retained interests are recorded at fair value which is
determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using discount rates that are commensurate with the underlying risk, expected future prepayment rates, and credit loss estimates. At
December 31, 2009 and 2008 the balance of retained interests was zero and $99 million, respectively.

Aon
retained servicing rights for sold agreements, and earned servicing fee income over the servicing period. Because the servicing fees represent adequate compensation for the servicing
of the receivables, the Company has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities.

Other Dispositions

During 2009, Aon completed the sale of nine other, smaller operations. Total pretax gains of $15 million were recognized on
these sales, which are included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In
2008, Aon sold four small operations. Total pretax gains of $13 million were recognized on these sales, which are included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.

In
2007, Aon sold three small operations and a 25% share of another small operation, which were all included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. Total pretax gains of
$40 million were recognized on these sales, which are included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

7.    Restructuring

Aon Benfield Restructuring Plan

The Company announced a global restructuring plan ("Aon Benfield Plan") in conjunction with its acquisition of Benfield in 2008. The
restructuring plan is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 700 job eliminations. Additionally,
duplicate space and assets will be abandoned. The Company originally estimated that this plan would result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year
period, of which $104 million was recorded as part of the Benfield purchase price allocation and $81 million of which was expected to result in future charges to earnings. During 2009,
the Company reduced the Benfield purchase price allocation by $49 million to reflect actual severance costs being lower than originally estimated. The Company currently estimates the Plan will
result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $155 million, of which
$55 million was recorded as part of the purchase price allocation, $55 million has been recorded in earnings during 2009, and an estimated additional $45 million will be recorded
in future earnings.

As
of December 31, 2009, approximately 530 jobs have been eliminated under this Plan. Total payments of $67 million have been made under this Plan to date.

All
costs associated with the Aon Benfield Plan are included in the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment. Charges related to the restructuring are included in Compensation and
benefits and Other general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company expects these restructuring activities and related expenses to affect continuing operations into
2011.

2007 Restructuring Plan

In 2007, the Company announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and reduce future expense
growth to better serve clients ("2007 Plan"). The 2007 Plan includes an estimated 4,600 job eliminations. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 3,100 positions have been eliminated. The
Company has closed or consolidated several offices resulting in


sublease
losses or lease buy-outs. The Company currently estimates that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges totaling approximately $750 million. Expenses include
workforce reduction, lease consolidation costs, asset impairments, as well as other expenses necessary to implement the restructuring initiative. Costs related to the restructuring are included in
Compensation and benefits and Other general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company expects the restructuring and related expenses to affect continuing operations
through the first half of 2010.

8.    Investments

The Company earns income on cash balances and investments, as well as on premium trust balances that Aon maintains for premiums collected from
insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies. Premium trust balances and a corresponding liability are included in fiduciary assets and fiduciary liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Financial Position.

PEPS I Preferred Stock

In 2001, Aon sold the vast majority of its limited partnership (LP) portfolio, valued at $450 million, to PEPS I, a QSPE.
The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by Aon (49%) and by a charitable trust, which is not controlled by Aon (51%). Aon does not include the
assets and liabilities or operations of PEPS I in its consolidated financial statements. Approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold by
PEPS I to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid Aon $171 million in cash and issued to Aon an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock
securities.

As
part of this transaction, Aon is required to purchase from PEPS I additional securities equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they are requested. These
securities are rated below investment grade. Aon did not fund any commitments in 2009, but funded $2 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the unfunded commitments were
$42 million. The commitments have specific expiration dates and the partners may decide not to draw on these commitments.

Prior
to 2007, income distributions received from PEPS I were limited to interest payments on PEPS I debt instruments. Beginning in 2007, PEPS I had redeemed or
collateralized all of its debt, and began to pay preferred income distributions to Aon. Whether Aon receives additional preferred returns will depend on the performance of the underlying limited
partnership interests, which is expected to vary from period to period. Aon does not control the timing of the distribution. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, Aon received $6 million, $32 million
and $61 million, respectively, of income distributions from PEPS I, which are included in Interest income.

The
estimated fair value of Aon's preferred stock investments in PEPS I is derived primarily from valuations received for the general partners of the LP interests held by
PEPS I.

On
July 1, 2009, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon issued €500 million ($721 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) of 6.25%
senior unsecured debentures due on July 1, 2014. The payment of the principal and interest on the debentures is unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Aon. Proceeds from the offering
were used to repay the Company's $677 million outstanding indebtedness under its Euro credit facility.

In
1997, Aon created Aon Capital A, a wholly-owned statutory business trust ("Trust"), for the purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities ("Capital
Securities"). Aon received cash and an investment in 100% of the common equity of Aon Capital A by issuing 8.205% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the "Debentures") to Aon
Capital A. These transactions were structured such that the net cash flows from Aon to Aon Capital A matched the cash flows from Aon Capital A to the third party investors. Aon
determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of Aon Capital A, a VIE, and, thus reflected the Debentures as long-term debt. During the
first half of 2009, Aon repurchased $15 million face value of the Capital Securities for approximately $10 million, resulting in a $5 million gain, which was reported in Other
income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. To facilitate the legal release of the obligation created through the Debentures associated with this repurchase and future repurchases, Aon
dissolved the Trust effective June 25, 2009. This dissolution resulted in the exchange of the Capital Securities held by third parties for the Debentures. Also in connection with the
dissolution of the Trust, the $24 million of common equity of Aon Capital A held by Aon was exchanged for $24 million of Debentures, which were then cancelled. Following these
actions, $687 million of Debentures remain outstanding. The Debentures are subject to mandatory redemption on January 1, 2027 or are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the option
of Aon upon the occurrence of certain events.

Certain
of Aon's European subsidiaries have a €650 million ($937 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) multi-currency revolving loan credit
facility. This facility will mature in October 2010. Commitment fees of 8.75 basis points are payable on the unused portion of the facility. At December 31, 2009, Aon had no borrowings under
this facility. At December 31, 2008, €431 million ($605 million at December 31, 2008 exchange rates) was borrowed. Aon has guaranteed the obligations of its
subsidiaries with respect to this facility.

In
December 2009, Aon cancelled its $600 million; 5-year U.S. committed bank credit facility that was to expire in February 2010 and entered into a new
$400 million, 3-year facility to support commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. Based on Aon's current credit ratings, commitment


fees
of 35 basis points are payable on the unused portion of the facility. At December 31, 2009 Aon had no borrowings under this facility.

There
are a number of covenants associated with both the U.S. and Euro facilities, the most significant of which require Aon to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. Aon was in compliance with all debt
covenants as of December 31, 2009.

Outstanding
debt securities are not redeemable by Aon prior to maturity. There are no sinking fund provisions. Interest is payable semi-annually on most debt securities.

Repayments

The
weighted-average interest rates on Aon's short-term borrowings were 1.5%, 4.5%, and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.


10.  Lease Commitments

Aon leases office facilities, equipment and automobiles under noncancelable operating leases. These leases expire at various dates and may contain
renewal and expansion options. In addition to base rental costs, occupancy lease agreements generally provide for rent escalations resulting from increased assessments for real estate taxes and other
charges. Approximately 88% of Aon's lease obligations are for the use of office space.

Valuation
allowances have been established primarily with regard to the tax benefits of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances increased by
$147 million in 2009, primarily attributable to the recognition of the following items: a $75 million valuation allowance for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, a $48 million
increase in the valuation allowance for U.K. capital loss carryforwards, and an $11 million valuation allowance for a German interest expense carryforward. Although future earnings cannot be
predicted with certainty, management believes that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is more likely than not.

Aon
recognized, as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital, income tax benefits attributable to employee stock compensation as follows:
2009 — $25 million; 2008 — $45 million; and 2007 — $40 million.

U.S.
deferred income taxes are not provided on unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested, which at December 31, 2009 amounted to approximately
$2.1 billion. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if all such earnings were remitted to the U.S. due to foreign tax credits and exclusions that
may become available at the time of remittance.


At December 31, 2009, Aon had domestic federal operating loss carryforwards of $7 million that will expire at various dates from 2010 to 2024, state operating loss
carryforwards of $513 million that will expire at various dates from 2010 to 2028, and foreign operating and capital loss carryforwards of $453 million and $252 million,
respectively, nearly all of which are subject to indefinite carryforward.

As
of December 31, 2009, $61 million of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Aon does not expect the unrecognized tax positions to
change significantly over the next twelve months.

The
Company recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. Aon accrued potential penalties of less than
$1 million during each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. Aon accrued interest of $2 million during 2009 and less than $1 million during both 2008 and 2007. As of December 31, 2009
and 2008, Aon has recorded a liability for penalties of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, and for interest of $18 million and $14 million, respectively.

Aon
and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various state and international jurisdictions. Aon has substantially concluded all U.S.
federal income tax matters for years through 2006. Material U.S. state and local income tax jurisdiction examinations have been concluded for years through 2002. Aon has concluded income tax
examinations in its primary international jurisdictions through 2002.


12.  Stockholders' Equity

Common Stock

Aon's Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $4.6 billion of its outstanding common stock. Shares may
be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions, and will be funded from available capital. Any repurchased
shares will be available for employee stock plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2009, Aon repurchased 15.1 million shares at a cost of $590 million. In 2008, Aon repurchased
42.6 million shares at a cost of $1.9 billion. In 2007, Aon repurchased 19.1 million shares at a cost of $751 million. Since inception of its share repurchase program in
2005, the Company has repurchased a total of 105.8 million shares for an aggregate cost of $4.3 billion. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was authorized to purchase up to
$265 million of additional shares under the current stock repurchase program. The timing and amount of future purchases will be based on market and other conditions.

In
January 2010, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which up to $2 billion of common stock may be repurchased from time to time
depending on market conditions or other factors through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases will commence under the new share repurchase program upon conclusion of the
existing program.

In
connection with the acquisition of two entities controlled by Aon's then-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2001, Aon obtained approximately 22.4 million
shares of its common stock. These treasury shares are restricted as to their reissuance.

In
2009, Aon issued 1.0 million new shares of common stock for employee benefit plans. In addition, Aon reissued 8.0 million shares of treasury stock for employee benefit
programs and 0.5 million shares in connection with employee stock purchase plans. In 2008, Aon issued 0.4 million new shares of common stock for employee benefit plans. In addition, Aon
reissued 9.1 million shares of treasury stock for employee benefit programs and 0.3 million shares in connection with employee stock purchase plans. In 2007, Aon issued
0.4 million new shares of common stock for employee benefit plans and 0.1 million shares in connection with employee stock purchase plans. In addition, Aon reissued 9.3 million

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

Aon sponsors defined benefit pension and post-retirement health and welfare plans that provide retirement, medical, and
life insurance benefits. The post-retirement healthcare plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance and pension plans are noncontributory.

The
Company's U.S., U.K., and Canadian plans are closed to new entrants. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company's Netherlands plan was also closed to new entrants. Effective
April 1, 2009, the Company ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service in its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. This change affected approximately 6,000 active employees
covered by the U.S. plan. For those employees, the Company increased its contribution to the defined contribution savings plan. In 2010 and 2011, the Company will cease crediting future benefits
relating to service in its Canadian defined benefit pension plans. This change will affect approximately 950 active employees.

Pension Plans

The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 and a statement of the funded status as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, for the U.S. plans and material international plans, which are


located
in the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada. These plans represent approximately 95% of the Company's pension obligations.

In
2009, a curtailment gain of $83 million was recognized as a result of the Company ceasing crediting future benefits relating to salary and service of the U.S. defined benefit
pension plan. Also in 2009, Aon recorded a $5 million curtailment charge attributable to a remeasurement resulting from the decision to cease service accruals for the Canadian plans beginning
in 2010. In connection with the Company ceasing crediting future benefits relating to salary and service of the U.S. non-qualified defined benefit pension plan, a curtailment loss of
$8 million was recognized in 2008. These items are reported in Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In
2009, a curtailment gain of $10 million was recognized in discontinued operations resulting from the sale of CICA. The curtailment gain relates to the Company's U.S. Retiree
Health and Welfare Plan, in which CICA employees were allowed to participate through the end of 2008, pursuant to the terms of the sale. In 2008, a pension curtailment gain of $13 million was
recognized in discontinued operations resulting from the sale of CICA.

Expected Return on Plan Assets

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the historical performance, investment community
forecasts and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each asset class used by the plans. The expected returns for each asset class are weighted by the target
allocations of the plans.

No
plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during 2010.

Investment Policy and Strategy

The U.S. investment policy, as established by the Aon Retirement Plan Governance and Investment Committee ("RPGIC"), seeks reasonable
asset growth at prudent risk levels within target allocations, which are 42% equity investments, 38% fixed income investments, and
20% other investments. Aon believes that plan assets are well-diversified and are of appropriate quality. The investment portfolio asset allocation is reviewed quarterly and
re-balanced to within policy target allocations. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate by the RPGIC. The investment policies for
international plans are established by the local pension plan trustees and seek to maintain the plans' ability to meet liabilities and to comply with local minimum funding requirements. Plan assets
are invested in diversified portfolios that provide adequate levels of return at an acceptable level of risk. The investment policies are reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate
to ensure that the objectives are being met. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average targeted allocation for the international plans was 46% for equity investments, 49% for fixed income
investments, and 5% for all other types of investments.

Cash Flows

Contributions

Based on current assumptions, Aon expects to contribute approximately $30 million and $351 million, respectively, to its
U.S. and international pension plans during 2010.

Amounts
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost at December 31, 2009 are
$5 million and $14 million of net gain and prior service credit, respectively. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as a component of net
periodic benefit cost during 2010 is $3 million of prior service credit.

Based
on current assumptions, Aon expects:

•

To contribute $5 million to fund other post-retirement benefit plans during 2010 and 2011.

•

Estimated future benefit payments will be approximately $5 million each year for 2010-2011, $4 million each
year for the years 2012-2014 and $20 million in aggregate for 2015-2019.

Aon's
liability for future plan cost increases for pre-65 and Medical Supplement plan coverage is limited to 5% per annum. Because of this cap, net employer trend rates for
these plans are effectively limited to 5% per year in the future. During 2007, Aon recognized a plan amendment which phases out post-65 retiree coverage over the next three years. As a
result, a 1% change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates has no effect on the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement healthcare benefit cost or on the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for the measurement period ended in 2009.

During
2009, the Company converted its stock administration system to a new service provider. In connection with this conversion, a reconciliation of the methodologies and estimates
utilized was performed, which resulted in a $12 million reduction of expense for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Stock Awards

Stock awards, in the form of RSUs, are granted to certain employees and consist of both performance-based and service-based RSUs.
Service-based awards generally vest between three and ten years from the date of grant. The fair value of service-based awards is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock at the date
of grant. With certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause the forfeiture of all unvested awards. Compensation expense associated with stock awards is recognized over the
service period using the straight-line method. Dividend equivalents are paid on certain service-based RSUs, based on the initial grant amount. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
the number of shares available for stock awards is included with options available for grant.

Performance-based
RSUs have been granted to certain employees. Vesting of these awards is contingent upon meeting various individual, divisional or company-wide performance
conditions, including revenue generation or growth in revenue, pretax income or earnings per share over a one- to five-year period. The performance conditions are not
considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. The fair value of performance-based awards is based upon the market price of the underlying common stock at the date of
grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period, and in certain cases an additional vesting period, based on management's estimate of the number of units expected to vest.
Compensation expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares paid out at the end of the programs. The payout of shares under these performance-based plans may range from 0-200%
of the number of units granted, based on the plan. Dividend equivalents are generally not paid on the performance-based RSUs.

During
2009, the Company granted approximately 2 million shares in connection with the completion of the 2006 Leadership Performance Plan ("LPP") cycle. During 2009, 2008 and
2007, the Company granted approximately 3.7 million, 4.2 million and 4.3 million restricted shares, respectively, in connection with the Company's incentive compensation plans.

The
fair value of awards that vested during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $223 million, $107 million and $65 million, respectively.

Stock Options

Options to purchase common stock are granted to certain employees, generally at 100% of market value on the date of grant. Generally,
employees are required to complete two continuous years of service before the options begin to vest in increments until the completion of a 4-year period of continuous employment, although
a number of options were granted that require five continuous years of service before all options would vest. The maximum contractual term on stock options is generally ten years from the date of
grant.

Aon
uses a lattice-binomial option-pricing model to value stock options. Lattice-based option valuation models utilize a range of assumptions over the expected term of the options.
Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of Aon's stock price and the implied volatility of traded options and Aon's stock. In 2008 and prior years, Aon used
historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations within the lattice-binomial option-pricing model, stratified between executives and key employees. Beginning in 2009, after
reviewing additional historical data, the valuation model stratifies employees between those receiving LPP options, Special Stock Plan ("SSP") options, and all other option grants. The Company
believes that this stratification better represents prospective stock option exercise patterns. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company's historical and expected future dividend
rate. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected life of employee stock
options represents the weighted-average period stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.

weighted average assumptions, the weighted average expected life and estimated fair value of employee stock options are summarized as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

United States

Aon has an employee stock purchase plan that provides for the purchase of a maximum of 7.5 million shares of Aon's common stock
by eligible U.S. employees. Under the plan, shares of Aon's common stock may be purchased at 3-month intervals at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first
or the last day of each 3-month period. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, 323,000 shares, 320,000 shares and 405,000 shares, respectively, were issued to employees under the
plan. Compensation expense recognized was $3 million each in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

United Kingdom

Aon also has an employee stock purchase for eligible U.K. employees that provides for the purchase of shares after a 3-year
period and which is similar to the U.S. plan described above. Three-year periods began in 2008 and 2006, allowing for the purchase of a maximum of 200,000 and 525,000 shares, respectively.
In 2009, 2008 and 2007, 201,000 shares, 6,000 shares and less than 1,000 shares, respectively, were issued under the plan. In 2009, $1 million of compensation expense was recognized. In 2008
and 2007, compensation expense recognized was less than $1 million each year.


15.  Derivatives and Hedging

Aon is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the risk related to these
exposures, Aon enters into various derivative transactions that reduce Aon's market risks by creating offsetting market exposures. Aon does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.

Derivative
transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization, counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are
monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity analyses.

Certain
derivatives also give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. The credit risk is generally limited to the fair value of those
contracts that are favorable to Aon. Aon has limited its credit risk by using International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") master agreements, collateral and credit support arrangements,
entering into non-exchange-traded derivatives with highly-rated major financial institutions and by using exchange-traded instruments. Aon monitors the credit-worthiness of, and exposure
to, its counterparties. As of December 31, 2009, all net derivative liability positions were entered into pursuant to terms of ISDA master agreements, and were free of credit risk contingent
features. In addition, Aon has received collateral of $14 million from counterparties and pledged collateral of $1 million to counterparties for derivatives subject to collateral support
arrangements as of December 31, 2009.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Aon and its subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange risk when they receive revenues, pay expenses, or enter into intercompany
loans denominated in a currency that differs from their functional currency. Aon uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts, options and cross currency swaps, to reduce its overall
exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. Aon has hedged these exposures up to six years in the future. Aon has designated foreign exchange derivatives with a notional amount of
$2.0 billion at December 31, 2009 as cash flow hedges of these exposures. As of December 31, 2009, a $14 million pretax loss has been deferred to OCI related to these
hedges, of which a $21 million loss is expected to be reclassified to earnings in 2010. These hedges had no material ineffectiveness in 2009, 2008 or 2007. In addition, as of
December 31, 2009, Aon has $112 million notional amount of foreign exchange derivatives not designated or qualifying as cash flow hedges offsetting these exposures.

Aon
also uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts and options, to hedge its net investments in foreign operations for up to four years in the future. As of
December 31, 2009, the notional amount outstanding was $1.7 billion and no gain or loss has been deferred to OCI related to this hedge. This hedge had no ineffectiveness in 2009, 2008 or
2007.

Aon
also uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts and options, with a notional amount of $54 million at December 31, 2009, to reduce the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of the financial statements of Aon's foreign operations and to manage the currency exposure of Aon's global liquidity profile for one year in the
future. These derivatives are not eligible for hedge accounting treatment.

Interest Rate Risk Management

Aon holds variable rate short term brokerage and other operating deposits. Aon uses interest rate derivatives, typically swaps, to
reduce its exposure to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on the forecasted interest receipts from these deposits for up to three years in the future. Aon has designated interest rate
derivatives with a notional amount of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2009 as cash flow hedges of this exposure. As of December 31, 2009, a $14 million pretax gain has been
deferred to OCI


related
to this hedge, all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings in 2010. This hedge had no material ineffectiveness in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

In
2009, a subsidiary of Aon issued €500 million of fixed rate debt due on July 1, 2014. Aon is exposed to changes in the fair value of the debt due to
interest rate fluctuations. Aon uses receive-fixed-pay-floating interest rate swaps to reduce its exposure to the effects of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the debt. Aon has
designated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of €250 million at December 31, 2009 as a fair value hedge of this exposure. This hedge did not have any
ineffectiveness in 2009.

16.  Variable Interest Entities

Aon did not consolidate any VIEs at December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the following VIEs were
consolidated:

•

Juniperus Insurance Opportunity Fund Limited ("Juniperus"), which is an investment vehicle that invests in an actively
managed and diversified portfolio of insurance risks, and

•

Juniperus Capital Holdings Limited ("JCHL"), which provides investment management and related services to Juniperus.

At
December 31, 2008, Aon held a majority equity interest in the Juniperus Class A shares and bore a majority of the expected residual returns and losses. Aon also had a
majority voting interest in JCHL and absorbed a majority of JCHL's expected residual returns and losses. Aon was considered the primary beneficiary of both companies, and as such these entities were
consolidated. As of December 31, 2009, Aon's interests had been reduced to 38% and 39% for Juniperus and JCHL, respectively and Aon was no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
Consequently, these entities are no longer consolidated by Aon and prospectively will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Juniperus
and JCHL had combined assets and liabilities of $121 million and $22 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Aon recognized $36 million of
pretax income from Juniperus and JCHL for the year ended December 31, 2009. Aon's potential loss at December 31, 2009 is limited to its investment in the VIEs of $73 million,
which is recorded in investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at December 31, 2009.

Aon
previously owned the majority economic equity interest in Globe Re Limited ("Globe Re"), a VIE which provided reinsurance coverage for a defined portfolio of property
catastrophe reinsurance contracts underwritten by a third party for a limited period which ended June 1, 2009. Aon consolidated Globe Re as it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary.
In connection with the winding up of its operations, during 2009 Globe Re repaid its $100 million of short-term debt from available cash. Also in 2009, Aon's equity
investment in Globe Re was repaid. Aon recognized $2 million of pretax income from Globe Re in 2009. Globe Re was fully liquidated in 2009.


17.  Fair Value and Financial Instruments

Accounting standards establish a three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as
follows:

•

Level 1 — observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets;

•

Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, that are
observable either directly or indirectly; and

•

Level 3 — unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the use
of valuation techniques and the development of assumptions.

At
December 31, 2009, Aon's Level 3 fair value measurements primarily consists of its PEPS I investment and guarantees.

The
following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of the Company's financial instruments:

Money market funds and highly liquid debt securities

are carried at cost and amortized cost, respectively, as an approximation of fair
value. Based on market convention, the Company considers cost a practical and expedient measure of fair value.

Other investments

carried at fair value consists primarily of the Company's investment in PEPS I. Fair value is based on valuations
received from the general partners of the limited partnership interests held by PEPS I.

Derivatives

are carried at fair value, based upon industry standard valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or
independently sourced pricing inputs, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, or implied volatilities.

Retained interests

in the sold premium finance agreements of Aon's premium financing operations were recorded at fair value by discounting
estimated future cash flows using discount rates that are commensurate with the underlying risk, expected future prepayment rates, and credit loss estimates.

Guarantees

are carried at fair value, which is based on discounted estimated future cash flows using published historical cumulative
default rates and discount rates commensurate with the underlying exposure.

Debt

is carried at outstanding principal balance. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or estimates using discounted cash flow
analyses based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

18.  Commitments and Contingencies

Legal

Aon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
business, which frequently include errors and omissions ("E&O") claims. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or
extraordinary damages. Aon has historically purchased E&O insurance and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters. Aon has exhausted or materially
depleted its coverage under some of the policies that protect the Company and, consequently, is self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Accruals for
these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are
adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

At
the time of the 2004-05 investigation of the insurance industry by the Attorney General of New York ("NYAG") and other regulators, purported classes of clients filed civil
litigation against Aon and other companies under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") theories. The federal actions were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was
filed in California.
In the New Jersey actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' federal antitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. Aon
believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur
as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Also
at the time of the NYAG investigation, putative classes filed actions against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the federal securities laws
and ERISA. Plaintiffs in the federal securities class action originally submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $353 million to $490 million, and
plaintiffs in the ERISA class actions originally submitted revised purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $74 million to $349 million. To protect against the
uncertain outcome of litigation and to contain exposure to the Company, Aon settled the securities suit for $30 million in 2009 and has reached an agreement in principle to settle the ERISA
suit for $1.8 million. On November 24, 2009, the Court entered a final order approving the settlement and dismissing the securities suit. The proposed ERISA settlement is subject to
documentation, notice and court approval.

Following
inquiries from regulators, the Company commenced an internal review of its compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). In January 2009, Aon Limited, Aon's principal U.K. brokerage subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with the FSA to pay a
£5.25 million fine arising from its failure to exercise reasonable care to establish and maintain effective systems and controls to counter the risks of bribery arising from the use
of overseas firms and individuals who helped it win business. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") continue to investigate these matters. Aon
is fully cooperating with these investigations and has agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current
information, the Company is unable to predict at this time when the SEC and DOJ matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.

A
putative class action,

Buckner v. Resource Life

, is pending in state court in Columbus, Georgia against a former subsidiary of Aon,
Resource Life Insurance Company. The complaint alleges that Resource Life, which wrote policies insuring repayment of auto loans, was obligated to identify and return unearned premiums to
policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled


terms.
In connection with the sale of Resource Life in 2006, Aon agreed to indemnify Resource Life's buyer in certain respects relating to this action. Aon believes that Resource Life has meritorious
defenses, and Resource Life is vigorously defending this action. In October 2009, the court certified a nationwide class of policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled terms
and who Resource Life cannot prove received a refund of unearned premium. Resource Life has taken an appeal from that decision. Also in October 2009, Aon filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court
seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the rights and obligations of Aon and Resource Life under the indemnity agreement. The outcome of the actions, and the amount of any losses or other
payments that may result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Although
the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries, on the basis of
present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such
claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or
annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

Aon provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments
represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible
recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated
amounts payable which are deemed to be probable and estimable are accrued in Aon's consolidated financial statements.

Commitments
associated with Aon's limited partnership securitization are disclosed in Note 8. Guarantees associated with the collection of the principal amount of the premium
finance notes sold to the buyer of the Company's U.S. premium finance business are disclosed in Note 5.

Aon
has total letters of credit ("LOCs") outstanding for approximately $153 million at December 31, 2009. A letter of credit for approximately $91 million is for the
benefit of Virginia Surety Company ("VSC") related to a non-performance risk of reinsurers of VSC's worker's compensation business in California. In connection with the sale of the P&C
operations completed in August 2009, the purchaser agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to replace Aon's LOC related to VSC and to indemnify Aon for any losses suffered by Aon arising out of
this LOC. A letter of credit for approximately CAD 42 million ($40 million at December 31, 2009 exchange rates) was put in place to cover the beneficiaries related to Aon's
Canadian pension plan scheme. A LOC for $12 million secures deductible retentions on Aon's own workers compensation program. An $8 million letter of credit secures one of the U.S.
pension plans. Aon has issued letters of credit to cover contingent payments of approximately $2 million for taxes and other business obligations to third parties. Aon has also issued various
other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at its international subsidiaries for $14 million. Amounts are accrued in the consolidated financial statements to the extent the guarantees are
probable and estimable.

Aon
has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. Costs associated with these guarantees, to the extent estimable and
probable, are
provided in Aon's allowance for doubtful accounts. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $8 million at December 31, 2009.

Aon
expects that as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time.


19.  Segment Information

Aon classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services and Consulting. Unallocated income and expenses,
when combined with the operating segments and after the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses, total to the amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating
segments have been determined using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which Aon's chief operating decision maker uses financial
information for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Aon evaluates performance based on stand-alone operating segment operating income and generally accounts for
intersegment revenue as if the revenue were from third parties and at what management believes are current market prices.

The
Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services business acts as an advisor and insurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, as well as negotiating and placing insurance risk with
insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

The
Consulting business provides advice and services to clients related to health and benefits, retirement, compensation, strategic human capital, and human resource outsourcing.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this annual report of
December 31, 2009. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of December 31, 2009 that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective such that the information relating to Aon,
including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to Aon's management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Aon Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in the

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment, management has concluded our control over financial reporting
is effective as of December 31, 2009.

The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report on page 116.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

No changes in Aon's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a–15(f) of the Exchange Act)
occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Board
of Directors and Stockholders

Aon Corporation

We
have audited Aon Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Aon Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Aon Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial position of Aon
Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009 and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

which is contingent upon the achievement of specified performance goals, called "performance awards."


(5)

Below
are the material features of our equity compensation plans that have not been approved by stockholders:

Aon U.K. Sharesave Scheme

The
Aon U.K. Sharesave Scheme (the "U.K. Scheme") is available solely to employees in the United Kingdom. Under the U.K. Scheme, employees authorize Aon to deduct a specified amount from compensation
each pay period for deposit into a savings account for a three-year term. If a participant's deductions continue through the last day of the term, the participant is credited with a
tax-free cash bonus equal to 1.4 times the monthly payroll deduction. Participants may cease participation in the U.K. Scheme at any time and receive their deductions back, plus accrued
interest. Participants are also granted options at the beginning of each savings period and may direct Aon to purchase or issue shares of Aon common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value
at the beginning of the period, utilizing the accumulated amounts in their account. Options may be exercised generally within six months after the last day of the term, or after death, injury,
disability, redundancy or retirement. If a participant ceases to be employed by Aon for other reasons, or declines to purchase Aon common stock during any of the available purchase periods, the
participant's right to purchase shares of Aon common stock or accumulate additional payroll deductions lapses. The U.K. Scheme was approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. No specific authorization
of shares of Aon common stock for the U.K. Scheme has been made. As of December 31, 2009, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was 121,132.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (The Netherlands)

The
Netherlands Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides employees of Aon and participating subsidiaries in the Netherlands the opportunity to purchase Aon common stock at a 15% discount. Contributions
to this plan are made through payroll deductions. The maximum amount is not more than 15% of gross annual income with a maximum of U.S. $10,000. As of December 31, 2009, the number of shares
that could be issued under the plan was 179 shares.

Aon Supplemental Savings Plan

The
Aon Supplemental Savings Plan (the "Supplemental Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors (the "Board") in 1998. It is a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provides benefits to
participants in the Aon Savings Plan (the "ASP") whose employer matching contributions are limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. Prior to January 1, 2004, participants
covered under the Supplemental Plan were credited with an additional matching allocation they would have received under the former ASP provisions — 100% of the first 1% to 3% of
compensation ("Tier I") and 75% of the next 4% to 6% of compensation ("Tier 2") — had compensation up to $500,000 been considered. Between January 1, 2004 and
December 31, 2005, only participants defined as employees of Aon Consulting's Human Resource Outsourcing Group maintained the matching provision in the Supplemental Plan. Participants may elect
to have Tier I allocations credited to their accounts as if invested in a money market account or as if invested in Aon common stock. Tier I allocations directed to an Aon common stock
account may not be moved to the money market account, regardless of the participant's age. As of January 1, 2006, no participants are eligible for Tier I or Tier II matching
allocations. Before the beginning of each plan year, an election may be made by any participant to transfer some or all of a participant's money market account to the Aon common stock account. All
amounts credited to the Aon common stock account are credited with dividends and other investment returns as under the ASP fund. Between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2008, the
Supplemental Plan provision in effect provided employees hired January 1, 2004 and later, benefits on plan compensation above the IRS limits (and up to $500,000) as under the Aon Retirement
Account (the "ARA") provision of the


ASP.
Benefits were in the form of a discretionary non-contributory company contribution made to eligible employees active at the end of the plan year with 1,000 or more hours of paid
service. The Supplemental Plan ARA allocation was calculated using the same formula that the Board determines for the ASP ARA. Ongoing balances which resulted from the Supplemental Plan ARA allocation
will continue to track the same investment options as selected by the participant under the ASP. This includes the Aon common stock option, and, like the ASP provision, has no transfer restrictions.

Effective
for plan years beginning January 1, 2009, a new Supplemental Plan provision went into effect whereby employees were credited with an additional matching allocation they would have
received under the new ASP match provision — 100% of the first 6% of compensation — had compensation up to $500,000 been considered. Participants must also
contribute the limit prescribed by the IRS ($16,500 for 2009) and be active on the last day of the year in order to receive the allocation. As of December 31, 2009, the number of shares that
could be issued under the plan was 571,226.

Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The
Aon Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan was a plan established in 1989 as a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan that provided benefits to participants in the Aon Employee Stock
Ownership Plan whose employer contributions were limited because of IRS-imposed restrictions. As of 1998, no additional amounts have been credited to participant accounts, although account
balances are maintained for participants, and credited with dividends, until distribution is required under the plan. Distributions are made solely in Aon common stock. No specific authorization of
shares of Aon common stock for the plan has been made. As of December 31, 2009, the number of shares that could be issued under the plan was 263,653.

Awards to Gregory C. Case Pursuant to Employment Agreement

Pursuant
to the Employment Agreement between Gregory C. Case and Aon, dated April 4, 2005, the terms of which are described in the Proxy Statement under the heading "Executive Compensation" and
are incorporated herein by reference, Mr. Case was granted certain equity compensation awards outside of the Stock Incentive Plan as inducement for his employment with Aon. Those awards
consisted of 125,000 restricted stock units and an option to purchase 325,000 shares of Aon common stock, for a total of 450,000 shares. Of the 125,000 restricted stock units, 50,000 units have been
released.

(6)

The
weighted-average exercise price of such shares is uncertain and is not included in this column.

(7)

None
of these equity compensation plans contain a limit on the number of shares that may be issued under such plans; however, these plans are subject to the
limitations set forth in the descriptions of these plans contained in Note 5 above.

Information
relating to the security owner ownership of certain beneficial owners of Aon's common stock is set forth under the headings "Principal Holders of Voting Securities" and
"Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" in the Proxy Statement and all such information is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 13.    Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.

Aon hereby incorporates by reference the information under the headings "Corporate Governance — Director
Independence" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" in the Proxy Statement.

Item 14.    Principal Accountant Fees and Services.
