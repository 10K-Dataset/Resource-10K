BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE
    STRUCTURE AND OVERVIEW

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. was incorporated under Dutch law
    by deed of incorporation dated October 15, 2009. The
    Company was formed to serve as the new parent holding company
    for certain subsidiaries of LyondellBasell AF S.C.A. From
    January 2009 through April 2010, LyondellBasell AF and 93 of its
    subsidiaries were debtors in jointly administered bankruptcy
    cases in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
    New York. As of April 30, 2010, the date of emergence from
    bankruptcy proceedings, LyondellBasell AF’s equity
    interests in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and
    LyondellBasell Industries N.V. now owns and operates, directly
    and indirectly, substantially the same business as
    LyondellBasell AF owned and operated prior to emergence from the
    bankruptcy cases, including subsidiaries of LyondellBasell AF
    that were not involved in the bankruptcy cases.

Our Company is the successor to the combination in December 2007
    of Lyondell Chemical Company (“Lyondell Chemical”) and
    Basell AF S.C.A. (“Basell”), which created one of the
    world’s largest private petrochemical companies with
    significant worldwide scale and leading product positions.

We are the world’s third largest independent chemical
    company based on revenues and an industry leader in many of our
    product lines. We participate in the full petrochemical value
    chain, from refining to specialized end uses of petrochemical
    products, and we believe that our vertically integrated
    facilities, broad product portfolio, manufacturing flexibility,
    superior technology base and operational excellence allow us to
    extract value across the full value chain.

Olefins
    and Polyolefins Segments Generally

We are a top worldwide producer of ethylene, propylene and PE,
    and the world’s largest producer of PP and PP compounds. We
    manage our olefin and polyolefin business in two reportable
    segments, O&P — Americas and O&P —
    EAI.

Ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of
    worldwide production volume and is the key building block for PE
    and a large number of other chemicals, plastics and synthetics.
    The production of ethylene results in co-products such as
    propylene, butadiene and aromatics, which include benzene and
    toluene. Ethylene and its co-products are fundamental to many
    segments of the economy, including the production of consumer
    products, packaging, housing and automotive components and other
    durable and nondurable goods.

Polyolefins are thermoplastics and comprise approximately
    two-thirds of worldwide thermoplastics demand. Since their
    industrial commercialization, thermoplastics have found
    wide-ranging applications and continue to replace traditional
    materials such as metal, glass, paper and wood. Our products are
    used in consumer, automotive and industrial applications ranging
    from food and beverage packaging to housewares and construction
    materials. PE is the most widely used thermoplastic, measured on
    a production capacity basis. We produce HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE and
    metallocene linear low density polyethylene. PP is the single
    largest polyolefin product produced worldwide, and we produce
    homopolymer, impact copolymer, random copolymer and metallocene
    PP.



We specialize in several specialty product lines: PP compounds;

Catalloy

process resins; and

PB-1,

focusing on specialty polyolefins and compounds that offer a
    wide range of performance characteristics. Typical properties of
    such specialty polyolefins and compounds include
    impact-stiffness balance, scratch resistance, soft touch and
    heat scalability. End uses include automotive and industrial
    products and materials. PP compounds consist of specialty
    products produced from blends of polyolefins and additives and
    are sold mainly to the automotive and home appliances industries.

We are the only manufacturer of

Catalloy

process resins,
    which are our proprietary products. The

Catalloy

process
    resins business focuses on specialty polyolefins that offer a
    wide range of performance characteristics.

Catalloy

process resins compete with a number of other materials,
    such as other PP resins, flexible PVC, ethylene propylene
    rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (“ABS”),
    polycarbonate, metals and reinforced polyurethanes.

Sales of ethylene accounted for approximately 3% of our total
    revenues in 2010. Sales of PP accounted for approximately 18% of
    our total revenues in 2010. Sales of PE (HDPE, LDPE and LLDPE,
    collectively) accounted for 16% of our total revenues in 2010.

Olefins
    and Polyolefins — Americas Segment

Overview

Our O&P — Americas segment produces and markets
    olefins, polyolefins, aromatics, specialty products and ethylene
    co-products. We are the largest producer of light olefins
    (ethylene and propylene) and PP and the third largest producer
    of PE in North America. In addition, we produce significant
    quantities of specialty products. In 2010, our
    O&P — Americas segment generated operating
    revenues of $9.2 billion (excluding inter-segment revenue).

Includes 100% of 1.31 billion pounds of capacity of our
    Indelpro joint venture (described below).

See “Description of Properties” for the locations
    where we produce the primary products of our
    O&P — Americas segment. Annual processing
    capacity as of December 31, 2010 was calculated by
    estimating the average number of days in a typical year that a
    production unit of a plant is expected to operate, after
    allowing for downtime for regular maintenance, and multiplying
    that number by an amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily
    output based on the design raw material mix. Because the
    processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount,
    actual production volumes may be more or less than the
    capacities set forth below. Capacities shown include 100% of the
    capacity of joint venture facilities.

Sales &
    Marketing / Customers

In 2010, no single external O&P — Americas
    segment customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.

We currently produce ethylene at five sites in the U.S. Our
    ethylene production in the U.S. generally is consumed
    internally as a raw material in the production of polymers and
    other derivatives, or is shipped by pipeline to customers. In
    North America, we are a net seller of ethylene.

We currently produce propylene at six sites in the U.S., which
    includes production from the Houston Refinery’s fluid
    catalytic cracker coproduct stream. We use propylene as a raw
    material for production of PO, PP, and other derivatives. The
    propylene production within the U.S. that is not consumed
    internally is generally sold under multi-year contracts. In
    North America, we are a net seller of propylene.



We have butadiene and aromatics (benzene and toluene) production
    capabilities at two sites in the U.S. We generally sell our
    butadiene under multi-year contracts. We use the benzene as a
    raw material for production of styrene. In the U.S., we are a
    net purchaser of benzene. Our Refining & Oxyfuels
    business uses the toluene to blend into gasoline. Of the toluene
    production that is not consumed internally, a majority is sold
    on a spot basis.

We at times purchase ethylene, propylene, benzene and butadiene
    for resale, when necessary, to satisfy customer demand for these
    products above production levels. Volumes of ethylene,
    propylene, benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary
    significantly from period to period. However, purchased volumes
    have not historically had a significant impact on profits.

In the U.S., most of the ethylene and propylene production of
    our Channelview, Corpus Christi and La Porte facilities is
    shipped via a pipeline system, which has connections to numerous
    U.S. Gulf Coast consumers. This pipeline system, some of
    which is owned and some of which is leased, extends from Corpus
    Christi to Mont Belvieu to Port Arthur, Texas, as well as into
    the Lake Charles, Louisiana area. In addition, exchange
    agreements with other ethylene and co-products producers allow
    access to customers who are not directly connected to this
    pipeline system. Some ethylene is shipped by rail car from
    Clinton, Iowa to Morris, Illinois and also to customers. A
    pipeline owned and operated by an unrelated party is used to
    transport ethylene from Morris, Illinois to Tuscola, Illinois
    and is used as a raw material in the production of ethanol. Some
    propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel. Butadiene, benzene,
    toluene and other products are distributed by pipeline, rail
    car, truck, barge or ocean going vessel.

We produce PP at three sites in North America, one of which is
    owned by our Mexican joint venture, and one site in South
    America. We manufacture PE using a variety of technologies at
    six sites in the U.S. Our PP and PE production is typically
    sold to an extensive base of established customers under annual
    contracts or under customary terms and conditions without formal
    contracts. We also sell PP into our PP compounds business, which
    is managed worldwide by our O&P — EAI segment. We
    also have a facility in Ohio that produces performance polymer
    products, which include enhanced grades of PE. We believe that,
    over a business cycle, average selling prices and profit margins
    for specialty polymers tend to be higher than average selling
    prices and profit margins for higher-volume commodity PEs.

The majority of our polyolefin products sold in North America
    are sold through our sales organization. We have regional sales
    offices in various locations throughout the
    U.S. Polyolefins primarily are distributed in North America
    by rail car or truck.

Indelpro’s output is marketed by the joint venture.
    Indelpro’s annual capacity includes 770 million pounds
    produced from our

Spherizone

process technology. We
    receive equity distributions and revenues from technology
    licensing and catalyst sales from the joint venture. Further, we
    believe the geographic diversification provides benefits to our
    Company.

We also have a limited partnership with respect to our LaPorte,
    Texas olefin facility. The partnership produces ethylene and
    propylene. Our partner’s partnership interest entitles it
    to 500 million pounds of propylene annually. Our
    partnership interest entitles us to receive all remaining
    ethylene and propylene production, as well as other products
    produced.



Raw
    Materials

Raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for
    the production of ethylene and its co-products. The primary raw
    materials used are heavy liquids and natural gas liquids
    (“NGLs”). Heavy liquids include crude oil-based
    naphtha and gas oil, as well as condensate, a very light crude
    oil resulting from natural gas production (collectively referred
    to as “heavy liquids”). NGLs include ethane, propane
    and butane. The use of heavy liquid raw materials results in the
    production of a significant amount of co-products such as
    propylene, butadiene, benzene and toluene, as well as gasoline
    blending components, while the use of NGLs results in the
    production of a smaller amount of co-products.

Historically, facilities using heavy liquids as feedstock have
    generated higher margins than those using ethane. However, in
    recent years ethane has had a cost advantage for use as
    feedstock based on higher crude oil prices relative to NGLs. As
    a result, a plant’s flexibility to consume a wide range of
    raw materials generally will provide an advantage over plants
    that are restricted in processing capabilities over a number of
    years. We have the capability to process significant quantities
    of either heavy liquids or NGLs. We estimate that in the
    U.S. we can process between 35% and 85% NGLs. Changes in
    the raw material feedstock will result in variances in
    production capacities among products. We believe our raw
    material flexibility in the U.S. is a key advantage in the
    production of ethylene and its co-products.

We source our heavy liquids requirements worldwide via a mix of
    contractual and spot arrangements. Spot market purchases are
    made in order to maintain raw material flexibility and to take
    advantage of raw material pricing opportunities. We purchase NGL
    requirements via long term and spot contractual arrangements
    from a variety of sources. A portion of the heavy liquids
    requirements for ethylene production are also obtained from our
    Refining & Oxyfuels segment. Heavy liquids generally
    are delivered by ship or barge, and NGLs are generally delivered
    via pipeline.

In North America, we also purchase large amounts of natural gas
    to be used for consumption (not as a raw material) in our
    business via market-based contractual arrangements with a
    variety of sources.

The principal raw materials used by our polyolefin business are
    ethylene and propylene. During 2010, our North American ethylene
    and propylene production exceeded the North American raw
    material requirements of the polyolefin business of our
    O&P — Americas segment. However, not all raw
    material requirements for ethylene and propylene in this region
    are sourced internally. Our Mexican joint venture, Indelpro,
    receives the majority of its chemical grade and refinery grade
    propylene needs from Pemex, the state owned oil company of
    Mexico, under a long-term contract. We purchase ethylene and
    propylene on a spot and contract basis to meet our internal and
    external demands as needed.

The raw materials for polyolefins and

Catalloy

process
    resins are, in general, commodity chemicals with numerous bulk
    suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices.

Industry
    Dynamics / Competition

With respect to olefins and polyolefins, competition is based on
    price, product quality, product delivery, reliability of supply,
    product performance and customer service. Industry consolidation
    in North America has led to fewer, although larger, competitors.
    Profitability is affected not only by supply and demand for
    olefins and polyolefins, but also by raw material costs and
    price competition among producers. Price competition may
    intensify due to, among other things, the addition of new
    capacity. In general, demand is a function of worldwide economic
    growth, which fluctuates. It is not possible to accurately
    predict the changes in raw material costs, market conditions,
    capacity utilization and other factors that will affect industry
    profitability in the future.

Based on published rated production capacities, we were the
    second largest producer of ethylene in North America as of
    December 31, 2010. North American ethylene rated capacity
    at December 31, 2010 was approximately 72 billion
    pounds per year, with approximately 84% of that North American
    capacity located along the Gulf Coast. At December 31,
    2010, our ethylene rated capacity in the U.S. was
    approximately 9.6 billion pounds per year, or approximately
    13% of total North American ethylene production capacity.



We compete in North America with other large marketers and
    producers for sales of ethylene and its co-products such as Dow,
    ExxonMobil, International Petroleum Investment Company
    (“IPIC”), Shell, INEOS, ChevronPhillips, TPC Group and
    others.

Based on published data regarding PP capacity, we believe that,
    including our proportionate share of the Indelpro joint venture,
    we are the largest producer of PP in North America as of
    December 31, 2010, with a proportionate share capacity of
    3.3 billion pounds, or approximately 17% of the total North
    American capacity. Our largest competitors for sales of PP in
    North America are ExxonMobil, Total, Braskem, Formosa Plastics
    and INEOS.

With respect to PE, we believe that we are the third largest
    producer in North America as of December 31, 2010, with
    5.8 billion pounds per year of capacity, or approximately
    13% of North American capacity. Our largest competitors for
    sales of PE in North America are Dow, ExxonMobil, IPIC, Chevron

    and Polyolefins — Europe, Asia, International
    Segment

Overview

Our O&P — EAI segment produces and markets
    olefins (ethylene and ethylene co-products) and polyolefins. We
    are the largest producer of PP and PE in Europe and the largest
    worldwide producer of PP compounds. We also produce significant
    quantities of other specialty products such as

Catalloy

process resins and

PB-1.

Our
    O&P — EAI segment manages our worldwide PP
    compound business (including our facilities in North and South
    America), our worldwide

PB-1

business, and our

Catalloy

process resins produced in
    Europe and Asia. We have eight joint ventures located
    principally in regions with access to low cost feedstocks or
    access to growing markets. In 2010, our O&P — EAI
    segment generated operating revenues of $12.5 billion
    (excluding inter-segment revenue).

We currently produce ethylene, propylene and co-products at
    three sites in Europe and one joint venture site in the Middle
    East. Butadiene is an important co-product of this production.
    We produce polyolefins (PP and PE) at 19 facilities in the EAI
    region, including 10 facilities located in Europe, four
    facilities located in East Asia, three facilities located in the
    Middle East and two facilities located in Australia. Our joint
    ventures own one of the facilities in Europe, four of the
    facilities in East Asia and three in the Middle East.

PP compounds consist of specialty products produced from blends
    of polyolefins and additives and are sold mainly to the
    automotive and white goods industries. We manufacture PP
    compounds at 15 facilities worldwide (a number of which are the
    same facilities as the polyolefin facilities described above),
    consisting of four facilities in Europe, five facilities in East
    Asia, three in North America, two in South America and one
    facility in Australia.

We produce

Catalloy

process resins at two sites in the
    EAI region, including one in The Netherlands and one in Italy.
    The process is proprietary technology that is not licensed to
    third parties, and as a result, we are the only manufacturer of

Catalloy

process resins.

We produce

PB-1

at one
    facility in Europe. We believe that we are the largest worldwide
    producer of

PB-1,

a
    family of flexible, strong and durable butene-based polymers. A
    majority of the current

PB-1

we
    produce is used in pipe applications and for under-floor heating
    and thermo sanitary systems.

PB-1

is
    being developed to target new opportunities in applications such
    as “easy-open” packaging (seal-peel film),
    construction, fibers and fabrics, compounds, adhesives and
    coatings.

See “Description of Properties” for the locations
    where we produce the primary products of our
    O&P — EAI segment. Annual processing capacity as
    of December 31, 2010 was calculated by estimating the
    average number of days in a typical year that a production unit
    of a plant is expected to operate, after allowing for downtime
    for regular maintenance, and multiplying that number by an
    amount equal to the unit’s optimal daily output based on
    the design raw material mix. Because the processing capacity of
    a production unit is an



estimated amount, actual production volumes may be more or less
    than the capacities set forth below. Capacities shown include
    100% of the capacity of joint venture facilities.

Sales &
    Marketing / Customers

In 2010, no single external O&P — EAI segment
    customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.

We currently produce ethylene at one site in France, two sites
    in Germany, and one joint venture site in the Middle East. Our
    ethylene production is generally consumed internally as a raw
    material in the production of polymers. In Western Europe, we
    are essentially balanced in our ethylene supply and demand.

We currently produce propylene at two sites in France, two sites
    in Germany and the three joint venture sites in the Middle East.
    We use propylene as a raw material for production of PO and PP.
    In Europe, we are a net purchaser of propylene.

We currently produce butadiene at one site in France and one
    site in Germany. We generally sell our butadiene under
    multi-year contracts.

We at times purchase ethylene, propylene, benzene and butadiene
    for resale, when necessary, to satisfy customer demand for these
    products above production levels. Volumes of ethylene,
    propylene, benzene and butadiene purchased for resale can vary
    significantly from period to period. However, purchased volumes
    have not historically had a significant impact on profits.

European ethylene and propylene production is generally either
    fully integrated with, or is transported via pipeline to, our PE
    and PP facilities in Europe.

We produce PP at nine sites in Europe, four sites in East Asia,
    two sites in Australia and two sites in the Middle East. All of
    the sites in East Asia and the Middle East and one of the sites
    in Europe (Poland) are owned by joint ventures.

We manufacture PE at five sites in Europe, including one joint
    venture facility in Poland, and one joint venture site in the
    Middle East.

With respect to PP and PE, our production is typically sold to
    an extensive base of established customers under annual
    contracts or under customary terms and conditions without formal
    contracts. We believe that, over a business cycle, average
    selling prices and profit margins for specialty polymers tend to
    be higher than average selling prices and profit margins for
    higher-volume commodity PPs.

For the O&P — EAI segment, we typically have
    marketing arrangements with our joint venture partners to sell
    and market PP and PE outside the country where such a joint
    venture facility is located.

Polyolefins primarily are distributed in Europe by rail car or
    truck.

We and our joint ventures manufacture PP compounds at five sites
    in East Asia (two of which are owned by joint ventures), four
    sites in Europe, three sites in North America, two sites in
    South America and one joint venture site in Australia. We
    manufacture

Catalloy

process resins at one facility in
    Italy and one facility in The Netherlands. We also manufacture

PB-1

at the
    facility in The Netherlands.

Our regional sales offices are located in various locations,
    including The Netherlands; Hong Kong, China; India; and United
    Arab Emirates. We also operate through a worldwide network of
    local sales and representative offices in Europe, Asia and
    Africa. Our joint ventures typically manage their domestic sales
    and marketing efforts independently, and we typically operate as
    their agent/distributor for exports.

These joint ventures provide us with additional income streams
    from cash dividends, licensing revenues, catalyst sales and
    marketing fees from selling joint venture products, as well as
    geographical diversification and access to local market skills
    and expertise. We generally license our polyolefin process
    technologies and supply catalysts to our joint ventures. Some of
    our joint ventures source cost advantaged raw materials from
    their local shareholders.

We market approximately 70% of the PP produced annually by SPC
    and are currently the exclusive marketer for the PP produced by
    Al-Waha that is sold outside of Saudi Arabia. We also market all
    of BOP’s PP, HPDE and LDPE sales outside of Poland. Our
    PolyPacific Pty. Joint venture markets all of its PP compounds
    production, and we market a portion of the PP produced by
    SunAllomer.

Raw
    Materials

Raw material cost is the largest component of the total cost for
    the production of ethylene and its co-products. The primary raw
    materials used in our European olefin facilities are heavy
    liquids and, for our Saudi joint venture facilities, NGLs,
    including include ethane, propane and butane. The principal raw
    materials used by our polyolefin and

Catalloy

process
    resins businesses are propylene and ethylene. In Western Europe,
    we have the capacity to produce approximately 50% of the
    propylene requirements of our European PP business and nearly
    90% of the ethylene requirements of our European PE business.
    European propylene and ethylene requirements that are not
    produced internally generally are purchased pursuant to
    long-term contracts with third-party suppliers and are delivered
    via pipeline. Prices under these third-party contracts are
    market related and are negotiated monthly, and are generally
    based on published market indicators, normally with discounts.

In our wholly owned operations in Australia, greater than 90% of
    our propylene normally comes from

third-party

refinery grade propylene purchased under

long-term

contracts linked to Saudi or Singapore fuel markers and is
    processed at our integrated splitters located on each
    manufacturing site. Some of our EAI joint



ventures receive propylene from their local shareholders under

long-term

contracts. The remaining supply for the joint ventures is
    purchased from local suppliers under

long-term

contracts and some spot purchases. Our Saudi joint ventures,

Al-Waha,

SEPC and SPC, produce their own olefins utilizing cost
    advantaged Saudi Arabian propane and ethane.

The raw materials for polyolefins are, in general, commodity
    chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at
    competitive prices.

A significant portion of the raw materials for our PP compounds
    are PP and other polymers (primarily

Catalloy

process
    resins). Our PP compounding facilities generally receive their
    PP and other polymers from one of our wholly owned or joint
    venture facilities via truck or rail car. In addition, there are
    four sites (two in Europe, one in North America and one in South
    America) that have both PP and PP compounding operations
    co-located, thereby minimizing product handling.

PB-1

raw
    materials are sourced solely from external supply.

Industry
    Dynamics / Competition

Our ethylene rated capacity in Western Europe at
    December 31, 2010 was approximately 4.2 billion pounds
    per year, or approximately 8% of the 53 billion pounds per
    year of total Western Europe ethylene production capacity. Based
    on these published rated production capacities, we are the
    seventh largest producer of ethylene in Western Europe. In
    Western Europe, key ethylene competitors include INEOS, Dow,
    Polimeri Europa, Total, SABIC, Shell, BASF and ExxonMobil.

Based on published data regarding PP capacity, we believe that
    we are the largest producer of PP in Western Europe as of
    December 31, 2010, with 5.7 billion pounds per year of
    capacity, or approximately 25% of the Western European capacity
    for PP. Our largest competitors for sales of PP are Polimeri
    Europa, Total, SABIC, INEOS and Dow.

Based on published data regarding PE capacity, we believe that
    we are the largest producer of PE in Western Europe as of
    December 31, 2010, with 5.5 billion pounds per year of
    capacity, or approximately 16% of HDPE and LDPE Western European
    capacity. Our largest competitors for sales of PE are
    ExxonMobil, Dow, INEOS, SABIC, Total, Polimeri Europe, and
    Repsol.

We believe we are the largest PP compounds producer in the world
    with 2.3 billion pounds (which includes our proportionate
    share of joint ventures) of installed annual capacity as of
    December 31, 2010. Approximately 54% of our PP compounding
    capacity is in Europe, 20% is in North America, and 26% is in
    the rest of the world (including the capacity of our joint
    ventures). Our competitors for sales of PP compounds are
    Borealis, ExxonMobil, King Fa, Mitsubishi, Mitsui , SABIC,
    Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., Washington Penn and many other
    independent companies.

Our 110 million pound

PB-1

capacity competes with polybutene producers, of which Mitsui is
    the largest, and other polymers, plastomers and elastomers.

Intermediates
    and Derivatives Segment

Overview

Our I&D segment produces and markets PO and its co-products
    and derivatives; acetyls; and ethylene oxide and its
    derivatives. PO co-products include SM and
    C


chemicals (TBA, oxyfuels (which is managed in the
    Refining & Oxyfuels segment), isobutylene and TBHP).
    PO derivatives include PG, PGE and BDO. We believe that our
    proprietary PO and acetyls production process technologies
    provide us with a cost advantaged position for these products
    and their derivatives. In 2010, our I&D segment generated
    $5.5 billion of revenues (excluding inter-segment revenue).

We produce PO through two distinct technologies based on
    indirect oxidation processes that yield co-products. One process
    yields TBA as the co-product; the other process yields SM as the
    co-product. The two technologies are mutually exclusive,
    necessitating that a manufacturing facility be dedicated either
    to PO/TBA or to PO/SM. Isobutylene and TBHP are derivatives of
    TBA. MTBE and ETBE are derivatives of isobutylene and are
    gasoline blending components reported in our
    Refining & Oxyfuels segment. PG, PGE and BDO are



derivatives of PO. PG collectively refers to mono-propylene
    glycol (“MPG”), which is PG meeting
    U.S. pharmacopeia standards, and several grades of
    dipropylene glycol (“DPG”) and tri-propylene glycol
    (“TPG”).

See “Description of Properties” for the locations
    where we produce the primary products of our I&D segment.
    Annual processing capacity as of December 31, 2010 was
    calculated by estimating the average number of days in a typical
    year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate,
    after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance, and
    multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit’s
    optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix.
    Because the processing capacity of a production unit is an
    estimated amount, actual production volumes may be more or less
    than the capacities set forth below. Except as indicated,
    capacities shown include 100% of the capacity of joint venture
    facilities.

Sales &
    Marketing / Customers

In 2010, no single I&D segment customer accounted for 10%
    or more of our total revenues.

We estimate, based in part on published data, that worldwide
    demand for PO was approximately 15.1 billion pounds in
    2010. More than 75% of that volume was consumed in the
    manufacture of three families of PO derivative products:
    polyols, glycols and glycol ethers. The remainder was consumed
    in the manufacture of performance products, including BDO and
    its derivatives.

We produce and deliver our PO and PO co-products through sales
    agreements, processing agreements and spot sales as well as
    product exchanges. We have a number of multi-year processing (or
    tolling) and sales agreements. In addition, Bayer’s
    ownership interest in the U.S. PO Joint Venture, which
    operates four of the U.S. operating units, represents
    ownership of an in-kind portion of the PO production. Bayer also
    has the right to 50% of the production of one of the facilities
    in The Netherlands. Our PO derivatives are sold through
    market-based sales contracts and spot sales. PO sold in the
    merchant market accounted for less than 10% of our total
    revenues in 2010.

Production levels at the PO/SM and PO/TBA co-product facilities
    are primarily determined by the demand for PO and PO
    derivatives. As a result, production levels of SM and TBA and
    its derivatives, isobutylene, TBHP, MTBE, and ETBE is based
    primarily on the demand for PO and PO derivatives and
    secondarily on the relative market demand for the co-products
    and the operational flexibility of our facilities in meeting
    this demand. MTBE and ETBE our reported in our
    Refining & Oxyfuels segment.

Based on published data, worldwide demand for SM in 2010 is
    estimated to have been approximately 56 billion pounds. SM
    accounted for less than 10% of our total revenues in 2010. We
    sell most of our SM production into the North American and
    European merchant markets and to Asian and South American export
    markets through long-term sales contracts and processing
    agreements.



We purchase SM for resale, when necessary, to satisfy customer
    demand above production levels. Volumes of SM purchases made for
    resale can vary significantly from period to period. However,
    purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact
    on profits.

Our I&D segment converts most of its TBA, which is produced
    as a co-product to the PO process, to isobutylene and sells some
    of the TBA into the market. Over half of the isobutylene from
    the I&D segment is reacted with methanol or ethanol to
    produce MTBE and ETBE, which is marketed by the
    Refining & Oxyfuels segment. The remaining isobutylene
    is sold as high purity and purity grade isobutylene by the
    I&D segment. Isobutylene sales accounted for less than 10%
    of our total revenues in 2010.

Sales of our PO, its co-products, and its derivatives are made
    by us, Nihon Oxirane (a joint venture of which we own 40%) and
    their affiliates directly, and through distributors and
    independent agents located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle
    East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region. We have centralized
    certain sales and order fulfillment functions in regional
    customer service centers located in Houston, Texas; Rotterdam,
    The Netherlands; and Hong Kong, China. PO, PG and SM are
    transported by barge, ocean going vessel, pipeline, rail car and
    tank truck. BDO is primarily transported by tank truck and rail
    car.

Acetic acid and VAM are manufactured at a facility in
    La Porte, Texas, and are consumed internally, sold
    worldwide generally under multi-year contracts and sold on a
    spot basis. Acetic acid and VAM are shipped by barge, ocean
    going vessel, pipeline, rail car and tank truck. We have bulk
    storage arrangements in Europe and South America to serve our
    customers’ requirements in those regions. Sales are made
    through a direct sales force, agents and distributors. Sales of
    acetyls, including acetic acid and VAM, collectively accounted
    for less than 10% of our total revenues in 2010.

We estimate, based on published data, that worldwide demand in
    2010 for acetic acid and VAM was 23.3 billion pounds and
    11.4 billion pounds, respectively.

Methanol is produced at a La Porte, Texas facility owned by
    La Porte Methanol Company, our 85% owned joint venture with
    Linde. Each party to the joint venture receives its respective
    share of the methanol production. Our acetyls business uses the
    methanol as a raw material for acetic acid and also sells the
    methanol under annual contracts and on a spot basis to large
    U.S. customers. The product is shipped by barge and
    pipeline.

Ethylene oxide (“EO”) or EO equivalents, and EO’s
    primary derivative, ethylene glycol (“EG”), are
    produced at a wholly owned facility located in Bayport, Texas.
    The Bayport facility also produces other derivatives of EO,
    principally glycol ethers.

EO and EG typically are sold under multi-year contracts, with
    market-based pricing. Glycol ethers and ethanolamines are sold
    primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at market
    prices. EO is shipped by rail car, and its derivatives are
    shipped by rail car, truck, isotank or ocean-going vessel. EO
    and EG sales accounted for less than 10% of our total revenues
    in 2010.

The vast majority of the ethylene derivative products are sold
    in North America and Asia, primarily through our sales
    organizations.

    remaining PO production and all co-product (SM and TBA)
    production. Lyondell Chemical and Bayer have a separate joint
    venture, the PO Technology Joint Venture, through which Bayer
    was granted a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use
    certain of our proprietary PO technology in the U.S. PO
    Joint Venture. Under the terms of operating and logistics
    agreements, we operate the U.S. PO Joint Venture plants and
    arrange and coordinate the logistics of PO delivery from the
    plants. We do not share marketing or product sales with Bayer
    under the U.S. PO Joint Venture.

Lyondell Chemical and Bayer also have a 50/50 joint venture, the
    European PO Joint Venture, for the ownership of the Maasvlakte
    PO/SM plant near Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Each party takes
    in-kind 50% of the PO and SM production of the European PO Joint
    Venture.

Lyondell Chemical’s PO/SM II plant at the Channelview,
    Texas complex was created through a joint venture among Lyondell
    Chemical, BASF and IPIC. Lyondell Chemical retains a majority
    interest in the joint venture and is the operator of the plant.
    As of December 31, 2010, 700 million pounds of SM
    capacity was committed to BASF and IPIC under processing
    arrangements.

In addition to the Nihon Oxirane joint venture shown in the
    table above, we participate in marketing most of the PO capacity
    from a 440 million pound facility in Rabigh, Saudi Arabia
    owned by Sumitomo and Saudi Aramco, through NOC Asia Co. Ltd. in
    which we have a 40% equity interest.

We jointly market all of the PO manufactured by the Ningbo ZRCC
    joint venture.

We also have a multi-year processing agreement, entered into by
    Lyondell Chemical and Shiny, whereby we provide the raw
    materials used to produce PGE at Shiny’s PGE plant in
    Tainan, Taiwan.

Raw
    Materials

The primary raw materials used for the production of PO and its
    co-products and derivatives are propylene, isobutane, mixed
    butane, ethylene and benzene. The market prices of these raw
    materials historically have been related to the price of crude
    oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as market conditions for the
    raw materials. These raw materials are received in bulk
    quantities via pipeline or ocean going vessels.



In the U.S., we obtain a large portion of our propylene, benzene
    and ethylene raw materials needed for the production of PO and
    its co-products and derivatives internally from our crackers.
    Raw materials for the

non-U.S. production

of PO and its co-products and derivatives primarily are obtained
    from unrelated parties. We consume a significant portion of our
    internally-produced PO in the production of PO derivatives.

We consume large volumes of mixed butane for the production of
    PO and its co-products and derivatives. We have invested in
    facilities, or entered into processing agreements with unrelated
    parties, to convert the widely available commodity, normal
    butane, to isobutane. We also are a large consumer of oxygen for
    our PO/TBA plants.

The cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of
    total production cost for PO and its co-products and
    derivatives. Generally, the raw material requirements for these
    businesses are purchased at market-based prices from numerous
    suppliers in the U.S. and Europe with which we have
    established contractual relationships, as well as in the spot
    market. The raw materials for these businesses are, in general,
    commodity chemicals with ready availability at competitive
    prices. Historically, raw material availability has not been an
    issue. However, in order to enhance reliability and
    competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw
    materials, industrial gas and other utilities, we have long-term
    agreements and other arrangements for a substantial portion of
    our production requirements.

The primary raw materials required for the production of acetic
    acid are carbon monoxide and methanol. We purchase the carbon
    monoxide from Linde pursuant to a long-term contract under which
    pricing is based primarily on cost of production. La Porte
    Methanol Company, our 85%-owned joint venture, supplies all of
    the methanol requirements for acetyls production. Natural gas is
    the primary raw material required for the production of methanol.

In addition to ethylene, acetic acid is a primary raw material
    for the production of VAM. For the production of VAM, we obtain
    our entire requirements for acetic acid and ethylene from our
    internal production. In 2010, we used a large percentage of our
    acetic acid production to produce VAM.

Industry
    Dynamics / Competition

With respect to PO, its co-products and derivatives, competition
    is based on a variety of factors, including product quality and
    price, reliability of supply, technical support, customer
    service and potential substitute materials. Profitability is
    affected by the worldwide level of demand along with price
    competition, which may intensify due to, among other things, new
    industry capacity. It is expected that from 2011 to 2012,
    approximately 9% of the 2010 worldwide PO capacity will be added
    in China and Thailand. During the same period, average world
    demand is expected to grow by approximately 6%. However, demand
    is a function of worldwide economic growth, which fluctuates.
    The PO demand growth rate also could be impacted by further
    development of alternative bio-based PO derivatives. It is not
    possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material
    costs, market conditions and other factors that will affect
    industry profitability in the future.

Based on published data regarding PO capacity, we believe that,
    including our share of Nihon Oxirane, Ningbo ZRCC and the
    European PO Joint Venture, we are the second largest producer of
    PO worldwide, with approximately 19% of the total worldwide
    capacity for PO. Our major worldwide competitors for sales of PO
    and its derivatives are Dow and Shell.

Based on published data regarding SM capacity, we believe that
    we are one of the largest producers of SM worldwide, with
    approximately 5% of the total worldwide capacity for SM as of
    December 31, 2010. We compete worldwide for sales of SM
    with many marketers and producers, among which are BASF, Dow,
    INEOS, Shell and Total.

We believe that we are the fourth and sixth largest producer of
    acetic acid and VAM, respectively, each with approximately 4%
    and 5% of the total worldwide capacity as of December 31,
    2010. Our primary competitors include Celanese and BP for acetic
    acid and Celanese, Dow and DuPont for VAM.



Refining &
    Oxyfuels Segment

Overview

Our Refining & Oxyfuels segment refines heavy,
    high-sulfur crude oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast, refines light
    and medium weight crude oil in southern France and produces
    gasoline blending components at several of our olefin and PO
    units. In 2010, our Refining & Oxyfuels segment
    generated operating revenues of $13.5 billion (excluding
    inter-segment revenue).

The Houston Refinery, which is located on the Houston Ship
    Channel in Houston, Texas, has a heavy, high-sulfur crude oil
    processing capacity of approximately 268,000 barrels per
    day on a calendar day basis (normal operating basis), or
    approximately 292,000 barrels per day on a stream day basis
    (maximum achievable over a 24 hour period). The Houston
    Refinery has a Nelson Complexity Index of 11.4. The Houston
    Refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to refine heavy,
    high-sulfur crude oil. This crude oil is more viscous and dense
    than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of
    sulfur and heavy metals, making it more difficult to refine into
    gasoline and other high-value fuel products. However, this crude
    oil has historically been less costly to purchase than light,
    low-sulfur crude oil. Processing heavy, high-sulfur crude oil in
    significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive
    coking, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating and desulfurization
    capabilities, i.e., a “complex refinery.” The Houston
    Refinery’s refined fuel products include gasoline
    (including blendstocks for oxygenate blending), jet fuel and
    ultra low sulfur diesel. The Houston Refinery’s products
    also include heating oil, lube oils (industrial lubricants,
    white oils and process oils), carbon black oil, refinery-grade
    propylene, petrochemical raw materials, sulfur, residual fuel
    and petroleum coke.

The Berre Refinery is designed to run light to medium sulfur
    crude oil and has a current capacity of approximately
    105,000 barrels per day. It produces naphtha, vacuum gas
    oil, liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel,
    bitumen and heating oil. The Berre Refinery provides raw
    material and site integration for our operations in France and
    supports our polyolefin business in Europe. The Berre Refinery
    also provides us with access to significant logistics assets,
    including pipeline access, storage terminals and harbor access
    to the Mediterranean Sea. The Berre Refinery has a Nelson
    Complexity Index of 6.7.

The Refining & Oxyfuels segment also includes gasoline
    blending components such as MTBE, ETBE and alkylate. MTBE and
    ETBE are produced as co-products of the PO and olefin production
    process at four sites located in the United States, France and
    The Netherlands. In 2009, we converted one of our MTBE units at
    Channelview, Texas to ETBE production. We currently have three
    sites that can produce either MTBE or ETBE with a combined
    capacity to produce 59,000 barrels per day of MTBE or ETBE;
    the Company’s total capacity for MTBE or ETBE production is
    75,000 barrels per day. Alkylate is produced at one
    facility located in Texas.

Sales &
    Marketing / Customers

In 2010, no single Refining & Oxyfuels segment
    customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.

In the U.S., we market and sell gasoline (including blendstocks
    for oxygenate blending), jet fuel, heating oil, ultra low sulfur
    diesel fuel, lube oils, coke and sulfur produced at the Houston
    Refinery. These products are sold in large commodity markets.
    The Houston Refinery evaluates and determines its optimal
    product output mix, based on market prices and conditions. As a
    result, we are subject to various risks associated with selling
    commodity products.

Gasoline sales accounted for 9% of our total revenues in 2010.
    The Houston Refinery’s products primarily are sold in bulk
    on the U.S. Gulf Coast to other refiners, marketers,
    distributors and wholesalers at market-related prices. Diesel
    fuel is produced to meet ultra low sulfur specifications for the
    on-road transportation market. Most of the Houston
    Refinery’s products are sold under contracts with a term of
    one year or less or are sold in the spot market. The Houston
    Refinery’s products generally are transported to customers
    via pipelines and terminals owned and operated by other parties.
    Products also are transported via rail car, barge, truck and
    ocean going vessel. In addition to sales of refined products
    produced by the Houston Refinery, we also sell refined products
    purchased or received on exchange from other parties. The
    exchange arrangements help optimize refinery supply operations
    and lower transportation costs. To meet market demands, we also
    from time to time purchase refined products manufactured by
    others for resale to our customers. However, purchased volumes
    have not historically had a significant impact on profitability.

In Europe, the Berre Refinery provides a significant portion of
    the raw materials requirements for our nearby steam cracker. The
    remaining products are sold into local markets under
    market-based sales agreements



or in the spot market. Key customers of the Berre Refinery
    include other refiners, marketers and distributors, and its
    products are primarily transported via pipelines and other
    infrastructure assets owned by us.

MTBE and ETBE are derivatives of TBA, which is a co-product of
    the PO produced by our I&D segment. As described,
    production levels of the TBA derivatives MTBE and ETBE depend
    primarily on the demand for PO and PO derivatives and
    secondarily on the relative market demand for MTBE and ETBE and
    the operational flexibility of our multiple production
    facilities in meeting this demand. Separately, MTBE and alkylate
    are also produced as derivatives of the ethylene co-products
    produced by our O&P — Americas segment. When
    necessary, we purchase MTBE for resale to satisfy customer
    demand for MTBE above our production levels. Volumes of MTBE
    purchased for resale can vary significantly from period to
    period. However, purchased volumes have not historically had a
    significant impact on profitability.

We sell our MTBE and ETBE production under market-based sales
    agreements and in the spot market. We blend our alkylate into
    gasoline and also sell alkylate under short-term contracts and
    in the spot market. Sales of MTBE and ETBE together, and
    alkylate each accounted for less than 10% of our total revenues
    in 2010.

Substantially all refiners and blenders have discontinued the
    use of MTBE in the U.S., partly as a result of governmental
    initiatives to increase use of bio-ethanol in gasoline and to
    reduce or effectively ban the use of MTBE. However, MTBE/ETBE
    demand for gasoline blending remains strong within most of the
    remaining worldwide market. Accordingly, we market MTBE and ETBE
    produced in the U.S. for use outside of the U.S. Our
    MTBE/ETBE plants generally have the flexibility to produce
    either MTBE or ETBE to accommodate market needs.

Japan has opted to use ETBE as a means of meeting its carbon
    dioxide reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, and we
    source a significant portion of Japan’s bio-fuels needs.

Sales of our MTBE, ETBE and alkylate are made by our marketing
    and sales personnel, and through distributors and independent
    agents located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa
    and the Asia Pacific region. We have centralized certain sales
    and order fulfillment functions in regional customer service
    centers located in Houston, Texas; Rotterdam, The Netherlands;
    and Hong Kong, China. We also have long-term contracts for
    distribution and logistics to supply to our customers. MTBE,
    ETBE and alkylate are transported by barge, ocean going vessel
    and tank truck.

Raw
    Materials

The largest source of the crude oil used as a raw material for
    the Houston Refinery in the past several years has been a crude
    supply agreement with PDVSA-Petroleo S.A., a corporation
    organized under the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of
    Venezuela, which terminates in July 2011. During 2010, less than
    half of our crude supply was purchased under the crude supply
    agreement with PdVSA.

Most of the crude oil used as a raw material for the Berre
    Refinery is sourced from North Africa, the Middle East, Russia
    and other areas generally available in the Mediterranean region.

We purchase our ethanol requirements for the production of ETBE
    from regional producers and importers in Europe at
    market-related prices. Additionally, we have entered into a
    supply contract with a Brazilian ethanol producer to supply a
    significant portion of the ethanol used for the manufacture of
    ETBE at our Channelview facility. For further discussion
    regarding the raw materials requirements for the production of
    MTBE, ETBE and alkylate, see “— Intermediates and
    Derivatives — Raw Materials.”

Industry
    Dynamics / Competition

The markets for fuel products tend to be volatile as well as
    cyclical as a result of changing global economic conditions and
    prices for crude oil and refined product prices. Crude oil
    prices are impacted by worldwide economic conditions and
    political events, the economics of exploration and production,
    refined products demand and currency fluctuations. Prices and
    demand for fuel products are influenced by seasonal and
    short-term factors such as weather and driving patterns, as well
    as by longer term issues such as the



economy, energy conservation and alternative fuels. Industry
    fuel products supply is dependent on short-term industry
    operating capabilities and on long-term refining capacity.

With a throughput capacity of approximately 268,000 barrels
    per day (on a calendar day basis), we believe that the Houston
    Refinery is among North America’s largest full conversion
    refineries capable of processing significant quantities of
    heavy, high-sulfur crude oil.

In North America, we compete for the purchase of heavy,
    high-sulfur crude oil based on price and quality. Our crude oil
    supply contract with PDVSA Oil terminates in July 2011, which
    will increase the need for us to purchase crude oil
    competitively on the open market. We began diversifying our
    portfolio in 2010 and expect to continue to purchase some of our
    crude oil from sources other than PDVSA on market-based terms.
    We compete in gasoline and distillate markets as a bulk supplier
    of fungible products satisfying industry and government
    specifications. Competition is based on price and location. Our
    refining competitors are major integrated oil companies,
    refineries owned or controlled by foreign governments and
    independent domestic refiners. Based on published data, as of
    January 2011, there were 148 operable crude oil refineries in
    the U.S., and total U.S. refinery capacity was
    approximately 17.6 million barrels per day.

During 2010, the Houston Refinery processed an average of
    approximately 241,000 barrels per day of crude oil,
    representing approximately 1% of all U.S. crude processing
    capacity.

A crack spread is a benchmark indication of refining margins
    based on the processing of a specific type of crude oil into an
    assumed selection of refined products. The Houston Refinery
    generally tracks the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread, which represents
    the difference between the first month futures price of two
    barrels of Maya crude oil as set by Pemex and one barrel each of
    U.S. Gulf Coast 87 Octane Conventional Gasoline and
    U.S. Gulf Coast No. 2 Heating Oil (high-sulfur
    diesel). The Berre Refinery refining spreads generally track the
    4-1-2-1 Ural reported benchmark spread. This spread is
    calculated by adding the price of one barrel of gasoline to the
    price of two barrels of diesel and one barrel of #6 fuel
    oil and subtracting the price of four barrels of Mediterranean
    crude oil. While these benchmark refining spreads are generally
    indicative of the level of profitability at both the Houston
    Refinery and the Berre Refinery, there are many other factors
    specific to each refinery that influence operating results.

We believe that we are the largest producer of MTBE/ETBE
    worldwide. We compete for sales of MTBE and ETBE with
    independent MTBE producers worldwide and independent ETBE
    producers mainly in Europe. The most significant MTBE competitor
    is Saudi Basic Industries Corp., and the most significant ETBE
    competitors are Repsol, Total, Neste and Braskem. MTBE and ETBE
    face competition from products such as ethanol and other octane
    components. We compete with other refiners and olefin
    manufacturers for sales of alkylate that we do not internally
    blend into gasoline.

Technology
    Segment

Overview

Our Technology segment develops and licenses polyolefin and
    other process technologies and provides associated engineering
    and other services. Our Technology segment further develops,
    manufactures and sells polyolefin catalysts. We market our
    process technologies and our polyolefin catalysts to external
    customers and also use them in our own manufacturing operations.
    In 2010, our Technology segment generated operating revenues of
    $395 million (excluding inter-segment revenue).

Our polyolefin process licenses are structured to provide a
    standard core technology, with individual customer needs met by
    adding customized modules that provide the required capabilities
    to produce the defined production grade slate and plant
    capacity. For licenses involving proven technologies, we
    typically receive the majority of our license fees in cash at or
    before the date of customer acceptance rather than ongoing
    royalties. For these licenses, we generally recognize revenue
    upon delivery of the process design package and the related
    license. Each license agreement includes long-term
    confidentiality provisions to protect the technology. In
    addition to the basic license agreement, a range of services can
    also be provided, including project assistance; training;

start-up

assistance of the plant; and supply of resins from our
    production for pre-marketing by the licensee. We may also offer
    marketing and sales services. In addition, licensees



generally continue to purchase polyolefin catalysts that are
    consumed in the production process, generally under long-term
    catalyst supply agreements with us.

Process
    Technology Licensing

We are a leading licensor of polyolefin process technologies.

Our PP licensing portfolio includes our

Spheripol

and

Spherizone

process technologies as well as

Metocene

technology.

Our PE process licensing portfolio comprises the

Lupotech

T (high pressure tubular process for producing LDPE), the

Lupotech

A (autoclave process mainly for producing
    ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers),

Hostalen

(slurry process for producing multimodal HDPE), and

Spherilene

(gas phase process for producing full-density
    range of LLDPE to HDPE) processes.

In addition, we license a selective portfolio of chemical
    process technologies in the fields of olefin recovery, olefin
    conversion, aromatics extraction and acetyls.

Since 2000, we have sold licenses representing approximately
    25 million tons of polyolefin capacity, which represents
    about 40% of worldwide installed capacity. In 2010, we entered
    into licensing agreements representing about one million tons of
    polyolefin capacity. Process licenses accounted for less than
    10% of our total revenues in 2010.

Our Technology segment also provides technology services to our
    licensees. Such services include safety reviews, training and

start-up

assistance, engineering services for process and product
    improvements and manufacturing troubleshooting.

PP
    Process Technology

We license several PP process technologies, including

Spheripol

,

Spherizone

and

Metocene

.

Our

Spheripol

technology produces homopolymers and random
    copolymers in a single stage and impact copolymers in a
    multi-stage process. We believe that the

Spheripol

process is the most widely used PP production process in the
    world.

The

Spherizone

process, our newest technology,
    commercialized in 2002 and introduced for licensing in 2004, is
    able to produce higher quality PP, novel PP-based polyolefinic
    resins, and a wider product grade range than existing processes
    at similar operating cost. The

Spherizone

process
    introduces a single reactor concept, in which bimodality is
    created within one single reactor operating at different
    conditions between the different zones inside the reactor. The
    final product is a result of an intimate mixing of the different
    property determining phases at a “macro molecular”
    level.

Metocene

PP technology was introduced for licensing in
    2006. This add-on technology for the production of specialty PP
    products is based on using single-site catalyst systems.

Metocene

technology can be adapted to virtually any PP
    process, and its versatility expands the end use product range
    of conventional PP. In 2009, Polymirae became the first licensee
    to commence commercial production of

Metocene

.

PE
    Processes Technology

The different families of PE (HDPE, LDPE and LLDPE) require
    specialized process technologies for production, which are
    available through our broad PE process licensing portfolio. The
    portfolio includes

Lupotech

,

Spherilene

and

Hostalen

process technologies.

Lupotech

T is a high pressure, tubular reactor process
    for the production of LDPE. This high pressure technology does
    not use a catalyst system typical for low pressure processes,
    but rather peroxide initiators to polymerize ethylene and
    optionally VAM for EVA-copolymers. By adjusting the temperature
    profile along the reactor and adding different peroxide
    mixtures, process conditions are modified to produce the desired
    products. The process produces the entire melt flow ratio and
    density range with competitive investment costs and low
    utilities and raw material demand.



Lupotech

A is a high pressure autoclave process using
    peroxide mixture for polymerization and is mainly utilized for
    specialty LDPE and for the production of EVA copolymers with
    high VAM content.

Spherilene

is a flexible gas-phase process for the
    production of the entire density range of PE products from LLDPE
    and MDPE to HDPE. The flexibility of this technology, which is
    demonstrated by a broad portfolio of grades, enables licensees
    to effectively manage the continuously dynamic PE markets at low
    investments costs and very low operating costs.

Hostalen

is a low-pressure slurry process technology for
    the production of high-performance multimodal HDPE grades. This
    is desirable because a different product structure can be
    produced in each stage of the polymerization process, yielding
    products that are tailored for demanding processing requirements
    and sophisticated end use applications such as film, blow
    molding and pipe applications.

Chemical
    Process Technologies

We also offer for licensing a selective number of chemical
    processes, including the group of

Trans4m

processes,
    Aromatics extractions,

Glacido

and

Vacido

technology.

The

Trans4m

portfolio of process technologies offers
    tailored solutions for C4 and higher olefin recovery and
    conversion. These processes include separation, purification and
    skeletal isomerization of the C4 and C5 olefin streams for the
    selective conversion of low-value, mixed olefin streams from
    crackers to isobutylene, isoamylenes, butadiene, isoprene,
    piperylene and Dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). This group of processes
    is complemented by Aromatics extractions technology, which
    enables LyondellBasell to offer a comprehensive portfolio of
    processes to upgrade all olefinic streams from steam crackers to
    higher value products.

Glacido

is a process technology for manufacturing of
    acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol. It utilizes a
    Rhodium-based homogeneous catalyst system.

Vacido

is a
    fixed-bed tubular process for the production of high-quality
    VAM, from acetic acid and ethylene. It utilizes a proprietary
    heterogeneous catalyst system.

Superflex

technology produces propylene and ethylene, and
    is based on a fluidized catalytic reactor. The process
    technology is used for cracking less refined feedstock such as
    coker or fluid catalytic cracking unit light gasoline as well as
    mixed C4 to C9 streams.

Polyolefin
    Catalysts

Under the

Avant

brand, we are a leading manufacturer and
    supplier of polyolefin catalysts. Polyolefin catalysts accounted
    for less than 10% of our total revenues in 2010. As a large
    polyolefin producer, approximately 30% of catalyst sales are
    inter-company. Polyolefin catalysts are packaged and shipped via
    road, sea or air to our customers.

We produce catalysts at two facilities in Germany, one facility
    in Italy and one facility in the U.S. Our polyolefin
    catalysts, which are consumed during the polyolefin production
    process and define the processing and mechanical properties of
    polyolefins, provide enhanced performance for our process
    technologies and are being developed to enhance performance when
    used in third-party process technologies. We also supply
    catalysts for producing sophisticated PEs.

Customers using polyolefin catalysts must make continual
    purchases, because they are consumed during the polyolefin
    production process. New licensees generally elect to enter into
    long-term catalyst supply agreements.

Sales &
    Marketing

In 2010, no single Technology segment customer accounted for 10%
    or more of our total revenues. We market our process
    technologies and catalysts to external customers and also use
    them for our own polyolefin manufacturing operations. We have a
    marketing and sales force dedicated to the Technology segment,
    including catalyst sales and customer technical support for
    licensees.



Industry
    Dynamics / Competition

We believe that competition in the polyolefin process licensing
    industry is based on the quality and efficiency of the process
    technology, product performance and product application,
    complemented by customer service and technical support. Since
    the formation of Basell in 2000 through December 31, 2010,
    we have sold licenses representing approximately 25 million
    tons of capacity based on its six process technologies to
    polyolefin manufacturers. We estimate that approximately 40% of
    PP and 31% of PE worldwide licensed capacity from 2003 through
    2010 use our technologies. As of December 31, 2010, we
    estimate that over 200 polyolefin production lines use our
    licensed process technologies. Our major competitors in PP
    technologies licensing are Dow Chemical, INEOS, Novolene
    Technology Holdings and Mitsui Chemicals. Our major competitors
    in PE technologies licensing are Chevronphillips, INEOS, Mitsui
    Chemicals and Univation Technologies.

We are one of the world’s largest manufacturers and
    suppliers of PP catalysts. We also supply catalysts for
    producing PEs. Our major competitors in the worldwide catalyst
    business are Dow Chemical, BASF, Mitsui Chemicals, Toho Catalyst
    and WR Grace.

Research
    and Development

Our research and development activities are designed to improve
    our existing products and discover and commercialize new
    materials, catalysts and processes. These activities focus on
    product and application development, process development,
    catalyst development and fundamental polyolefin focused research.

We have four research and development facilities, each with a
    specific focus. Our facility in Frankfurt, Germany focuses on PE
    and metallocene catalysts. Our facility in Ferrara, Italy
    focuses on PP,

PB-1,

PP
    compounds and Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Our facility in
    Cincinnati, Ohio focuses on polyolefin product and application
    development in North America. Our center in Newtown Square,
    Pennsylvania develops chemical catalysts and technologies.

Our financial performance and market position depend in
    substantial part on our ability to improve our existing products
    and discover and commercialize new materials, catalysts and
    processes. Our research and development is organized by core
    competence communities that manage and provide resources for
    projects, intellectual property and catalyst manufacturing.
    These include:

•

Catalyst systems:

catalyst research to enhance
    our polyolefin polymer properties, catalyst and process
    performance, including Ziegler Natta, chromium and metallocene
    catalyst.

•

Manufacturing platforms:

    on polymers from production to processability.

•

Process design and support:

research to reduce
    production and investment costs while improving processability.

•

Chemicals and fuels technologies:

research to
    develop and improve catalysts for existing chemical processes
    and improve process unit operations.

•  We have core research and development projects that
    focus on initiatives in line with our strategic direction. These
    projects are closely aligned with our businesses and customers
    with a goal of commercialization of identified opportunities.
    Core projects currently include research and development in
    areas such as:

•

PP product development with emphasis on

Spherizone

process technology.

•

Next generation products from existing and in-development
    processes, using advanced catalyst technologies including
    metallocenes.



•

Enhanced catalyst and process opportunities to extend gas phase
    PE technology.

•

Enhanced catalysts and process opportunities for selected
    chemical technologies.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 915 of our employees
    are directly engaged in research and development activities.

In addition to our research and development activities, we
    provide technical support to our customers. Our technical
    support centers are located in Bayreuth, Germany; Geelong,
    Australia; Lansing, Michigan; and Tarragona, Spain.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, our research and development
    expenditures were $154 million, $145 million and
    $194 million, respectively. A portion of these expenses are
    related to technical support and customer service and are
    allocated primarily to the segments.

GENERAL

Intellectual
    Property

We maintain an extensive patent portfolio and continue to file
    new patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. As
    of December 31, 2010, we owned approximately 6,500 patents
    and patent applications worldwide. Our patents and trade secrets
    cover our processes, products and catalysts and are significant
    to our competitive position, particularly with regard to
    propylene oxide, intermediate chemicals, petrochemicals,
    polymers and our process technologies such as

Spheripol

,

Spherizone

,

Hostalen

,

Spherilene

,

Lupotech

,

Glacido

,

Vacido

,

Isomplus

and

Avant

catalysts. We own globally registered and
    unregistered trademarks including the
    “LyondellBasell,” “Lyondell,”
    “Equistar” and “Houston Refining” trade
    names. While we believe that our intellectual property provides
    competitive advantages, we do not regard our businesses as being
    materially dependent upon any single patent, trade secret or
    trademark. Some of our heritage production capacity operates
    under licenses from third parties.

We rely on patent, copyright and trade secret laws of the
    countries in which we operate to protect our investment in
    research and development, manufacturing and marketing. Our
    employees working on these technologies are required to enter
    into agreements, or are covered by other arrangements such as
    collective bargaining agreements, providing for confidentiality
    and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while
    employed by us.

Environmental

Regulation

We are subject to extensive international, national, state,
    local and environmental laws, regulations, directives, rules and
    ordinances concerning, and are required to have permits and
    licenses regulating, emissions to the air, discharges onto land
    or waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,
    treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and
    waste materials.

Under the European Union (“EU”) Integrated Pollution
    Prevention and Control Directive (“IPPC”), EU Member
    State governments are to adopt rules and implement an
    environmental permitting program relating to air, water and
    waste for individual facilities. The EU countries are at varying
    stages in their respective implementation of the IPPC permit
    program. We do not know with certainty what future IPPC permits
    will require, or the future costs of compliance with the IPPC
    permit program. The EU also has passed legislation governing the
    registration, evaluation and authorization of chemicals, known
    as REACh, pursuant to which we are required to register
    chemicals and gain authorization for the use of certain
    substances. As an importer of chemicals and materials from
    outside the EU, we are subject to additional registration
    obligations.

We also are subject to environmental laws that may have a
    significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of
    contamination at current and former operating facilities and at
    other sites at which hazardous substances generated by our
    current or former subsidiaries were disposed, the costs of
    transportation and storage of raw materials and finished
    products and the costs of the storage and disposal of
    wastewater. In the



U.S., the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
    Liability Act of 1980, as amended and also known as Superfund
    (“CERCLA”), imposes joint and several liability for
    the costs of remedial investigations and cleanup actions, as
    well as damages to natural resources, on entities that generated
    hazardous substances, arranged for disposal of the hazardous
    substances, transported to or selected the disposal sites and
    the past and present owners and operators of such sites. All
    such responsible parties (or any one of them) can be required to
    bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the
    original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. We are
    subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or
    operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been
    disposed or as a generator or transporter of hazardous
    substances disposed at other locations.

Under the EU Environmental Liability Directive, EU Member States
    can require the remediation of soil and groundwater
    contamination in certain circumstances, under the “polluter
    pays principle.” The scope of events and circumstances that
    could trigger remediation requirements and the level of
    remediation required vary from Member State to Member State.

Under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
    1976 (“RCRA”), various U.S. state and

non-U.S. government

regulations regulate the handling, transporting and disposal of
    hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Our manufacturing sites have,
    and may in the future, handle

on-site

waste disposal, subjecting us to these laws and regulations.

Capital
    Expenditures

In some cases, compliance with environmental, health and safety
    laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital
    expenditures. Regulatory-related capital expenditures at our
    facilities were $121 million, $250 million and
    $209 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and we
    estimate such expenditures to be approximately $243 million
    in 2011 and $221 million in 2012.

Our actual capital expenditures in 2010 primarily relate to
    projects designed to reduce and control emissions from our plant
    operations in both the U.S. and Europe.

Stricter environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and
    enforcement policies could result in increased environmental
    capital expenditures by us above current estimates.

Employee
    Relations

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    14,000 full-time and part-time employees. Of these,
    approximately 5,900 were located in North America, approximately
    7,200 were located in Europe and approximately 1,000 were in
    other locations.

As of December 31, 2010, approximately 900 of our employees
    located in North America are represented by labor unions. The
    vast majority of our employees in Europe and South America are
    subject to staff council or works council coverage or collective
    bargaining agreements.

In addition to our own employees, we use the services of
    contractors in the routine conduct of our businesses.

We believe our relations with our employees are good.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in
    addition to the other information included in this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business,
    operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely
    affect the value of an investment in our common stock.

Economic
    downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely
    affect our business and results of operations.

Our results of operations can be materially affected by adverse
    conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic
    conditions generally. Economic downturns in the businesses and
    geographic areas in which we sell our products substantially
    reduce demand for our products and result in decreased sales
    volumes. Recessionary environments adversely affect our business
    because demand for our products is reduced, particularly from
    our customers in industrial markets generally and the automotive
    and housing industries specifically.

Moreover, many of our customers and suppliers rely on access to
    credit to adequately fund their operations. Disruptions in
    financial markets and economic slowdown can adversely impact the
    ability of our customers to finance the purchase of our products
    as well as the creditworthiness of those customers. These same
    factors may also impact the ability and willingness of suppliers
    to provide us with raw materials for our business.

The
    cyclicality and volatility of the industries in which we
    participate may cause significant fluctuations in our operating
    results.

Our business operations are subject to the cyclical and volatile
    nature of the supply-demand balance in the chemical and refining
    industries. Our future operating results are expected to
    continue to be affected by this cyclicality and volatility. The
    chemical and refining industries historically have experienced
    alternating periods of capacity shortages, causing prices and
    profit margins to increase, followed by periods of excess
    capacity, resulting in oversupply, declining capacity
    utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins.

In addition to changes in the supply and demand for products,
    changes in energy prices and other worldwide economic conditions
    can cause volatility. These factors result in significant
    fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and
    over business cycles.

In addition, new capacity additions, especially in Asia and the
    Middle East, are expected to lead to a period of oversupply and
    lower profitability. The timing and extent of any changes to
    currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply
    and demand may be unbalanced at any time. As a consequence, we
    are unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of
    future industry cycles or their effect on our business,
    financial condition or results of operations. We can give no
    assurances as to any predictions we may make with respect to the
    timing, extent or duration of future industry cycles.



Costs
    and limitations on supply of raw materials and energy may result
    in increased operating expenses.

The costs of raw materials and energy represent a substantial
    portion of our operating expenses. Energy costs generally follow
    price trends of crude oil and natural gas. These price trends
    may be highly volatile and cyclical. In the past, raw material
    and energy costs have experienced significant fluctuations that
    adversely affected our business segments’ results of
    operations. Moreover, fluctuations in currency exchange rates
    can add to this volatility.

We are not always able to pass raw material and energy cost
    increases on to our customers. When we do have the ability to
    pass on the cost increases, we are not always able to do so
    quickly enough to avoid adverse impacts on our results of
    operations.

Cost increases also may increase working capital needs, which
    could reduce our liquidity and cash flow. Even if we increase
    our sales prices to reflect rising raw material and energy
    costs, demand for products may decrease as customers reduce
    their consumption or use substitute products, which may have an
    adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition,
    producers in natural gas cost-advantaged regions, such as the
    Middle East, benefit from the lower prices of natural gas and
    NGLs. Competition from producers in these regions may cause us
    to reduce exports from North America and Europe. Any such
    reductions may increase competition for product sales within
    North America and Europe, which can result in lower margins in
    those regions. Additionally, there are a limited number of
    suppliers for some of our raw materials and utilities and, in
    some cases, the supplies are specific to the particular
    geographic region in which a facility is located.

It is also common in the chemical and refining industries for a
    facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities,
    such as steam, electricity and gas. Having a sole or limited
    number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power,
    particularly in the case of rising raw material costs. Any new
    supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable
    as those contained in our current supply agreements.

If our raw material or utility supplies were disrupted, our
    businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative
    supplies or incur excessive downtime, which would have a direct
    negative impact on plant operations. For example, hurricanes
    have in the past negatively affected crude oil and natural gas
    supplies, as well as supplies of other raw materials, utilities
    (such as electricity and steam), and industrial gases,
    contributing to increases in operating costs and, in some cases,
    disrupting production. In addition, hurricane-related disruption
    of vessel, barge, rail, truck and pipeline traffic in the
    U.S. Gulf Coast area would negatively affect shipments of
    raw materials and product.

In addition, with increased volatility in raw material costs,
    our suppliers could impose more onerous terms on us, resulting
    in shorter payment cycles and increasing our working capital
    requirements.

We
    sell products in highly competitive global markets and face
    significant price pressures.

We sell our products in highly competitive global markets. Due
    to the commodity nature of many of our products, competition in
    these markets is based primarily on price and, to a lesser
    extent, on product performance, product quality, product
    deliverability, reliability of supply and customer service.
    Generally, we are not able to protect our market position for
    these products by product differentiation and may not be able to
    pass on cost increases to our customers.

In addition, we face increased competition from companies that
    may have greater financial resources and different cost
    structures or strategic goals than us. These include large
    integrated oil companies (many of which also have chemical
    businesses), government-owned businesses, and companies that
    receive subsidies or other government incentives to produce
    certain products in a specified geographic region. Increased
    competition from these companies, especially in our olefin and
    refining businesses, could limit our ability to increase product
    sales prices in response to raw material and other cost
    increases, or could cause us to reduce product sales prices to
    compete effectively, which could reduce our profitability.
    Competitors that have greater financial resources than us may be
    able to invest significant capital into their businesses,
    including expenditures for research and development.



In addition, specialty products we produce may become
    commoditized over time. Increased competition could result in
    lower prices or lower sales volumes, which would have a negative
    impact on our results of operations.

Our
    ability to source raw materials, including crude oil, may be
    adversely affected by political instability, civil disturbances
    or other governmental actions.

We obtain a substantial portion of our principal raw materials
    from sources in North Africa, the Middle East, and South America
    that may be less politically stable than other areas in which we
    conduct business, such as Europe or the US.

Recently, increased incidents of civil unrest, including
    demonstrations which have been marked by violence, have occurred
    in some countries in North Africa and the Middle East. Some
    political regimes in these countries are threatened or have
    changed as a result of such unrest. Political instability and
    civil unrest could continue to spread in the region and involve
    other areas. Such unrest, if it continues to spread or grow in
    intensity, could lead to civil wars, regional conflict, or
    regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to
    countries in which we conduct substantial business, such as
    Europe, the US, or their respective allies.

We source a large portion of our crude oil from Venezuela. From
    time to time in the past, the Venezuelan national oil company,
    PDVSA, has declared itself in a force majeure situation and
    reduced deliveries of crude oil purportedly based on announced
    OPEC production cuts. It is impossible to predict how possible
    changes in governmental policies may affect our sourcing. Any
    significant reduction in Venezuelan crude oil supplies could
    negatively impact our ability to procure crude oil, from
    Venezuela or other sources, on economically advantageous terms.
    Political instability, civil disturbances and actions by
    governments in North Africa, the Middle East or South America
    are likely to substantially increase the price and decrease the
    supply of feedstocks necessary for our operations, which will
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Interruptions
    of operations at our facilities may result in liabilities or
    lower operating results.

We own and operate large-scale facilities. Our operating results
    are dependent on the continued operation of our various
    production facilities and the ability to complete construction
    and maintenance projects on schedule. Interruptions at our
    facilities may materially reduce the productivity and
    profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our
    business as a whole, during and after the period of such
    operational difficulties. In the past, we had to shut down
    plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, including the temporary
    shutdown of the Houston Refinery, as a result of hurricanes
    striking the Texas coast.

In addition, because the Houston Refinery is our only North
    American refining operation, an outage at the refinery could
    have a particularly negative impact on our operating results.
    Unlike our chemical and polymer production facilities, which may
    have sufficient excess capacity to mitigate the negative impact
    of lost production at other facilities, we do not have the
    ability to increase refining production elsewhere in the U.S.

Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our
    operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations
    are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and
    refining and the related storage and transportation of raw
    materials, products and wastes. These potential hazards include:

•

pipeline leaks and ruptures;

•

explosions;

•

fires;

•

severe weather and natural disasters;

•

mechanical failure;

•

unscheduled downtimes;

•

supplier disruptions;



•

labor shortages or other labor difficulties;

•

transportation interruptions;

•

remediation complications;

•

chemical and oil spills;

•

discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases;

•

storage tank leaks;

•

other environmental risks; and

•

terrorist acts.

Some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction
    of property and equipment and may result in suspension of
    operations or the shutdown of affected facilities.

Our
    operations are subject to risks inherent in chemical and
    refining businesses, and we could be subject to liabilities for
    which we are not fully insured or that are not otherwise
    mitigated.

We maintain property, business interruption, product, general
    liability, casualty and other types of insurance, including
    pollution and legal liability, that we believe are in accordance
    with customary industry practices. However, we are not fully
    insured against all potential hazards incident to our business,
    including losses resulting from natural disasters, war risks or
    terrorist acts. Changes in insurance market conditions have
    caused, and may in the future cause, premiums and deductibles
    for certain insurance policies to increase substantially and, in
    some instances, for certain insurance to become unavailable or
    available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to
    incur a significant liability for which we were not fully
    insured, we might not be able to finance the amount of the
    uninsured liability on terms acceptable to us or at all, and
    might be obligated to divert a significant portion of our cash
    flow from normal business operations.

Further, because a part of our business involves licensing
    polyolefin process technology, our licensees are exposed to
    similar risks involved in the manufacture and marketing of
    polyolefins. Hazardous incidents involving our licensees, if
    they do result or are perceived to result from use of our
    technologies, may harm our reputation, threaten our
    relationships with other licensees

and/or

lead
    to customer attrition and financial losses. Our policy of
    covering these risks through contractual limitations of
    liability and indemnities and through insurance may not always
    be effective. As a result, our financial condition and results
    of operation would be adversely affected, and other companies
    with competing technologies may have the opportunity to secure a
    competitive advantage.

Certain
    activities related to a former project raise compliance issues
    under U.S. law.

We have identified an agreement related to a former project in
    Kazakhstan under which a payment was made in late 2008 that
    raises compliance concerns under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (the “FCPA”). We have engaged outside
    counsel to investigate these activities, under the oversight of
    a special committee established by the Supervisory Board, and to
    evaluate internal controls and compliance policies and
    procedures. We made a voluntary disclosure of these matters to
    the U.S. Department of Justice in late 2009 and are
    cooperating fully with that agency. In this respect, we may not
    have conducted our business in compliance with the FCPA and may
    not have had policies and procedures in place adequate to ensure
    compliance. We cannot reasonably estimate any potential penalty
    that may arise from these matters. We have adopted and are
    implementing more stringent policies and procedures designed to
    ensure compliance. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
    these matters at this time since our investigations are ongoing.
    Violations of these laws could result in criminal and civil
    liabilities and other forms of relief that could be material to
    us.



Our

non-U.S.

operations conduct business in countries subject to U.S.
    economic sanctions and certain activities raise compliance
    issues under U.S. law.

Certain of our

non-U.S. subsidiaries

conduct business in countries subject to U.S. economic
    sanctions, including Iran. U.S. and EU laws and regulations
    prohibit certain persons from engaging in business activities,
    in whole or in part, with sanctioned countries, organizations
    and individuals.

We have and continue to adopt more significant compliance
    policies and procedures to ensure compliance with all applicable
    sanctions laws and regulations. In connection with our
    continuing review of compliance risks in this area, we made a
    voluntary disclosure of certain matters to the
    U.S. Treasury Department and intend to continue cooperating
    fully with that agency. We cannot at this point in time predict
    the outcome of this matter because our investigation is ongoing,
    but there is a risk that we could be subject to civil and
    criminal penalties.

We have made the decision to terminate all business by the
    Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries with the
    government, entities and individuals in Iran, Syria and Sudan.
    We have notified our counterparties in these countries of our
    decision and may be subject to legal actions to enforce
    agreements with the counterparties. These activities present a
    potential risk that could subject the Company to private legal
    proceedings that could be material to us. At this time, we
    cannot predict the outcome because our withdrawal activities are
    ongoing.

Our
    operations could be adversely affected by labor
    relations.

The vast majority of our employees located in Europe and South
    America are represented by labor unions and work councils.
    Approximately 900 of our employees located in North America are
    represented by labor unions. Of the North American employees,
    approximately 50% include our employees that are covered by a
    collective bargaining agreement between Houston Refining LP and
    the United Steelworkers Union, which expires on January 31,
    2012.

Our operations have been in the past, and may be in the future,
    significantly and adversely affected by strikes, work stoppages
    and other labor disputes.

We
    cannot predict with certainty the extent of future costs under
    environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations,
    and cannot guarantee they will not be material.

We may face liability arising out of the normal course of
    business, including alleged personal injury or property damage
    due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at
    our current or former facilities or chemicals that we
    manufacture, handle or own. In addition, because our products
    are components of a variety of other end-use products, we, along
    with other members of the chemical industry, are subject to
    potential claims related to those end-use products. Any
    substantial increase in the success of these types of claims
    could negatively affect our operating results.

We (together with the industries in which we operate) are
    subject to extensive national, regional, state and local
    environmental laws, regulations, directives, rules and
    ordinances concerning

•

emissions to the air,

•

discharges onto land or surface waters or into
    groundwater; and

•

the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment,
    disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste
    materials.

Many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines
    and potential criminal sanctions for violations. Some of these
    laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting
    interpretations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations
    require us to meet specific financial responsibility
    requirements. Any substantial liability for environmental damage
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
    results of operations and cash flows.



Although we have compliance programs and other processes
    intended to ensure compliance with all such regulations, we are
    subject to the risk that our compliance with such regulations
    could be challenged. Non-compliance with certain of these
    regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs,
    penalties or assessments that could be material.

Our
    industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and
    existing or future regulations may restrict our operations,
    increase our costs of operations or require us to make
    additional capital expenditures.

Compliance with regulatory requirements could result in higher
    operating costs, such as regulatory requirements relating to
    emissions, the security of our facilities, and the
    transportation, export or registration of our products. We
    generally expect that regulatory controls worldwide will become
    increasingly more demanding, but cannot accurately predict
    future developments. Increasingly strict environmental laws and
    inspection and enforcement policies, could affect the handling,
    manufacture, use, emission or disposal of products, other
    materials or hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Stricter
    environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and
    enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs.
    Additionally, we are required to have permits for our businesses
    and are subject to licensing regulations. These permits and
    licenses are subject to renewal, modification and in some
    circumstances, revocation. Further, the permits and licenses are
    often difficult, time consuming and costly to obtain and could
    contain conditions that limit our operations.

We may
    incur substantial costs to comply with climate change
    legislation and regulatory initiatives.

There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state,
    national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas
    (“GHG”) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws
    apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may
    have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to
    evolve and, while they are likely to be increasingly widespread
    and stringent, at this stage it is not possible to accurately
    estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future
    compliance costs relating to implementation. Within the
    framework of EU emissions trading, we were allocated certain
    allowances of carbon dioxide per year for the affected plants of
    our European sites for the 2005 to 2007 period. For the second
    trading period (2008 to 2012), a number of our plants are
    included in the Europe-wide trading system. We expect to incur
    additional costs as a result of the existing emissions trading
    scheme and could incur additional costs in relation to any
    future carbon or other greenhouse gas emission trading schemes.
    The costs could be higher to the extent that we decide to sell
    credits that we need in the future.

In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (the
    “EPA”) has promulgated federal GHG regulations under
    the Clean Air Act affecting certain sources. The EPA has issued
    mandatory GHG reporting requirements which could lead to further
    obligations. The recent EPA action could be a precursor to
    further federal regulation of carbon dioxide emissions and other
    greenhouse gases, and may affect the outcome of other climate
    change lawsuits pending in United States federal courts in a
    manner unfavorable to our industry. In any event, additional
    regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the United States
    federal level or the state level with respect to GHG emissions,
    and such regulation could result in the creation of additional
    costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of
    emission allowances.

Compliance with these or other changes in laws, regulations and
    obligations that create a GHG emissions trading scheme or GHG
    reduction policies generally could significantly increase our
    costs or reduce demand for products we produce. Depending on the
    nature of potential regulations and legislation, any future laws
    and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or
    additional operating restrictions, and could have a material
    adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Legislation
    and regulatory initiatives could lead to a decrease in demand
    for our products.

New or revised governmental regulations and independent studies
    relating to the effect of our products on health, safety and the
    environment may affect demand for our products and the cost of
    producing our products. Initiatives by governments and private
    interest groups will potentially require increased toxicological
    testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals,
    including chemicals used or produced by us. For example, in the
    United States, the National Toxicology Program (“NTP”)
    is a federal interagency program that seeks to



identify and select for study chemicals and other substances to
    evaluate potential human health hazards. In the European
    Commission, REACh is regulation designed to identify the
    intrinsic properties of chemical substances, assess hazards and
    risks of the substances, and identify and implement the risk
    management measures to protect humans and the environment.

Assessments by the NTP, REACh or similar programs or regulations
    in other jurisdictions may result in heightened concerns about
    the chemicals we use or produce and may result in additional
    requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling
    or use of those chemicals. Such concerns and additional
    requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our
    customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the
    use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand
    for these products. Such a decrease in demand could have an
    adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

We
    operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate
    fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks
    relating to international operations.

We operate internationally and are subject to the risks of doing
    business on a global level, including fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates, transportation delays and interruptions, war,
    terrorist activities, epidemics, pandemics, political and
    economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the
    transfer of funds, the imposition of duties and tariffs, import
    and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor
    unrest and current and changing regulatory environments. Recent
    demonstrations and popular unrest in portions of the Middle East
    are examples of these events.

These events could reduce the demand for our products, decrease
    the prices at which we can sell our products, disrupt production
    or other operations, require substantial capital and other costs
    to comply,

and/or

increase security costs or insurance premiums, all of which
    could reduce our operating results. In addition, we obtain a
    substantial portion of our principal raw materials from
    international sources that are subject to these same risks. Our
    compliance with applicable customs, currency exchange control
    regulations, transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or
    regulations to which we may be subject could be challenged.
    Furthermore, these laws may be modified, the result of which may
    be to prevent or limit subsidiaries from transferring cash to us.

Furthermore, we are subject to certain existing, and may be
    subject to possible future, laws that limit or may limit our
    activities while some of our competitors may not be subject to
    such laws, which may adversely affect our competitiveness.

In addition, we generate revenues from export sales and
    operations that may be denominated in currencies other than the
    relevant functional currency. Exchange rates between these
    currencies and functional currencies in recent years have
    fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. Future
    events, which may significantly increase or decrease the risk of
    future movement in currencies in which we conduct our business,
    cannot be predicted. We also may hedge certain revenues and
    costs using derivative instruments to minimize the impact of
    changes in the exchange rates of those currencies compared to
    the respective functional currencies. It is possible that
    fluctuations in exchange rates will result in reduced operating
    results.

Significant
    changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions
    relating to pension costs may adversely affect the valuation of
    pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our
    pension cost.

Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate
    used to measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets
    available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and
    the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
    Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the
    portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding
    increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets,
    particularly equity securities, or in a change of the expected
    rate of return on plan assets. Any change in key actuarial
    assumptions, such as the discount rate, would impact the
    valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded
    status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension
    cost in the following fiscal years.



Certain of our current pension plans are underfunded. As of
    December 31, 2010, our pension plans were underfunded by
    $1,173 million. Any declines in the fair values of the
    pension plans assets could require additional payments by us in
    order to maintain specified funding levels.

Our pension plans are subject to legislative and regulatory
    requirements of applicable jurisdictions, which could include,
    under certain circumstances, local governmental authority to
    terminate the plan.

We may
    be required to record material charges against our earnings due
    to any number of events that could cause impairments to our
    assets.

We may be required to reduce production at or idle facilities
    for extended periods of time or exit certain businesses as a
    result of the cyclical nature of our industry. Specifically,
    oversupplies of or lack of demand for particular products or
    high raw material prices may cause us to reduce production. We
    may choose to reduce production at certain facilities because we
    have off-take arrangements at other facilities, which makes any
    reductions or idling unavailable at those facilities. Any
    decision to permanently close facilities or exit a business
    likely would result in impairment and other charges to earnings.

Temporary outages at our facilities can last for several
    quarters and sometimes longer. These outages could cause us to
    incur significant costs, including the expenses of maintaining
    and restarting these facilities. In addition, even though we may
    reduce production at facilities, we may be required to continue
    to purchase or pay for utilities or raw materials under

take-or-pay

supply agreements.

Many
    of our businesses depend on our intellectual property. Our
    future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our
    intellectual property rights, and our inability to do so could
    reduce our ability to maintain our competitiveness and
    margins.

We have a significant worldwide patent portfolio of issued and
    pending patents. These patents, together with proprietary
    technical know-how, are significant to our competitive position,
    particularly with regard to PO, performance chemicals,
    petrochemicals, and polymers, including process technologies
    such as

Spheripol, Spherizone, Hostalen, Spherilene, Lupotech
    T

and

Lupotech G

and

Avant

catalyst family
    technology rights. We rely on the patent, copyright and trade
    secret laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our
    investment in research and development, manufacturing and
    marketing. However, we may be unable to prevent third parties
    from using our intellectual property without authorization.
    Proceedings to protect these rights could be costly, and we may
    not prevail.

The protection afforded by patents varies from country to
    country and depends upon the type of patent and its scope of
    coverage. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to
    patents issued to us, our patents may be challenged,
    invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. As patents
    expire, the products and processes described and claimed under
    those patents become generally available for use by competitors.

Our continued growth strategy may bring us to regions of the
    world where intellectual property protection may be limited and
    difficult to enforce. In addition, patent rights may not prevent
    our competitors from developing, using or selling products that
    are similar or functionally equivalent to our products.
    Moreover, our competitors or other third parties may obtain
    patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully
    produce or sell our products in a competitive manner, which
    could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit
    margins or loss of market share.

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing
    technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and
    maintain our competitive position. While it is our policy to
    enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and
    third parties to protect our intellectual property, these
    confidentiality agreements may be breached, may not provide
    meaningful protection or adequate remedies may not be available.
    Additionally, others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets
    through independent development or other access by legal or
    illegal means.

The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to
    protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or
    proprietary know-how could result in significantly lower
    revenues, reduced profit margins and cash flows



and/or

loss
    of market share. We also may be subject to claims that our
    technology, patents or other intellectual property infringes on
    a third party’s intellectual property rights. Unfavorable
    resolution of these claims could result in restrictions on our
    ability to deliver the related service or in a settlement that
    could be material to us.

We may
    not be able to fully or successfully implement our ongoing plans
    to improve and globally integrate our business processes and
    functions.

We continue to seek ways to drive greater productivity,
    flexibility and cost savings. In particular, we are working
    towards the improvement and global integration of our business
    processes and functions. As part of these efforts, we have been
    centralizing certain functions within the Company, implementing
    new information technology, and integrating our existing
    information technology systems.

Our ongoing implementation of organizational improvements is
    made more difficult by our need to coordinate geographically
    dispersed operations. Inabilities and delays in implementing
    improvements can negatively affect our ability to realize
    projected or expected cost savings. In addition, the process of
    organizational improvements may cause interruptions of, or loss
    of momentum in, the activities of the Company’s businesses.
    It may also result in the loss of personnel or other labor
    issues. These issues, as well as any information technology
    systems failures, also could impede our ability to timely
    collect and report financial results in accordance with
    applicable laws and regulations.

Shared
    control or lack of control of joint ventures may delay decisions
    or actions regarding the joint ventures.

A portion of our operations are conducted through joint
    ventures, where control may be exercised by or shared with
    unaffiliated third parties. We cannot control the actions of our
    joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default or
    bankruptcy of joint venture partners. The joint ventures that we
    do not control may also lack adequate internal controls systems.

In the event that any of our joint venture partners do not
    observe their obligations, it is possible that the affected
    joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with
    our business plans. As a result, we could be required to
    increase our level of commitment in order to give effect to such
    plans. Differences in views among the joint venture participants
    also may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on
    major matters, potentially adversely affecting the business and
    operations of the joint ventures and in turn our business and
    operations.

Litigation
    or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse
    consequences, including judgments or settlements.

We are involved in civil litigation in the ordinary course of
    our business and from

time-to-time

are involved in governmental proceedings relating to the conduct
    of our business. The timing of the final resolutions to these
    types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible
    outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse
    judgments or settlements, either of which could require
    substantial payments, adversely affecting our liquidity and
    earnings.

Our
    capital requirements could limit or cause us to change our
    growth and development plans.

At December 31, 2010, we have approximately
    $6.1 billion of total consolidated debt. Our debt and the
    limitations imposed on us by our financing arrangements could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion, or all, of our
    cash flow from operations to payments of principal and interest
    on our debt;

•

make us more vulnerable during downturns , which could limit our
    ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities
    and react to changes in our business and in market or industry
    conditions; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors
    that have less debt.



If our cash flow from operations and capital resources were
    reduced, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and
    capital expenditures or other planned uses of our cash due to
    our substantial debt service obligations. We could choose to
    sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance
    our indebtedness, but there can be no assurances that we would
    be able to do so on terms we deem acceptable, if at all.
    Additionally, our debt instruments may limit our ability to
    effect such actions.

Our debt or other financing arrangements contain a number of
    restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial
    restrictions on us. There also is a minimum fixed charge
    coverage ratio contained in our U.S. ABL Facility that is
    applicable if availability under the facility falls below
    certain levels. We currently are in compliance with all of our
    restrictive and financial covenants; however, the ability to
    meet financial requirements can be affected by events beyond our
    control and, over time, these covenants may not be satisfied.

A breach of covenants of or the failure to pay principal and
    interest when due under our debt or other financing could result
    in a default or cross-default under all or some of those
    instruments. Any such default could result in an acceleration of
    all amounts outstanding under all facilities, and could relieve
    counterparties of their obligations to fund or otherwise make
    advances. Without waivers from the parties to our financing
    arrangements, any such default would have a material adverse
    effect on our ability to continue to operate.

A
    substantial portion of our shares are owned by a few persons,
    and their interests in LyondellBasell Industries N.V. may
    conflict with other stakeholders’ interests.

Three shareholders collectively own approximately 52% of our
    outstanding ordinary shares. Under Dutch law, there are no
    quorum requirements for shareholder voting and most matters are
    approved or adopted by a majority of votes cast. As a result, as
    long as these shareholders or any other substantial shareholder
    own, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of our
    outstanding shares, they will be able to significantly influence
    all matters requiring shareholder approval, including amendments
    to our Articles of Association, the election of directors,
    significant corporate transactions, dividend payments and other
    matters. These shareholders may have interests that conflict
    with other shareholders and actions may be taken that other
    shareholders do not view as beneficial.

Additionally, each of these three shareholders is party to a
    nomination agreement that entitles the shareholder cause our
    Supervisory Board to nominate for election members to our
    Supervisory Board for so long as the shareholder owns specified
    percentages of our ordinary shares.

We are
    subject to Dutch law and the rights of our ordinary shareholders
    may be different from those rights associated with companies
    governed by other laws.

As a result of being organized under the laws of The
    Netherlands, our corporate structure as well as the rights and
    obligations of our ordinary shareholders may be different from
    the rights and obligations of shareholders in companies
    incorporated in other jurisdictions. Resolutions of the general
    meeting of shareholders may be taken with majorities different
    from the majorities required for adoption of equivalent
    resolutions in, for example, Delaware companies. Additionally,
    like other Dutch companies, our articles of association and our
    board charter contain control-enhancing rights that may have the
    effect of preventing, discouraging or delaying a change of
    control.

If we
    were classified as a controlled foreign corporation, any 10%
    U.S. shareholders may be responsible for U.S. income taxes on a
    pro-rata share of our income.

If the sum of the percentage ownership held by all of our 10%
    U.S. shareholders (as determined under the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”)) exceeds 50% of our
    ordinary shares, we would be classified as a controlled foreign
    corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the
    event such a classification were made, all 10%
    U.S. shareholders would be subject to taxation under
    Subpart F of the IRC, which could require such 10%
    U.S. shareholders to pay U.S. federal income taxes on
    a pro rata portion of our income, even in the absence of any
    distribution of such income.



Based on information currently available to us, we do not
    believe we are a controlled foreign corporation at this time.

U.S.
    anti-inversion rules may apply to LyondellBasell Industries N.V.
    resulting in certain adverse U.S. federal income tax
    consequences.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    could seek to apply Section 7874 of the IRC to treat
    LyondellBasell Industries N.V. as a U.S. corporation for
    U.S. federal income tax purposes or, alternatively, it
    could seek to impose U.S. federal income tax on certain income
    of our U.S. subsidiaries. Such an application would be based
    upon the value of stock issued in our emergence from
    Chapter 11 that the former creditors and shareholders of
    our top U.S. holding company and its direct and indirect
    subsidiaries received by reason of holding claims against those
    entities.

Treatment as a U.S. corporation could result in significantly
    increased U.S. federal income tax liability to us. Application
    of the alternative could impose U.S. federal income tax on our
    U.S. subsidiaries.

Although no assurance can be given that the IRS would not take a
    contrary position regarding Section 7874’s application
    or that such position, if asserted, would not be sustained, we
    believe that the stock issued in connection with our emergence
    from the Bankruptcy Cases that is attributable to the value of
    the claims against our companies outside the U.S. Group makes a
    Section 7874 inapplicable to us. In addition, we believe
    that strong arguments can be made that Section 7874 should not
    in any event apply to us because of the substantial business
    activities that we and our affiliates conduct and have
    historically conducted in The Netherlands.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Bankruptcy
    Proceedings

On January 6, 2009, certain of LyondellBasell AF
    S.C.A.’s indirect U.S. subsidiaries, including
    Lyondell Chemical Company, and its German indirect subsidiary,
    Germany Holdings, voluntarily filed for protection under
    Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. In April and May of
    2009, LyondellBasell AF and certain other subsidiaries filed
    voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the
    Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Cases were filed in response to
    a sudden loss of liquidity in the last quarter of 2008. The
    debtors operated their businesses and managed their properties
    as debtors in possession during the Bankruptcy Cases. In
    general, this means that the Debtors operated in the ordinary
    course without Bankruptcy Court intervention. Bankruptcy Court
    approval was required, however, where the debtors sought
    authorization to engage in certain transactions not in the
    ordinary course of business.

We emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2010. As of that
    date, all assets of the debtor entities vested in the
    reorganized debtor entities free and clear of all claims, liens,
    encumbrances, charges, and other interests, except as provided
    in the Plan of Reorganization or the confirmation order entered
    on April 23, 2010 (the “Confirmation Order”).
    Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan of
    Reorganization or in the Confirmation Order, on April 30,
    2010, each holder of a claim or equity interest is deemed to
    have forever waived, released, and discharged the debtor
    entities and the reorganized debtor entities, to the fullest
    extent permitted by law, of and from any and all claims, equity
    interests, rights, and liabilities that arose prior to the
    confirmation date.

BASF
    Lawsuit

On April 12, 2005, BASF filed a lawsuit against Lyondell
    Chemical in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris County,
    asserting various claims relating to alleged breaches of a
    propylene oxide toll manufacturing contract and seeking damages
    in excess of $100 million. Lyondell Chemical denied
    breaching the contract and argued that at most it owed BASF
    nothing more than a refund of $22.5 million, which it has
    paid. On



August 13, 2007, a jury returned a verdict in favor of BASF
    in the amount of approximately $170 million (inclusive of
    the $22.5 million refund). On October 3, 2007, the
    judge in the state court case determined that prejudgment
    interest on the verdict amounted to $36 million and issued
    a final judgment. Lyondell Chemical appealed the judgment and
    has posted an appeal bond, which is collateralized by a
    $200 million letter of credit.

On April 21, 2010, oral arguments in the appeal were held
    before the Appellate Division and, on December 28, 2010,
    the judgment was reversed and the case remanded. The parties
    have filed motions with the Bankruptcy Court for a determination
    as to whether the case will proceed in the Bankruptcy Court or
    New Jersey state court. We do not expect the ultimate resolution
    of this matter to have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
    operations, although it is possible that any such resolution
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation
    for any period in which a resolution occurs.

Access
    Indemnity Demand

On December 20, 2010, one of our subsidiaries received
    demand letters from affiliates of Access Industries
    (collectively, “Access”), a more than five percent
    shareholder of the Company. We conducted an initial
    investigation of the facts underlying the demand letters and
    engaged in discussions with Access. We requested that Access
    withdraw its demands with prejudice and, on January 17,
    2011, Access declined to withdraw the demands, with or without
    prejudice.

Specifically, Access affiliates Nell Limited (“Nell”)
    and BI S.á.r.l. (“BI”) have demanded that
    LyondellBasell Industries Holdings B.V., a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of the Company (“LBIH”), indemnify them and
    their shareholders, members, affiliates, officers, directors,
    employees and other related parties for all losses, including
    attorney’s fees and expenses, arising out of a pending
    lawsuit styled

Edward S. Weisfelner, as Litigation Trustee of
    the LB Litigation Trust v. Leonard Blavatnik, et al.

,
    Adversary Proceeding

No. 09-1375

(REG), in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
    of New York.

In the

Weisfelner

lawsuit, the plaintiffs seek to recover
    damages from numerous parties, including Nell, Access and its
    affiliates. The damages sought from Nell, Access and its
    affiliates include, among other things, the return of all
    amounts earned by them related to their acquisition of shares of
    Lyondell Chemical Company prior to its acquisition by Basell AF
    S.C.A. in December 2007, distributions by Basell AF S.C.A. to
    its shareholders before it acquired Lyondell Chemical Company,
    and management and transaction fees and expenses. We cannot at
    this time determine the amount of liability, if any, that may be
    sought from LBIH by way of indemnity if a judgment is rendered
    or a settlement is paid in the

Weisfelner

lawsuit.

Nell and BI have also demanded that LBIH pay $50 million in
    management fees for the years 2009 and 2010 and that LBIH pay
    other unspecified amounts relating to advice purportedly given
    in connection with financing and other strategic transactions.

Nell and BI assert that LBIH’s responsibility for indemnity
    and the claimed fees and expenses arises out of a management
    agreement entered into on December 11, 2007, between Nell
    and Basell AF S.C.A. They assert that LBIH, as a former
    subsidiary of Basell AF S.C.A., is jointly and severally liable
    for Basell AF S.C.A.’s obligations under the agreement,
    notwithstanding that LBIH was not a signatory to the agreement
    and the liabilities of Basell AF S.C.A., which was a signatory,
    were discharged in the LyondellBasell bankruptcy proceedings.

We do not believe that the management agreement is in effect or
    that the Company, LBIH, or any other Company-affiliated entity
    owes any obligations under the management agreement. We intend
    to defend vigorously any proceedings, claims or demands that may
    be asserted.

Environmental
    Matters

From time to time we and our joint ventures receive notices or
    inquiries from federal, state or local governmental entities
    regarding alleged violations of environmental laws and
    regulations pertaining to, among other things, the disposal,
    emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances,
    including hazardous



wastes. Item 103 of the SEC’s

Regulation S-K

requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a
    governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the
    proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we
    reasonably believe could exceed $100,000. The following matters
    pending as of December 31, 2010 are disclosed in accordance
    with that requirement:

As part of the government settlement in the chapter 11
    proceedings, the U.S., on behalf of EPA, was allowed a general
    unsecured claim of $499,000 against Millennium Specialty
    Chemicals Inc. and $480,000 against Houston Refining LP. These
    allowed claims settled the penalty amounts for alleged
    noncompliance based upon pre-petition activities. In the case of
    the Houston refinery, the allegations arise from a 2007 EPA
    Clean Air Act inspection. In the case of Millennium Specialty
    Chemicals, EPA conducted an inspection in 2008 at the Colonels
    Island, Georgia facility and questions were raised concerning
    handling of contaminated wastewater. Final resolution regarding
    these issues and any post-petition penalties is still subject to
    further negotiations with the government.

MARKET
    FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
    AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our capital was issued effective April 30, 2010 in
    connection with our emergence from bankruptcy proceedings. Our
    shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange, under the
    symbol “LYB,” since October 14, 2010. From
    April 30, 2010 until October 13, 2010, our shares they
    were quoted in the Pink OTC Markets, Inc. (the “Pink
    Sheets”) under the symbols “LALLF” and
    “LBLLF.” The following table sets forth the range of
    the high and low per share sales prices for our shares as
    reported on the NYSE since October 14, 2010 and on the Pink
    Sheets from April 30, 2010 through October 13, 2010.

On March 15, 2011, the closing price of our stock on the
    NYSE was $38.28. As of March 15, 2011, we had approximately
    3,700 shareholders, based on the number of record holders
    on that date.

On April 30, 2010, when our capital was issued, we had both
    class A and class B shares. The two classes were
    identical in all respects, other than a liquidation preference
    on the class B shares of an amount equal to $10.61 per
    share after payments to our creditors and certain supermajority
    voting rights with respect to transactions that would cause the
    class B shares to be purchased, converted or exchanged at a
    value less than $10.61 per share. The class B shares were
    convertible upon request of holders into class A shares on
    a

one-for-one

basis. Additionally, our Articles of Association provided that
    on the first day on which the closing price per share exceeded
    $21.22 for 45 consecutive trading days in a 60 day period
    (provided that the threshold was met on each of the first and
    last day of the 60 day period), the class B shares
    would automatically, and without further action of the holders
    thereof, convert to class A shares. At the close of
    business on December 6, 2010, all class B shares
    converted to class A shares pursuant to the automatic
    conversion provision.

We have not yet paid any dividends on our shares. The payment of
    dividends in the future will be subject to the requirements of
    Dutch law and the discretion of our shareholders (in the case of
    annual dividends), our Management Board and Supervisory Board.
    The declaration of any future cash dividends and, if declared,
    the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon general
    business conditions, our financial condition, our earnings and
    cash flow, our capital requirements, financial covenants and
    other contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends or
    distributions.



We are a holding company and all of our operations are conducted
    through our subsidiaries. Consequently, we will rely on
    dividends or advances from our subsidiaries to fund any
    dividends. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay
    dividends is subject to applicable local law. These laws could
    limit the payment of dividends and distributions to us, which
    would restrict our ability to pay dividends in the future.
    Additionally, our financing arrangements include restrictive
    covenants that currently limit payments to shareholder in the
    form of dividends and share repurchases on an annual basis to
    $50 million plus 1.75% of net tangible assets. Beginning in
    the second quarter of 2012, this amount is increased by a
    percentage of net income earned by the Company.

We have not repurchased any of our shares.

    LyondellBasell Industries shares, the S&P 500 Chemicals

Recent
    Sales of Unregistered Securities

As of April 30, 2010, the date of the emergence from
    bankruptcy proceedings, we:

•

issued 300,000,000 shares to eligible holders of certain
    claims against our predecessor, LyondellBasell AF, and its
    subsidiaries;

•

issued 263,901,979 shares in connection with a rights
    offering that gave certain claim holders the right to subscribe
    for shares at a price of $10.61 per share; and

•

issued warrants to purchase 11,508,204 shares with an
    exercise price of $15.90 per share.

On April 23, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final
    order that the offering, issuance, and distribution of any
    securities contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization, including
    the issuances described above and the issuance of shares upon
    exercise of the warrants, shall be exempt from the registration
    requirements of



Section 5 of the Securities Act and any other applicable
    law requiring registration or qualification prior to the
    offering, issuance, distribution, or sale of securities. An
    aggregate of 2,326,676 shares have been issued upon
    exercise of warrants.

Additionally, up to 22,000,000 shares are authorized for
    issuance to employees and directors of LyondellBasell Industries
    N.V. and its subsidiaries pursuant to our incentive plan.
    Pursuant to LyondellBasell Industries N.V.’s 2010 Long-Term
    Incentive Plan, and effective as of April 30, 2010, we
    issued Mr. Gallogly 1,771,794 shares of restricted
    stock. The restricted shares vest on the fifth anniversary of
    the date of Mr. Gallogly’s employment agreement of
    May 14, 2009. We have issued an additional 2,036,582
    restricted stock units to certain senior level employees and
    members of the Supervisory Board. The employee restricted stock
    units vest, subject to earlier forfeiture, on the fifth
    anniversary of the date of grant. Each of the directors’
    restricted stock unit awards vest on June 30 in the year of the
    expiration of his term as a director, which is 2011, 2012 or
    2013. All of these issuances were compensatory in nature and
    made without cost to the employees or directors.

Effective April 30, 2010, we issued Mr. Gallogly
    options to purchase 5,639,020 shares at an exercise price
    of $17.61 per share. The options vest in equal annual increments
    over the five year period beginning May 14, 2009. We have
    issued additional options to purchase up to
    3,087,573 shares to certain senior level employees at
    exercise prices ranging from $16.45 to $26.75 per share. In each
    case, the exercise price is equal to the fair market value of
    our shares on the date of grant. These stock options vest in
    three equal annual increments, beginning on the second
    anniversary of the date of grant. The grants of the stock
    options were compensatory in nature and made without cost to the
    employees.

The grants of the restricted stock units and the stock options
    were made from time to time between April 30 and
    December 31, 2010.

These grants were made in reliance on Section 4(2) and
    Rule 701 of the Securities Act related to securities issued
    not involving a public offering and pursuant to certain
    compensatory benefit plans and contracts or are deemed to not be
    sales of securities under Section 2 of the Securities Act.

SELECTED
    FINANCIAL DATA

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of factors
    that will enhance an understanding of this data.

The following selected financial data of the Company and its
    predecessor, LyondellBasell AF S.C.A. (“LyondellBasell
    AF”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
    Financial Statements and related notes thereto and
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” below. The
    selected financial data of the Company and the Predecessor were
    derived from their audited consolidated financial statements.
    Those financial statements were prepared from the books and
    records of LyondellBasell AF for periods through April 30,
    2010 and of the Company upon emergence from bankruptcy after
    that date. As discussed elsewhere in this annual report on

Form 10-K,

we became the successor parent holding company of the
    subsidiaries of LyondellBasell AF and the reporting entity upon
    completion of the bankruptcy proceedings. Financial information
    is reported for the Company as the successor on a basis
    different from financial information of the predecessor,
    LyondellBasell AF. As a result of the application of fresh-start
    accounting and restructuring activities pursuant to the Plan of
    Reorganization, the Successor period is not comparable to the
    Predecessor period.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

GENERAL

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the
    information contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements,
    and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. When
    we use the terms “we,” “us,” “our”
    or similar words in this discussion, unless the context
    otherwise requires, we are referring to LyondellBasell
    Industries N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We also refer
    to the Company as “LyondellBasell N.V.,” the
    “Successor Company,” and the “Successor.”



In addition to comparisons of current operating results with the
    same period in the prior year, we have included, as additional
    disclosure, certain “trailing quarter” comparisons of
    fourth quarter 2010 operating results to third quarter 2010
    operating results. Our businesses are highly cyclical, in
    addition to experiencing some less significant seasonal effects.
    Trailing quarter comparisons may offer important insight into
    current business direction.

References to industry benchmark prices or costs, including the
    weighted average cost of ethylene production, are generally to
    industry prices and costs reported by CMAI, except that
    references to industry benchmarks for refining and oxyfuels
    market margins are to industry prices reported by Platts, a
    reporting service of The McGraw-Hill Companies and crude oil and
    natural gas benchmark price references are to Bloomberg.

OVERVIEW

Our performance is driven by, among other things, global
    economic conditions generally and their impact on demand for our
    products, raw material and energy prices, and industry-specific
    issues, such as production capacity. Our businesses are subject
    to the cyclicality and volatility seen in the chemicals and
    refining industries generally.

EMERGENCE
    FROM CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS

Bankruptcy Filing —

On January 6, 2009,
    certain of LyondellBasell AF’s U.S. subsidiaries and
    one of its European holding companies, Basell Germany Holdings
    GmbH (“Germany Holdings” and collectively, the
    “Initial Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for
    relief under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
    In addition, voluntary petitions for relief under
    chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code were filed by
    LyondellBasell AF and its General Partner, LyondellBasell AF GP
    S.à.r.l. on April 24, 2009 and by thirteen additional
    U.S. subsidiaries on May 8, 2009 (collectively with
    the Initial Debtors, the “Debtors”). All 94 of these
    cases (the “Bankruptcy Cases”) were jointly
    administered under the caption “

In re Lyondell Chemical
    Company, et al

,” and the Debtors operated their
    businesses and managed their properties as

“debtors-in-possession”

under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and in
    accordance with the applicable provisions of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code and orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Court.

On April 23, 2010, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed
    LyondellBasell AF’s Third Amended and Restated Plan of
    Reorganization and the Debtors emerged from chapter 11
    protection on April 30, 2010 (the “Emergence
    Date”). As a result of the emergence from chapter 11
    proceedings, certain prepetition liabilities against the Debtors
    were discharged to the extent set forth in the Plan of
    Reorganization and otherwise applicable law and the Debtors made
    distributions to their creditors in accordance with the terms of
    the Plan of Reorganization.

Plan of Reorganization

— LyondellBasell N.V.
    became the successor parent holding company for the subsidiaries
    of LyondellBasell AF after completion of the Bankruptcy Cases.
    LyondellBasell N.V. is a company with limited liability
    (

Naamloze Vennootschap

) incorporated under Dutch law by
    deed of incorporation dated October 15, 2009.
    LyondellBasell AF, which was the predecessor parent holding
    company, is no longer part of the consolidated LyondellBasell
    group subsequent to the Emergence Date.

Under the Plan of Reorganization, the organizational structure
    of the Company in North America was simplified by the removal of
    90 legal entities. The ultimate ownership of 49 of these
    entities (identified as Schedule III Debtors in the Plan of
    Reorganization) was transferred to a new owner, the Millennium
    Custodial Trust, a trust established for the benefit of certain
    creditors, and these entities are no longer part of
    LyondellBasell N.V. In addition, certain real properties owned
    by the Debtors, including the Schedule III Debtors, were
    transferred to the Environmental Custodial Trust, which now owns
    and is responsible for these properties. Any associated
    liabilities of the entities transferred to and owned by the
    Millennium Custodial Trust are the responsibility of those
    entities and claims regarding those entities will be resolved
    solely using their assets and the assets of the trust. In total,
    $250 million of cash was used to fund the two trusts,
    including approximately $80 million for the Millennium
    Custodial Trust and approximately $170 million for the



Environmental Custodial Trust and to make certain direct
    payments to the Environmental Protection Agency and certain
    state environmental agencies.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, administrative and
    priority claims, as well as the new money

debtor-in-possession

(“DIP”) financing that had been incurred during the
    bankruptcy proceedings were repaid in full. The lenders of
    certain DIP loans representing a

dollar-for-dollar

roll-up

or
    conversion of previously outstanding senior secured loans
    (“DIP

Roll-up

Notes”) received Senior Secured 11% Notes in the same
    principal amount as the DIP

Roll-up

Notes. Holders of senior secured claims received a combination
    of LyondellBasell N.V. class A ordinary shares; rights to
    purchase class B ordinary shares of LyondellBasell N.V.;
    LyondellBasell N.V. warrants to purchase class A ordinary
    shares; and cash in exchange for their claims. Pursuant to the
    Amended Lender Litigation Settlement approved by the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court on March 11, 2010, allowed
    general unsecured claims received a combination of cash and
    class A ordinary shares of LyondellBasell N.V.

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for a
    discussion of the emergence financing.

Tax Impact of Reorganization

— Under the Plan
    of Reorganization, LyondellBasell AF’s pre-petition debt
    securities, revolving credit facility and other obligations were
    extinguished. Absent an exception, a debtor recognizes
    cancellation of indebtedness income (“CODI”) upon
    discharge of its outstanding indebtedness for an amount of
    consideration that is less than its adjusted issue price. The
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”),
    provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case may exclude CODI
    from income, but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by
    the amount of any CODI realized as a result of the consummation
    of a plan of reorganization. The amount of CODI realized by a
    taxpayer is the adjusted issue price of any indebtedness
    discharged less the sum of (i) the amount of cash paid,
    (ii) the issue price of any new indebtedness issued and
    (iii) the fair market value of any other consideration,
    including equity, issued. As a result of the market value of our
    equity on the Emergence Date, the estimated amount of CODI
    exceeded the estimated amount of its tax attributes by
    approximately $7,433 million. The actual reduction in tax
    attributes does not occur until the first day of the subsequent
    tax year, or January 1, 2011.

As a result of tax attribute reduction, we do not expect to
    retain any U.S. net operating loss carryforwards,
    alternative minimum tax credits or capital loss carryforwards.
    In addition, we expect that most, if not all, of our tax basis
    in depreciable assets will be eliminated. Accordingly, it is
    expected that our liability for U.S. income taxes in future
    periods will reflect these adjustments and our estimated cash
    tax liabilities for the years following 2010 will be
    significantly higher than in 2009 or 2010. This situation may be
    somewhat postponed by the temporary bonus depreciation
    provisions contained in the Job Creation Act of 2010, which
    allows current year expensing for certain qualified acquisitions.

The Company recorded its adjusted taxes in fresh-start
    accounting without adjustment for estimated changes of tax
    attributes that could occur from May 1, 2010 to
    January 1, 2011, the date of actual reduction of tax
    attributes. Any adjustment to our tax attributes as a result of
    events or transactions that occurred during the period from
    May 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 was reflected in the
    earnings of the Successor Company.

IRC Sections 382 and 383 provide an annual limitation with
    respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax
    attributes, as well as certain

built-in-losses,

against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change
    in ownership. The emergence from chapter 11 proceedings is
    considered a change in ownership for purposes of IRC
    Section 382. The limitation under the IRC is based on the
    value of the corporation as of the Emergence Date. We do not
    expect that the application of these limitations will have a
    material affect upon our U.S. federal income tax
    liabilities. Germany has similar provisions that preclude the
    use of certain tax attributes generated prior to a change of
    control. As of the Emergence Date, the Company had tax benefits
    associated with excess interest expense carryforwards of
    $16 million in Germany that were eliminated as a result of
    the emergence. The reversal of tax benefits associated with the
    loss of these carryforwards is reflected in the Predecessor
    period.

Our current and future provisions for income taxes are
    significantly impacted by the initial recognition of, and
    changes in, valuation allowances in certain countries and are
    dependent upon future earnings and earnings



sustainability in those jurisdictions. Consequently, our
    effective tax rate of 10.1% in the Successor period is not
    indicative of future effective tax rates.

Financial Information

— Following the
    completion of the Bankruptcy Cases, LyondellBasell AF’s
    equity interests in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and
    LyondellBasell N.V., the successor holding company, now owns and
    operates, directly and indirectly, substantially the same
    business owned and operated by LyondellBasell AF prior to
    emergence from bankruptcy. For accounting purposes, the
    operations of LyondellBasell AF are deemed to have ceased on
    April 30, 2010 and LyondellBasell N.V. is deemed to have
    begun operations on that date. Effective May 1, 2010, we
    adopted fresh-start accounting. References in the following
    discussions to the “Company” for periods prior to
    April 30, 2010, the Emergence Date, are to the Predecessor
    Company and, for periods after the Emergence Date, to the
    Successor Company.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present
    separately the period prior to April 30, 2010 and the
    period after emergence from bankruptcy to recognize the
    application of fresh-start accounting. Management believes that
    combining the Successor and Predecessor periods for the year
    ended December 31, 2010, which is a non-GAAP presentation,
    provides a more meaningful comparison of the 2010, 2009 and 2008
    results of operations and cash flows when considered with the
    effects of fresh-start accounting described below. As a result,
    we have combined the periods in our discussion to enable a more
    meaningful analysis of year over year results. The effects of
    fresh-start accounting are specifically addressed throughout the
    discussion to ensure a proper analysis. References in the
    following discussion to results for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 are to the combined Successor and
    Predecessor periods unless otherwise specifically described as
    Successor or Predecessor.

The primary impacts of our reorganization pursuant to the Plan
    of Reorganization and the adoption of fresh-start accounting on
    our results of operations are as follows:

Inventory

— We adopted the last in, first out
    (“LIFO”) method of accounting for inventory upon
    implementation of fresh-start accounting. Prior to the emergence
    from bankruptcy, LyondellBasell AF used both the first in, first
    out (“FIFO”) and LIFO methods of accounting to
    determine inventory cost. For purposes of evaluating segment
    results, management reviewed operating results for
    LyondellBasell AF determined using current cost, which
    approximates results using the LIFO method of accounting for
    inventory. Subsequent to the Emergence Date, our operating
    results are reviewed using the LIFO method of accounting for
    inventory. While determining the impact of the adoption of LIFO
    on predecessor periods is not practicable, we believe that the
    current cost method used by the Predecessor for segment
    reporting is similar to LIFO and the current cost method would
    have resulted in a decrease of cost of sales of $29 million
    for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.

In addition, on April 30, 2010, pursuant to ASC Topic 852,

Reorganizations

, we recorded inventory at fair value. The
    increase in inventory of $1,297 million was primarily in
    the U.S. and was largely driven by the price of crude oil.
    The decline of the per barrel benchmark price of crude oil from
    $86.15 at April 30, 2010 to $75.63 at June 30, 2010
    contributed to a $333 million lower of cost or market
    charge in the second quarter 2010, primarily to our raw
    materials and finished goods inventory. In the third quarter
    2010, lower market prices, primarily for polypropylene, resulted
    in an additional $32 million lower of cost or market charge
    to adjust the value of our finished goods inventory to market.
    During the fourth quarter 2010, we recorded a $323 million
    non-cash credit to reflect the market price recovery of WTI
    crude oil, substantially offsetting the second quarter 2010
    lower of cost or market adjustment to our raw materials
    inventory. The effect of these adjustments to the value of our
    inventory is reflected in cost of sales for the Successor period.

Depreciation and amortization expense

—
    Depreciation and amortization expense is lower in the Successor
    period as a result of our revaluation of assets for fresh-start
    accounting. For additional information on the



revaluation of assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization as reported
    for all periods presented is as follows:

    partially offset by interest expense on the new debt incurred as

Overview
    of Results of Operations

2010 Versus 2009

— Global market conditions in
    2010 improved from the weak conditions experienced throughout
    most of 2009 as demand in the durable goods sector, particularly
    the automotive markets, was higher than in 2009. As a result,
    demand and operating rates were higher in 2010 than in 2009. In
    addition, certain of our business segments benefited from
    planned and unplanned competitor operating disruptions,
    particularly during the second quarter 2010.

Excluding the impacts of fresh-start accounting discussed above
    in “— Emergence from Chapter 11
    Proceedings,” operating results in 2010 generally reflected
    higher product margins and higher sales volumes compared to
    2009. Reliable operations and the effect of industry supply
    disruptions resulted in higher product margins and higher sales
    volumes in the O&P-Americas business segment. Higher
    operating results in the O&P-EAI and the I&D
    businesses were primarily a reflection of higher sales volumes
    and higher product margins due to improvement in the durable
    goods markets, especially the automotive market. The Refining
    and Oxyfuels business segment results were higher in 2010
    primarily due to higher refining margins at the Houston
    refinery. Lower licensing revenue contributed to lower results
    in the Technology segment.

2009 Versus 2008

— Although global market
    conditions in 2009 improved compared to late 2008, compared to
    the full year 2008, market conditions in 2009 were significantly
    weaker. Demand was particularly weak in durable goods market
    sectors, including housing and automotive markets. Similarly,
    while industry operating rates and sales volumes improved during
    the course of 2009 compared to late 2008, for the full year
    2009, they were below the levels experienced for the full year
    2008, despite the significant decline in business activity late
    in 2008.



Refining margins were significantly lower in 2009 as a result of
    weak demand for distillates, such as diesel and heating oil.
    Heavy crude oil refining margins were also negatively affected
    by a contraction in the differential between the price of light
    and heavy crude oil. After peaking at a record-setting level in
    mid-2008, prices for crude oil and NGLs on average were
    significantly lower in 2009. In 2009, chemical product margins
    also generally declined because of the weaker pricing
    environment and lower average sales prices. An exception was the
    U.S. polyethylene market, which experienced strong export
    demand and higher product margins during the latter half of 2009.

LyondellBasell AF’s underlying operating results in 2009,
    compared to 2008, primarily reflected the negative effects of
    significantly lower product margins and sales volumes. These
    were partly offset by the benefits of lower fixed costs, strong
    margins for LyondellBasell AF’s propylene oxide and
    advanced polyolefin products and higher U.S. polyethylene
    margins. A substantial portion of the lower product margins was
    due to refining operations, while the lower sales volumes were
    concentrated in the base chemicals and polymers products and
    reflected the weakness in demand. The lower fixed costs resulted
    from LyondellBasell AF’s aggressive cost reduction program.

Net income in 2009 also reflected charges related to
    LyondellBasell AF’s planned reorganization under
    chapter 11, including professional fees, write offs of
    plant asset values, contract rejection claims, employee
    severance costs and other costs associated with the
    chapter 11 proceedings and plant closures. For a detailed
    description of reorganization charges, see “Results of
    Operations” below.

Net income in 2008 included charges for asset impairments,
    reflecting declines in the value of inventory, goodwill and
    other intangible assets, as markets weakened and product sales
    prices and margins declined significantly at the end of 2008.

RESULTS
    OF OPERATIONS

Revenues

— We had revenues of
    $41,151 million in 2010, $30,828 million in 2009 and
    $50,706 million in 2008. The $10,323 million increase
    in 2010 compared to 2009 reflected higher demand, resulting in
    higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes across most
    business segments, partially offset by lower licensing revenue
    in the Technology business segment. Higher crude-oil and natural
    gas prices also contributed to the increase in average sales
    prices in 2010. The $19,878 million decrease in 2009
    compared to 2008 reflected the effect of significantly lower
    sales prices and sales volumes due to lower crude oil and
    natural gas prices and weaker demand.

Cost of Sales

— Cost of sales were
    $37,102 million in 2010, $29,372 million in 2009 and
    $48,780 million in 2008.

The $7,730 million increase in cost of sales in 2010 was
    primarily due to higher raw material costs, which reflect the
    effects of higher crude oil and natural gas liquids-based raw
    material prices, as well as the effect of higher sales volumes.
    Cost of sales in the Successor period included a
    $64 million charge related to a change in estimate related
    to a dispute over environmental liability. Lower depreciation
    and amortization expense of $630 million due to the
    $7,474 million write-down of Property, plant, and equipment
    associated with the revaluation of our assets in fresh-start
    accounting partially offset the higher costs in the Successor
    Period. The Predecessor period in 2010 included a charge of
    $23 million for plant closure and other costs related to a
    polypropylene plant in Terni, Italy.

The $19,408 million decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 was
    primarily due to lower market prices for crude oil, crude
    oil-based and natural gas liquids raw materials, lower fixed and
    variable costs, and lower sales volumes and operating rates,
    reflecting the weak demand.

Inventory Valuation Adjustment

— The Company
    had non-cash inventory valuation adjustments of
    $42 million, $127 million and $1,256 million in
    the 2010 Successor period, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We
    recorded non-cash charges in the 2010 Successor period totaling
    $365 million to adjust the value of our raw materials and
    finished goods inventory to market as of June 30, 2010 and
    September 30, 2010. As discussed above, these lower of cost
    or market charges were the result of the decline in the per
    barrel benchmark price of crude oil from the Emergence Date to
    June 30, 2010 and lower market prices for certain products,
    primarily polypropylene. A non-cash credit of $323 million
    recorded in the fourth quarter 2010 to reflect the recovery of
    market price substantially offset the lower of cost or market
    adjustment related to our raw materials inventory. In 2009 and
    2008, the Company recorded charges of $127 million and
    $1,256 million, respectively, to adjust the value of its
    inventory to market, which was lower than the carrying value on
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Impairments

— Impairments of $37 million,
    $17 million and $5,207 million were recognized by the
    Company in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the 2010
    Successor period, we recognized $28 million of impairment
    charges, including a charge of $25 million related to
    impairment of the carrying value of assets at the Berre
    refinery. Capital spending required for the operation of the
    Berre refinery will continue to be impaired until such time as
    the discounted cash flow projections for the Berre refinery are
    sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying amount. In 2008,
    the Company recognized charges of $4,982 million and
    $225 million, respectively, for impairment of goodwill
    related to the December 20, 2007 acquisition of Lyondell
    Chemical and the carrying value of its Berre refinery.

SG&A Expenses

— Selling, general and
    administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were
    $872 million in 2010, $850 million in 2009 and
    $1,197 million in 2008. The $347 million decrease in
    2009 compared to 2008 was primarily the result of LyondellBasell
    AF’s 2009 cost reduction program, and a favorable effect
    from changes in currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates
    had a favorable effect on costs of

non-U.S. operations

as the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro in 2009
    compared to 2008. SG&A expenses in 2008 included
    $564 million of Lyondell Chemical and Berre refinery
    SG&A expense following their acquisitions by LyondellBasell
    AF on December 20, 2007 and April 1, 2008,
    respectively.

Operating Income (Loss)

— The Company had
    operating income of $2,944 million and $317 million in
    2010 and 2009, respectively, and an operating loss of
    $5,928 million in 2008. The results of our underlying



operations improved in 2010, compared to 2009, reflecting higher
    product margins and the effect of higher sales volumes as demand
    increased due to improved global market conditions, particularly
    in the first half of the year compared to the same periods in
    2009 when demand was very weak. Operating results in the 2010
    Successor period benefited from lower depreciation and
    amortization expense of $651 million primarily due to the
    $7,474 million write-down of Property, plant, and equipment
    associated with the revaluation of our assets in fresh-start
    accounting. Operating results in the 2010 Successor period also
    included the negative impact of the $64 million non-cash
    charge related to a dispute over environmental liability.

Results in 2009 compared to 2008 reflected the benefits of the
    Company’s cost reduction program, offset by the unfavorable
    effects of lower product margins, sales volumes, and currency
    exchange rates on

non-U.S. operating

income. Results in 2008 were impacted by charges of
    $4,982 million and $225 million, respectively, for
    impairment of goodwill related to the December 20, 2007
    acquisition of Lyondell Chemical and the carrying value of the
    Berre refinery; and a charge of $1,256 million to adjust
    inventory to market value.

Operating results for each of our business segments are reviewed
    further in the “Segment Analysis” section below.

Interest Expense

— Interest expense was
    $1,258 million in 2010, $1,795 million in 2009 and
    $2,476 million in 2008. Interest expense was
    $537 million lower in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due
    to the repayment or discharge of debt on the Emergence Date in
    accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, upon which interest
    was accruing during the bankruptcy, and the repayment of
    $1,233 million of debt in the fourth quarter 2010. This
    decrease in interest expense was partially offset by interest
    expense on the debt incurred as part of the emergence financing
    (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and
    $26 million of charges related to the prepayment of
    $769 million of debt in December 2010. The prepayment of
    debt included $275 million of our 8% senior secured
    notes and $494 million of the senior secured term loan
    facility in December 2010 and $464 million under the
    accounts receivable securitization facility and accounts
    receivable factoring agreement during October and November of
    2010. Interest expense in 2009 was lower, compared to 2008,
    primarily due to various debt instruments becoming subject to
    compromise as a result of the chapter 11 filing.
    Contractual interest expense for the Predecessor periods was
    $2,720 million for 2009 and $2,476 million for 2008.

Other Income (Expense), net

— The Company had
    other expense, net, of $366 million in 2010 and other
    income, net, of $319 million and $106 million in 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Other expense, net, in 2010 included the
    negative effect of the fair value adjustment of the warrants to
    purchase our shares of $114 million and foreign exchange
    losses of $240 million. In 2009 and 2008, the Company
    recognized involuntary conversion gains of $120 million and
    $79 million, respectively, representing partial insurance
    settlements of outstanding insurance claims related to damages
    sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in
    Münchsmünster, Germany, and foreign exchange gains of
    $123 million and $20 million, respectively, as a
    result of changes in currency exchange rates. Other income, net,
    in 2009 also included benefits totaling $72 million
    resulting from indemnification payments received from previous
    plant owners for employee benefit and environmental remediation
    costs related to plant closures and a $15 million gain
    related to settlement of a U.K. pension claim.

Income (Loss) from Equity Investments

— The
    Company had income from equity investments totaling
    $170 million in 2010, a loss from equity investments of
    $181 million in 2009 and income from equity investments of
    $38 million in 2008. The loss from equity investments in
    2009 included a $228 million charge for impairment of the
    carrying value of the Company’s investments in certain
    joint ventures. Income from equity investments in 2010 benefited
    from the operations of our Saudi Ethylene &
    Polyethylene Company Ltd. joint venture, which commenced
    operations in June 2009, and from a new polypropylene plant
    operated by our HMC Polymers Company Ltd. joint venture that
    commenced operations in October 2010.

Reorganization Items

— The Company had income
    from reorganization items totaling $7,557 million in 2010
    compared to reorganization expense of $2,961 million in
    2009. Gains from reorganization items in 2010 included gains
    totaling $13,617 million related to settlement of
    liabilities subject to compromise, deconsolidation of entities
    upon emergence, adjustments related to rejected contracts, and a
    reduction of environmental



remediation liabilities. These gains were partially offset by a
    charge of $6,086 million related to the changes in net
    assets resulting from the application of fresh-start accounting
    and by several one-time emergence costs, including the success
    and other fees earned by certain professionals upon the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy, damages related to the
    rejection of executory contracts and plant closure costs.
    Reorganization items expense in the 2010 Successor period is
    primarily related to professional fees. The 2009 period included
    charges for the write off of assets associated with a lease
    rejection; damage claims related to certain executory contracts;
    the net write off of unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums
    and discounts; environmental liabilities; professional fees
    associated with the chapter 11 proceedings; shutdown costs
    related primarily to the shutdown of its olefins plant at
    Chocolate Bayou, Texas and the long-term idling of its ethylene
    glycol facility in Beaumont, Texas; as well as employee
    severance and other costs. For additional information on
    reorganization items, see Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Income Tax

— In the eight months ended
    December 31, 2010, the Successor recorded a tax provision
    of $170 million, representing an effective tax rate of
    10.1% on pre-tax income of $1,686 million. In the four
    months ended April 30, 2010, the Predecessor recorded a tax
    benefit of $1,123 million, representing a negative
    effective tax rate of 15.2% on pre-tax income of
    $7,383 million. During 2009, the Predecessor recorded a tax
    benefit of $1,411 million, representing an effective tax
    rate of 32.9% on a pre-tax loss of $4,283 million. The
    provision for the 2010 Successor period differs from the
    statutory rate primarily due to the adjustment of various
    chapter 11 tax-related assets, the release of certain
    valuation allowances against our net operating loss
    carryforwards in the fourth quarter 2010, due to improved
    business results and the completion of a reorganization of our
    French subsidiaries. The tax provision for the 2010 Predecessor
    period differs from the statutory rate primarily because a
    significant portion of the pre-tax gain from the discharge of
    pre-petition liabilities, which was partially offset by
    restructuring charges for which no tax benefit was provided. The
    tax benefit recorded for 2009 was lower than the statutory rate
    primarily due to restructuring costs for which no tax benefit
    was provided. During 2008, LyondellBasell AF had a tax benefit
    of $848 million on a pretax loss of $8,191 million.
    The effective income tax rate of 10.4% in 2008 primarily
    reflected the effect of goodwill impairment charges, which are
    not deductible for tax purposes and the provision of valuation
    allowances in jurisdictions where future tax benefits are not
    expected to be realized.

Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations

—
    Income from continuing operations was $10,022 million in
    2010 and losses from continuing operations were
    $2,872 million in 2009 and $7,343 million in 2008. The
    following table summarizes the major components contributing to

Impairments in 2009 include an adjustment related to prior
    periods which increased income from operations and net income
    for the three-month period ended December 31, 2009, by
    $65 million. The adjustment related to an overstatement of
    goodwill impairment in 2008.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of
    Tax

— The Company had income from discontinued
    operations of $64 million in the 2010 Successor period
    related to the sale of its Flavor and Fragrance chemicals
    business. The Company had a loss from discontinued operations in
    the 2010 Predecessor period of $2 million and income from
    discontinued operations of $1 million and $15 million,
    respectively, in 2009 and 2008 related to the sale of a toluene
    di-isocyanate business in September 2008.

Fourth Quarter 2010 versus Third Quarter 2010

—
    Net income was $766 million in the fourth quarter 2010
    compared to $467 million in the third quarter 2010. The
    $299 million increase in net income was primarily
    attributable to the release of

non-U.S. valuation

allowances against net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter
    2010, a net benefit related to reorganization items attributable
    to events that occurred during the fourth quarter 2010 and the
    gain related to the sale of our Flavor and Fragrance chemicals
    business in December 2010, partially offset by lower operating
    results attributable to our O&P-EAI and Technology segments
    discussed below. The release of the

non-U.S. valuation

allowances was due to improved business results and the
    completion of a reorganization of our French subsidiaries.

Segment
    Analysis

Our operations are primarily in five reportable segments:
    O&P — Americas; O&P — EAI;
    I&D; Refining and Oxyfuels; and Technology. These
    operations comprise substantially the same businesses owned and
    operated by LyondellBasell AF prior to the Company’s
    emergence from bankruptcy. However, for accounting purposes, the
    operations of LyondellBasell AF are deemed to have ceased on
    April 30, 2010 and LyondellBasell N.V. is deemed to have
    begun operations on that date. The results of operations for the
    Successor are not comparable to the Predecessor due to
    adjustments made under fresh-start accounting as



described in “Emergence from Chapter 11
    Proceedings.” The impact of these items is addressed in the
    discussion of each segment’s results below.

The following tables reflect selected financial information for
    our reportable segments. Operating income (loss) for segment
    reporting is on a LIFO basis for the Successor and on a current
    cost basis for the Predecessor.

Olefins
    and Polyolefins — Americas Segment

2010 Versus 2009

— Market demand in the
    U.S. for ethylene was higher in 2010 compared to 2009. As a
    result of higher industry operating rates compared to rates
    experienced during 2009, ethylene margins were higher as
    benchmark sales prices increased significantly more than the
    benchmark weighted average costs of ethylene production. Sales
    of polyolefins in 2010 were comparable to 2009 although
    producers favored domestic market sales over exports due to
    improved domestic demand.

The O&P — Americas segment operating results for
    2010 primarily reflected strong demand and higher margins for
    ethylene due to improved economic conditions in 2010 and
    unplanned operating issues and turnarounds at competitor
    facilities in the first half of the year. Polypropylene results
    were also higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as domestic economic
    conditions improved. Demand for polyethylene in 2010 was
    comparable to 2009. Operating results for the Successor period
    reflected the impacts of the Company’s reorganization and
    fresh-start accounting, including a non-cash charge to adjust
    inventory to market value and the benefit of lower depreciation
    and amortization expense related to the write-down of segment
    assets (see



“Results of Operations — Cost of Sales”).
    The net effect of these items contributed to the significantly
    improved results of operations in the 2010 Successor periods
    compared to the twelve months of 2009.

2009 Versus 2008

— While improving during the
    course of 2009, ethylene market demand in the U.S. remained
    weak, resulting in lower industry operating rates compared to
    rates in the 90% to 95% range during the first eight months of
    2008. Ethylene margins contracted as benchmark sales prices
    decreased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of
    ethylene production. Polyolefins markets were weaker in 2009
    compared to 2008 with the notable exception of
    U.S. polyethylene markets, which benefited from strong
    export demand during 2009.

The O&P — Americas segment operating results for
    2009 primarily reflected the strong polyethylene
    (“PE”) export markets in 2009, lower olefins product
    margins and lower fixed costs. As a result of weak ethylene
    demand during late 2008 and the first half of 2009,
    LyondellBasell AF idled and subsequently shut down the Chocolate
    Bayou olefins plant, near Alvin, Texas. LyondellBasell AF also
    idled and subsequently restarted the La Porte, Texas
    olefins plant in January 2009. Strong PE export markets in 2009,
    benefited PE product margins and sales volumes. However, other
    polyolefins product markets were weaker and resulted in net
    lower sales volumes compared to 2008. As a result of
    LyondellBasell AF’s cost reduction program, fixed costs
    were significantly lower in 2009 compared to 2008.

In the third quarter 2008, operating results were negatively
    impacted by lost production at certain U.S. Gulf Coast
    plants due to the effects of a hurricane.

Ethylene Raw Materials —

Benchmark crude oil
    and natural gas prices generally have been indicators of the
    level and direction of the movement of raw material and energy
    costs for ethylene and its co-products in the
    O&P — Americas segment. Ethylene and its
    co-products are produced from two major raw material groups:

•

crude oil-based liquids (“liquids” or “heavy
    liquids”), including naphtha, condensates, and gas oils,
    the prices of which are generally related to crude oil
    prices; and

•

NGLs, principally ethane and propane, the prices of which are
    generally affected by natural gas prices.

Although the prices of these raw materials are generally related
    to crude oil and natural gas prices, during specific periods the
    relationships among these materials and benchmarks may vary
    significantly.

In the U.S., we have a significant capability to shift the ratio
    of raw materials used in the production of ethylene and its
    co-products to take advantage of the relative costs of heavy
    liquids and NGLs.

In 2010, especially in the latter part of the year, production
    economics for the industry favored NGLs. As a result, we
    increased our use of NGLs and reduced liquids consumption at our
    U.S. plants. During 2010, approximately 70% of our
    U.S. ethylene production was produced from NGLs.

The following table shows the average U.S. benchmark prices
    for crude oil and natural gas for the applicable periods, as
    well as benchmark U.S. sales prices for ethylene and
    propylene, which we produce and sell or consume internally, and
    certain polyethylene and polypropylene products. The benchmark
    weighted



average cost of ethylene production, which is reduced by
    co-product revenues, is based on CMAI’s estimated ratio of
    heavy liquid raw materials and NGLs used in U.S. ethylene
    production.

Revenues

— Revenues in 2010 increased by
    $3,975 million, or 46%, compared to 2009 primarily due to
    significantly higher overall average sales prices and higher
    ethylene and polypropylene sales volumes. The increases in
    average sales prices and sales volumes in 2010 periods reflected
    an increase in demand resulting from improved economic
    conditions and the effect of constrained supply due to operating
    issues and turnarounds at competitor plants. The decrease in
    2009 revenue of $7,798 million, or 48%, compared to 2008,
    reflected the effect of lower average product sales prices and
    net lower sale volumes. Net lower 2009 sales volumes reflected
    the effect of lower sales volumes for polypropylene and ethylene
    and co-products, partly offset by higher sales volumes for
    polyethylene, which benefited from the strong U.S. export
    markets.

Operating Income (Loss)

— Operating results for
    the O&P — Americas segment reflected an increase
    of $1,194 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and an increase
    of $1,524 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The underlying
    operations of the O&P — Americas segment in 2010
    increased compared to 2009, primarily due to higher product
    margins for ethylene as higher average sales prices for ethylene
    and its co-products more than offset higher raw material costs.
    In addition, the effect of higher polypropylene sales volumes
    during 2010 partially offset the effect of higher utility,
    planned maintenance and other costs. Operating results for 2010
    were impacted by a non-cash charge of $34 million to adjust
    inventory to market values. Lower depreciation



and amortization expense of $204 million in 2010 compared
    to 2009 was primarily the result of our write-down of Property,
    plant, and equipment associated with the revaluation of our
    assets in fresh-start accounting.

Compared with 2008, the increase in the 2009
    O&P — Americas operating results reflected the
    benefit of lower fixed costs, resulting from LyondellBasell
    AF’s cost reduction program, partially offset by net lower
    product margins and the effect of net lower sales volumes.
    Operating results for 2008 were negatively affected by the
    $120 million estimated impact of lost production due to
    Hurricane Ike, and related costs of $39 million, including
    a $7 million pretax charge for impairment of the carrying
    value of assets. Operating results for 2008 also included
    inventory valuation adjustments of $619 million and
    goodwill impairment charges of $624 million.

Fourth Quarter 2010 versus Third Quarter 2010

—
    The O&P — Americas segment had operating income
    of $446 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to
    $448 million in the third quarter 2010. Operating results
    in the fourth quarter 2010 included a non-cash benefit of
    $163 million related to inventory market price recovery in
    the fourth quarter 2010, which partially offsets the charges
    recorded in the second and third quarters of 2010 of $171
    million and $26 million, respectively, to adjust inventory
    to market value after the Emergence Date. Excluding the non-cash
    inventory adjustment, the decline in fourth quarter 2010
    operating results was primarily due to a combination of lower
    product margins for polyethylene and polypropylene, lower sales
    volumes, and higher fixed costs. Polyethylene and polypropylene
    product margins declined as the increases in feedstock prices
    outpaced the increases in average sales price. Product margins
    for ethylene were comparable in the third and fourth quarters of
    2010. The decrease in sales volumes was primarily related to the
    effects of seasonality as well as planned and unplanned outages
    during the fourth quarter 2010. Fixed costs were higher in the
    fourth quarter 2010, compared to the third quarter 2010,
    primarily due to higher maintenance costs associated with the
    planned and unplanned outages and bonus expense.

Olefins
    and Polyolefins — Europe, Asia and International
    Segment

2010 Versus 2009

— Ethylene market demand in
    Europe was generally higher in 2010 compared to 2009 as planned
    and unplanned outages resulted in reduced supply and higher
    operating results in the second and third quarters of 2010.
    Ethylene margins expanded as benchmark average sales prices
    increased more than the benchmark weighted average cost of
    ethylene production. Global polyolefin markets also improved in
    2010 compared to 2009. The improvement in polypropylene and LDPE
    reflected tight supply conditions amid planned and unplanned
    industry outages throughout 2010.

The O&P — EAI segment operating results for the
    2010 periods reflected higher product margins for both olefins
    and polyolefins. Higher sales volumes for PP Compounds and
    polypropylene in 2010 compared to 2009, reflect higher demand,
    primarily from the automotive industry. Operating results for
    the Successor period also reflected the impacts of fresh-start
    accounting, including the benefit of lower depreciation and
    amortization expense related to the write-down of segment assets
    (see “Results of Operations-Cost of Sales”).

2009 Versus 2008

— While improving during the
    course of 2009, ethylene market demand in Europe remained weak,
    resulting in lower industry operating rates in the range of 75%
    to 80% compared to rates in the 85% to 90% range prior to the
    fourth quarter downturn in 2008. Ethylene margins contracted as
    benchmark sales prices decreased more than the benchmark
    weighted average cost of ethylene production. Global polyolefin
    markets were considerably weaker in 2009 compared to 2008. The
    general weakness in global polyolefin markets resulted in lower
    sales volumes, due to weaker demand, particularly in
    polypropylene, and lower product margins, as selling prices
    decreased significantly.

The O&P — EAI segment operating results for 2009
    reflected the negative effects of significantly lower product
    margins compared to 2008 for olefins products, while polyolefin
    product results for 2009 reflected generally weaker global
    polyolefin markets, which resulted in lower sales volumes across
    all polyolefins product lines and net lower product margins
    compared to 2008. As a result of LyondellBasell AF’s cost
    reduction program, fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009,
    partly offsetting the negative effects of the weak markets.



Ethylene Raw Materials —

Revenues

— Revenues for 2010 increased
    $3,433 million, or 37%, compared to revenues for 2009, and
    revenues for 2009 decreased $4,088 million, or 30%,
    compared to revenues for 2008. The increase in 2010 revenues,
    compared to 2009, was primarily due to the effect of higher
    average product sales prices across most products, particularly
    ethylene, butadiene, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as
    the effect of higher sales volumes, particularly polypropylene,
    including

Catalloy

and PP Compounds.

The decrease in 2009 revenues compared to 2008 reflected the
    effect of lower product sales prices and net lower sale volumes
    as well as the unfavorable effects of changes in currency
    exchange rates as the U.S. dollar was stronger in relation
    to the Euro in 2009 compared to 2008. Lower 2009 polypropylene
    and ethylene co-product sales volumes were partly offset by
    higher sales volumes for polyethylene and ethylene products.

Operating Income (Loss)

— Operating results for
    2010 increased $528 million compared to 2009 and decreased
    $222 million for 2009 compared to 2008. The underlying
    operating results of our O&P — EAI business
    segment were higher in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily as a
    result of higher product margins for ethylene, butadiene,
    polypropylene and polyethylene, mainly LDPE. Fixed costs were
    also higher in 2010



compared to 2009, reflecting costs related to our maintenance
    program and the start up of the polymers plant in
    Münchsmünster, Germany. Operating results for 2010
    were negatively impacted by a $35 million charge associated
    with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during
    the third quarter 2010 over an environmental indemnity. Lower
    depreciation and amortization expense of $62 million in
    2010 compared to 2009 was primarily a result of our write-down
    of Property, plant and equipment associated with the revaluation
    of our assets in fresh-start accounting.

In 2009, the underlying operations of the O&P —
    EAI segment reflected significantly lower net product margins
    and lower sales volumes, primarily in Europe, offset by the
    benefit of lower fixed costs compared to 2008. The lower fixed
    costs were primarily a result of LyondellBasell AF’s cost
    reduction program.

Income (loss) from equity investments

— Income
    from equity investments for the O&P — EAI segment
    increased $320 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and
    decreased $206 million from 2008 to 2009. We received
    dividends of $40 million from our equity investments during
    2010. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to
    recognition of a $228 million after-tax impairment of the
    carrying value of LyondellBasell AF’s investment in certain
    joint ventures during 2009 as a result of weak current and
    projected market conditions. This loss was based on estimates of
    fair values developed in connection with LyondellBasell
    AF’s estimation of its reorganization enterprise value.

Fourth Quarter 2010 versus Third Quarter 2010

—
    The O&P — EAI segment had operating income of
    $66 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to
    $231 million in the third quarter 2010. Underlying
    operating results reflected a decrease in the fourth quarter
    2010, compared to the third quarter 2010, primarily due to lower
    product margins, particularly ethylene, and to a lesser extent,
    higher fixed costs and the effect of lower sales volumes. The
    lower product margins reflected higher raw material costs while
    the higher fixed costs resulted from higher costs related to our
    maintenance program. The decrease in product margins was
    amplified by the unfavorable effects of changes in currency
    exchange rates as the Euro weakened against the U.S. dollar
    in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter 2010.
    Operating results in the fourth quarter 2010 included an
    $10 million non-cash credit related to inventory market
    price recovery in the fourth quarter 2010, which offsets the
    $5 million inventory adjustments recorded in each of the
    second and third quarters of 2010 to adjust inventory to market
    value after the Emergence Date. Operating results for the third
    quarter 2010 also included a $35 million charge associated
    with a change in estimate related to a dispute that arose during
    that period over an environmental liability.

Intermediates
    and Derivatives Segment

2010 Versus 2009

— Market demand for PO and PO
    derivatives improved in 2010 as the recovery of the automotive
    industry from a particularly weak 2009 and planned and unplanned
    industry outages during 2010 resulted in tightened supply.
    Demand in the Intermediates market also returned to at or above
    pre-recession levels.

The I&D segment’s operating results for 2010 primarily
    reflected higher sales volumes across most products compared to
    2009. The propylene oxide business benefited from planned and
    unplanned competitor downtime in the first half of 2010 as the
    market for durable goods end-uses strengthened. Operating
    results for the Successor periods reflected the impacts of
    fresh-start accounting, including a non-cash charge, in the
    second quarter 2010, to adjust inventory to market value that
    was offset by the benefit of lower depreciation and amortization
    expense related to the write-down of segment assets (see
    “Results of Operations — Cost of Sales”).

2009 Versus 2008

— While improving during the
    course of 2009, markets for PO and PO derivatives, ethylene
    derivatives and other intermediate chemical products generally
    experienced weaker demand in 2009 compared to 2008 particularly
    in durable goods markets.

The I&D segment operating results in 2009 primarily
    reflected the negative effects of lower sales volumes compared
    to 2008. As a result of LyondellBasell AF’s cost reduction
    program, fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009, partly
    offsetting the negative effects of the weak markets. Product
    margins were relatively stable. In response to lower PO demand,
    LyondellBasell AF temporarily idled two PO facilities in late
    2008. In mid-May 2009, LyondellBasell AF restarted one of the
    idled PO facilities, which is located in Europe and



is part of LyondellBasell AF’s joint venture with Bayer
    (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The
    second PO facility restarted in September 2009.

In the third quarter 2008, operating results were negatively
    impacted by lost production at certain U.S. Gulf Coast
    plants due to the effects of a hurricane.

The following table sets forth the Intermediates &
    Derivatives segment’s sales and other operating revenues,
    operating income, income from equity investments and selected
    product sales volumes.

Revenues

— Revenues for 2010 increased
    $1,796 million or, 48% compared to 2009, and revenues for
    2009 decreased $2,440 million or, 39%, compared to revenues
    for 2008. The increase in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009
    reflected increased demand in the current year leading to higher
    sales volumes and higher average sales prices across most
    products, particularly PO, BDO, PG, TBA, and styrene. EO and EG
    sales volumes were lower in 2010 due to planned and unplanned
    maintenance activities during the latter half of 2010. The
    decrease in 2009 revenue compared to 2008 reflected the effect
    of lower product sales prices and net lower sale volumes, a
    trend which began in the latter part of 2008. In addition, the
    unfavorable effects of changes in currency exchange rates
    contributed to the decrease in revenue as the U.S. dollar
    was stronger in relation to the Euro in 2009 compared to 2008.

Operating Income (Loss)

— Operating results for
    2010 for the I&D segment increased $419 million
    compared to 2009 and increased $2,165 for 2009 compared to 2008.
    Operating results for 2010 include an $8 million non-cash
    charge to adjust inventory at December 31, 2010 to market
    value, which was lower than the value at April 30, 2010
    applied during fresh-start accounting. Lower depreciation and
    amortization expense of $104 million in 2010 compared to
    2009 was primarily the result of our write-down of Property,
    plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our
    assets in fresh-start accounting. The remaining increases in
    2010 primarily reflected the favorable effect of significantly
    higher sales volumes for PO and PO derivatives, TBA and styrene.
    Lower product margins for styrene and TBA and derivatives more
    than offset higher product margins for acetyls, EO and EG.

Results in 2009 reflected lower fixed costs compared to 2008 as
    a result of LyondellBasell AF’s cost reduction program, and
    lower utility costs compared to 2008 due to lower natural gas
    prices. Product margins in 2009 were flat compared to 2008, as
    lower product prices were offset by lower raw material costs.
    Results in 2008 were impacted by charges of $1,992 million
    for impairment of goodwill related to the December 20, 2007
    acquisition of Lyondell Chemical and inventory valuation
    adjustments of $65 million.

Fourth Quarter 2010 versus Third Quarter 2010

—
    The I&D segment had operating income of $196 million
    in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $207 million in the
    third quarter 2010. Operating results in the fourth quarter 2010
    included a non-cash benefit of $17 million related to
    inventory market price recovery in the fourth quarter 2010,
    which partially offsets the $25 million charge recorded in
    the second quarter 2010 to adjust inventory to market value
    after the Emergence Date. The segment’s underlying fourth
    quarter 2010



operating results reflect slightly lower product margins higher
    fixed costs. The lower product margins primarily reflected
    higher raw material and utility costs.

Refining
    and Oxyfuels Segment

2010 Versus 2009

— In 2010 compared to 2009,
    benchmark heavy crude refining margins averaged higher,
    primarily due to an increase in the differential between the
    cost of heavy and light crude oil.

Segment operating results in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily
    reflected higher benchmark refining margins and lower crude
    processing rates at the Houston refinery. Crude processing rates
    for the Houston refinery reflected the effects of a crude unit
    fire, sulfur recovery constraints and unplanned outages, while
    the Berre refinery crude processing rates were negatively
    affected by national strikes in France during the fourth quarter
    2010. Oxyfuels results were lower in 2010. Operating results for
    the Successor period reflected the impacts of fresh-start
    accounting, including non-cash charges in the second and third
    quarters of 2010 to adjust inventory to market value, all of
    which was recovered in the fourth quarter 2010, and the benefit
    of lower depreciation and amortization expense related to the
    write-down of segment assets (see “Results of
    Operations — Cost of Sales”).

2009 Versus 2008

— Benchmark refining margins
    for 2009 were lower compared to the same period in 2008,
    generally reflecting the weaker global economy and consequent
    weaker demand for gasoline and distillate products, such as
    diesel and heating oil. The weaker demand resulted in lower
    prices for light crude oil, while OPEC-mandated production cuts
    resulted in lower supplies of heavy crude oil and lower price
    discounts relative to light crude oil. Both factors compressed
    the price differential between light and heavy crude oil.
    Benchmark margins for oxyfuels in 2009 were comparable to 2008.

Refining and Oxyfuels segment operating results in 2009
    primarily reflected the effects of significantly lower
    U.S. refining margins compared to the same period in 2008.
    The operating results of the Berre refinery, which was acquired
    on April 1, 2008, reflected the weak distillate markets in
    2009. Operating results in 2009 benefited from higher margins
    for oxygenated gasoline blending components and lower utility
    and fixed costs, but were negatively affected by outages of some
    of the Houston refinery’s sulfur recovery units during the
    second quarter 2009 and of a crude unit during the fourth
    quarter 2009. As a result of LyondellBasell AF’s cost
    reduction program, fixed costs were significantly lower in 2009
    compared to 2008.

In 2008, operating results were negatively impacted by lost
    production at the Houston refinery due to the effects of a
    hurricane and a scheduled maintenance turnaround of one of the
    refinery’s crude trains and coker units during the third
    quarter 2008 that was delayed by an incident involving a
    contractor’s crane and an unplanned second quarter 2008
    outage of a FCC unit.

The following table sets forth the Refining and Oxyfuels
    segment’s sales and other operating revenues, operating
    income and sales volumes for certain gasoline blending
    components for the applicable periods. In addition, the table
    shows market refining margins for the U.S. and Europe and
    MTBE margins in Northwest



Europe (“NWE”). In the U.S., “WTI,” or West
    Texas Intermediate, is a light crude oil, while “Maya”
    is a heavy crude oil. In Europe, “Urals —
    4-1-2-1” is a measure of West European refining margins.

Revenues

— Revenues for the Refining and
    Oxyfuels segment increased $2,991 million, or 25%, in 2010
    compared to 2009 and decreased $6,284 million, or 34%, from
    2008 to 2009. The increase in revenues from 2009 to 2010 is
    primarily due to higher average sales prices at the Houston and
    Berre refineries. Crude processing rates for the Houston
    refinery were 3% lower, compared to 2009, as a result of a May
    2010 crude unit fire and other planned and unplanned outages
    during 2010. Crude processing rates for the Berre refinery were
    2% higher in 2010, compared to 2009, despite several planned and
    unplanned outages.

The decrease in revenues in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to
    lower sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes at
    the Houston refinery. The decrease during 2009 was partially
    offset by the effect of a full year of operation of the Berre
    refinery, which was acquired April 1, 2008.

Operating Income (Loss)

— Operating results
    increased $499 million in 2010, compared to 2009, and
    increased $2,021 million in 2009, compared to 2008.
    Operating results in 2010 were negatively impacted by a
    $21 million charge associated with a change in estimate
    related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010
    over an environmental indemnity, the impairment of assets
    related to the Berre refinery, and by a crude unit fire in May
    2010 resulting in lost production and $14 million in cash
    costs. Operating results for 2009 included the benefit of
    $50 million from the settlement of hedging activity at the
    Houston refinery related to distillates. Lower depreciation and
    amortization expense of $269 million in 2010 compared to
    2009 was primarily the result of the write-down of Property,
    plant and equipment associated with the revaluation of our
    assets in fresh-start accounting. Apart from the effects of the
    items listed above, increases in operating results for 2010 were
    primarily due to higher refining margins, especially at the
    Houston refinery, partially offset by lower product margins for
    oxyfuels. The decreased oxyfuels margins in 2010 are primarily
    due to the normalization of margins in 2010 compared to the
    exceptional margins achieved in 2009.



Operating results in 2009 were negatively affected by lower
    crude refining margins, partially offset by lower utility costs
    due to lower natural gas prices and lower fixed costs. The
    latter reflected LyondellBasell AF’s cost reduction
    program. The lower refining margins were primarily attributable
    to U.S. refining markets, although margins were lower for
    both the Houston and Berre refineries. In 2008, operating
    results were negatively impacted by scheduled maintenance
    turnarounds of crude and coker units and the related July 2008
    crane incident at the Houston refinery, as well as by operating
    disruptions related to Hurricane Ike by an estimated
    $205 million. In addition to the turnaround and hurricane
    effects, operating results were negatively affected by an
    estimated $220 million as a result of lost production due
    to unplanned maintenance at the Houston refinery’s FCC and
    other operating units. Operating results were also negatively
    impacted by impairment charges against goodwill of
    $2,305 million and other assets of $218 million and
    inventory valuation adjustments of $442 million.

Fourth Quarter 2010 versus Third Quarter 2010 —

The Refining and Oxyfuels segment had operating income of
    $144 million in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to
    $83 million in the third quarter 2010. Operating results in
    the fourth quarter 2010 reflect the non-cash benefit of
    $132 million related to inventory market price recovery,
    which offsets the lower of cost or market charges recorded in
    the second and third quarters of 2010 of $132 million and
    $1 million, respectively, and the impairment of assets
    related to the Berre refinery. Third quarter 2010 operating
    results include the $21 million charge associated with a
    change in estimate related to a dispute over an environmental
    indemnity. The underlying operating results of the Refining and
    Oxyfuels business segment decreased in the fourth quarter 2010
    primarily due to lower overall sales volumes, partially offset
    by higher refining margins at both the Houston and Berre
    refineries. Crude processing rates for the Houston refinery were
    11% lower compared to the third quarter 2010, reflecting the
    effect of unplanned outages during the fourth quarter, while
    crude processing rates in the fourth quarter 2010 for the Berre
    refinery were only slightly lower compared to the third quarter
    2010. Refining margins during the fourth quarter reflected the
    effect of higher average sales prices resulting from, in the
    case of the Berre refinery, the disruption due to the national
    strikes in France. Normal seasonal declines affected oxyfuels
    product margins and sales volumes during the fourth quarter
    2010. The seasonal decline in margins was steeper than usual as
    the price of feedstocks, butane and ethanol, rose rapidly due to
    cold weather and a poor grain harvest, respectively.

Technology
    Segment

2010 Versus 2009

— The Technology segment
    results in 2010 were negatively impacted by lower licensing
    revenue, reflecting a slowdown in new polyolefin projects as a
    consequence of the economic crisis beginning late in the fourth
    quarter 2008. Higher sales volumes for catalysts partially
    offset the results for process licenses. The negative effect of
    a strengthening U.S. dollar versus the Euro in 2010 also
    negatively impacted the Technology segment’s 2010 results.

2009 Versus 2008

— Technology segment results
    for 2009 were primarily affected by lower license revenue,
    reflecting weaker global markets compared to 2008. The segment
    results also reflected the negative effects of changes in
    currency exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened
    versus the Euro. The 2009 results benefited from lower R&D
    expense, reflecting LyondellBasell AF’s cost reduction
    program and a government subsidy, and the effects of higher
    catalyst sales volumes.

The following table sets forth the Technology segment’s
    sales and other operating revenues and operating income.

Revenues

— Revenues for 2010 decreased
    $33 million, or 6% compared to 2009 and decreased
    $40 million, or 7% from 2008 to 2009. The decreases in 2010
    and 2009 revenues were attributable to lower process license
    revenue, partially offset by higher catalyst sales volumes. In
    addition, currency exchange rates had an unfavorable effect on
    operating income of

non-U.S. operations

as the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro in both
    periods.

Operating Income

— Operating income for 2010
    for the Technology segment decreased $102 million compared
    to 2009 and increased $8 million from 2008 to 2009.
    Operating income for 2010 was negatively affected by an
    $8 million charge associated with a change in estimate
    related to a dispute that arose during the third quarter 2010
    over an environmental indemnity and by a $17 million charge
    related to the sale, in 2010, of higher cost inventory. The
    remaining decrease in operating income in 2010 compared to 2009
    was the result of lower licensing revenue, and to a lesser
    extent, the negative effects of a strengthening U.S. dollar
    versus the Euro in 2010 compared to 2009. These decreases in
    2010 operating results were only partly offset by the effect of
    increased catalyst sales volumes in 2010. Operating income in
    2009 also included the benefit of a government subsidy
    recognized as a reduction of R&D expense.

The $8 million increase in operating income in 2009,
    compared to 2008, was primarily the result of higher catalysts
    sales volumes, partly offset by an unfavorable effect from
    changes in currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates had
    an unfavorable effect on operating income as the
    U.S. dollar strengthened versus the Euro in 2009 compared
    to 2008.

Fourth Quarter 2010 versus Third Quarter 2010

—
    The Technology segment had operating income of $8 million
    in the fourth quarter 2010 compared to $38 million in the
    third quarter 2010. Apart from a fourth quarter 2010 charge of
    $17 million related to the sale of higher cost inventory
    during the year and an $8 million charge related to a
    dispute over environmental liability, operating results in the
    fourth quarter 2010 reflected lower licensing income and the
    effect of lower sales volumes for catalysts, compared to the
    third quarter 2010.

Operating Activities

— Cash provided in the
    combined Successor and Predecessor periods of 2010 primarily
    reflected an increase in earnings offset by payments for
    reorganization items, claims under the Plan of Reorganization,
    and certain annual payments relating to sales rebates, employee
    bonuses, property taxes and insurance premiums. The use of cash
    in 2009 primarily reflected a $573 million increase in cash
    used by the main components of working capital —
    accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts
    payable — and $329 million of vendor prepayments
    that were required by certain third parties as a result of
    LyondellBasell AF’s chapter 11 filing.

In 2010, the main components of working capital —
    accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable used
    cash of $456 million compared to $573 million in 2009.
    The increase in these components of working capital during 2010
    reflected a $702 million increase in accounts receivable
    due to higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes and
    a $395 million increase in inventory, partially offset by a



$641 million increase in accounts payable due to the higher
    costs and volumes of feedstocks, and more favorable payment
    terms.

Changes in the main components of working capital used cash of
    $573 million in 2009 and provided cash of $747 million
    in 2008. The increase in cash used by the main components of
    working capital in 2009 primarily reflected a $503 million
    repayment that was required in connection with the termination
    of an accounts receivable securitization program in early 2009.
    Operationally, cash used by the main components of working
    capital increased by only $70 million, despite the effect
    of rising prices during 2009, as the Company focused on reducing
    working capital levels.

In 2008, the $747 million of cash provided by the main
    components of working capital primarily reflected the effects of
    declining crude oil prices on sales prices and the value of
    inventory; the disruptive effects of Hurricane Ike on the
    Company’s Gulf Coast operations; and the planned and
    unplanned outages related to a turnaround at the Houston
    Refinery. Other factors impacting the main components of working
    capital included a general tightening of credit in the industry
    and the delay, in December 2008 of certain payments.

Investing Activities

— Cash used in investing
    activities in 2010 included $692 million of capital
    expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of $154 million
    from the sale of our F&F business in December 2010 and
    $12 million in proceeds from a money market fund that had
    suspended rights to redemption in 2008, as described below.

The cash used in 2009 primarily included $779 million of
    capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds of
    $120 million from insurance claims, $20 million from
    sales of assets, and $23 million from a net reduction of
    short-term investments. The cash provided by insurance claims
    related to damages sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in
    Münchsmünster, Germany.

The cash used in 2008 was primarily related to business
    acquisitions and capital expenditures, partially offset by
    proceeds from the sales of assets and insurance claims related
    to the polymers plant in Münchsmünster, Germany.
    Acquisitions in 2008 included the April 2008 acquisition of the
    Shell oil refinery, inventory and associated infrastructure and
    businesses at our Berre Refinery for a purchase price of
    $927 million, including final adjustment for working
    capital and the February 2008 acquisition of Solvay Engineered
    Polymers, Inc., a leading supplier of polypropylene compounds in
    North America, for $134 million (see Note 5 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements). Asset sales included the
    September 2008 sale of the TDI business for proceeds of
    €77 million ($113 million) and the July 2008 sale
    of a Canadian plant for proceeds of $18 million. As a
    result of financial difficulties experienced by major financial
    institutions beginning in the latter part of 2008,
    LyondellBasell AF received notice that rights of redemption had
    been suspended with respect to a money market fund in which
    LyondellBasell AF had invested approximately $174 million.
    LyondellBasell AF subsequently redeemed a total of
    $172 million, including $137 million in 2008,
    $23 million in 2009 and $12 million in January 2010.

The capital expenditures presented in the table above exclude
    costs of major periodic maintenance and repair activities,
    including turnarounds and catalyst recharges of
    $71 million, $39 million and $164 million in the
    Predecessor periods of 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Financing Activities

— The cash used in the
    Successor period primarily reflects the repayment of debt in the
    fourth quarter of 2010. In December 2010, we redeemed
    $225 million and €37.5 million ($50 million)
    of our 8% Senior Secured Notes due 2017, comprising 10% of
    the outstanding senior secured dollar notes and senior secured
    Euro notes, respectively. In conjunction with the redemption of
    the notes, we paid premiums totaling $8 million. Also in
    2010, we repaid $495 million of the Senior Term Loan
    Facility, including a mandatory quarterly amortization payment
    of $1 million and a prepayment, at par, of
    $494 million in December 2010.

Since the Emergence Date, we made net payments totaling
    $398 million under the European Securitization Facility,
    which includes the entire outstanding balance in October 2010.
    We also made net payments of $14 million under our accounts
    receivable factoring facility during the Successor period.

As part of our emergence from bankruptcy, we received gross
    proceeds of $2,800 million on April 30, 2010 in
    connection with the issuance of shares in a rights offering and
    paid $86 million of fees, including $70 million of
    fees to equity backstop providers. On April 30, 2010 we
    also received net proceeds of $3,242 million from the
    issuance of new debt by our subsidiary, Lyondell Chemical,
    including Senior Secured Notes in the amounts of
    $2,250 million and €375 million
    ($497 million) and from proceeds of the Senior Term Loan
    facility of $495 million. Proceeds from the rights offering
    and the Senior Notes, along with borrowings under the Senior
    Term Loan Facility and the amended and restated European
    Securitization, were used to repay outstanding amounts of
    $2,167 million under the DIP New Money Term Loan,
    $985 million under the DIP ABL Facility and to pay a
    $195 million exit fee required under the DIP financing. We
    also paid fees totaling $92 million in connection with our
    new U.S. ABL Facility and amended and restated European
    Securitization facility. Predecessor debt classified as
    Liabilities subject to compromise immediately prior to emergence
    from bankruptcy was discharged pursuant to the Plan of
    Reorganization (see Note 4 to Consolidated Financial
    Statements).

Apart from the payments reflected above, during the 2010
    Predecessor period, we repaid a $5 million Argentinean
    loan; made a $12 million mandatory quarterly amortization
    payment of the Dutch Tranche A Dollar Term Loan,
    $3 million of which was related to the DIP

Roll-Up

Loans; and made payments of



$8 million on the French Factoring Facility. In addition,
    we made payments totaling $13 million related to the
    extension of the DIP financing. We also had a net increase in
    borrowings of $47 million under the European Securitization
    facility in the 2010 Predecessor period.

In 2009, LyondellBasell AF borrowed $2,167 million under a
    DIP financing arrangement, receiving net proceeds of
    $2,089 million and subsequently paid additional bank fees
    of $97 million. In addition, LyondellBasell AF paid fees of
    $93 million related to the issuance of the DIP ABL
    facility, and at December 31, 2009 had $325 million of
    net borrowings outstanding under this facility.

The chapter 11 filing in 2009 constituted a termination
    event under the asset-based credit facilities in the U.S., and
    LyondellBasell AF used $880 million of the net proceeds
    under the DIP financing arrangement to repay $766 million
    and $114 million outstanding under the previous
    inventory-based credit facility and the North American accounts
    receivable securitization program, respectively. As noted under
    Operating Activities, LyondellBasell AF also used
    $503 million to repurchase outstanding accounts receivable
    sold under its previous $1,150 million receivables
    securitization facility. In addition, LyondellBasell AF repaid a
    $100 million demand note related to emergency postpetition
    funding. In 2009, LyondellBasell AF made net repayments totaling
    $201 million under its European receivables securitization
    program, which was amended and restated in March 2009.
    LyondellBasell AF repaid $45 million (70 million
    Australian dollars) outstanding under an Australian term loan
    and $11 million of other loans, including $6 million
    outstanding under an Argentinean bank loan, and made mandatory
    quarterly amortization payments of the Dutch Tranche A
    Dollar Term Loan totaling $24 million, $6 million of
    which was related to the DIP financing.

A non-debtor subsidiary of LyondellBasell AF entered into an
    accounts receivable factoring agreement in 2009 under which it
    received $24 million of proceeds. See the “Accounts
    Receivable Factoring Agreement” section in “Liquidity
    and Capital Resources.” Also in 2009, LyondellBasell AF
    received $18 million of proceeds from an Argentinean bank
    loan and borrowed $17 million related to a letter of credit
    presented for payment under the prepetition senior secured
    revolving credit facility.

LyondellBasell AF had an additional $21 million of cash
    used by financing activities, primarily related to the effects
    of bank overdrafts.

The cash provided in 2008 primarily reflected net
    $1,510 million borrowed under LyondellBasell AF’s
    credit facilities offset by $384 million of long-term debt
    repayments. The borrowings were used to fund the business
    acquisitions described in the “Investing Activities”
    section above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

— As of
    December 31, 2010, we had cash on hand of
    $4,222 million. In addition, we had total unused
    availability under our credit facilities of $1,883 million
    at December 31, 2010, which included the following:

•

$1,380 million under our $1,750 million U.S. ABL
    facility, which matures in 2014. Availability under the
    U.S. ABL facility is subject to a borrowing base of
    $1,750 million at December 31, 2010, and is reduced to
    the extent of outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of
    credit provided under the facility. At December 31, 2010,
    we had $370 million of outstanding letters of credit and no
    outstanding borrowings under the facility.

•

€368 million and $16 million (totaling
    approximately $503 million) under our
    €450 million European receivables securitization
    facility. Availability under the European receivables
    securitization facility is subject to a borrowing base
    comprising €368 million and $16 million in effect
    as of December 31, 2010. There were no outstanding
    borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2010.

In October 2010, we provided the lenders under our accounts
    receivable factoring facility with notice of our intent to
    terminate the agreement. The facility was repaid in full in
    November 2010 and terminated.

We may use cash on hand, cash from operating activities and
    proceeds from asset divestitures to repay debt, which may
    include additional purchases of our outstanding bonds in the
    open market or otherwise. We also plan to finance our ongoing
    working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other
    funding requirements through our future financial and operating
    performance, which could be affected by general economic,
    financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and
    other factors, many of which are beyond



our control. We believe that our cash, cash from operating
    activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities
    provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our
    anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come
    due.

At December 31, 2010, we had total short-term and long-term
    debt, including current maturities, of $6,082 million. At
    December 31, 2010, our $4 million of current
    maturities of long-term debt comprises various

non-U.S. loans.

We are seeking to amend and restate our Senior Secured Term Loan
    Agreement to, among other things, modify certain restrictive
    covenants.

Receivables securitization

— On May 4,
    2010, we amended and restated an existing securitization
    agreement under which two of our

non-U.S. subsidiaries

may sell, subject to a borrowing base, up to
    €450 million in trade receivables. Transfers of
    accounts receivable under this three-year program do not qualify
    as sales; therefore, the transferred accounts receivable and the
    proceeds received through such transfers are included in trade
    receivables, net, and short-term debt in the consolidated
    balance sheets. There were no borrowings under this facility as
    of December 31, 2010.

Contractual and Other Obligations

— The
    following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2010, our
    minimum payments for long-term debt, including current
    maturities, short-term debt, and contractual and other
    obligations for the next five years and thereafter.

Total Debt

— Total debt includes our 8%
    U.S. dollar and Euro Senior Secured Notes due 2017, Senior
    Secured Term Loan Facility due 2016, 11% Senior Secured
    Notes due 2018, 8.1% guaranteed notes due 2027 (the “2027
    Notes”) and various

non-U.S. loans.

See Note 15 for a discussion of covenant requirements under
    the credit facilities and indentures and additional information
    regarding our debt facilities.

Interest

— Our debt and related party debt
    agreements contain provisions for the payment of monthly,
    quarterly or semi-annual interest at a stated rate of interest
    over the term of the debt.

Pension Benefits

— We maintain several defined
    benefit pension plans, as described in Note 18 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2010,
    the projected benefit obligation for our pension plans exceeded
    the fair value of plan assets by $1,173 million. Subject to
    future actuarial gains and losses, as well as actual asset
    earnings, we, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, will
    be required to fund the



$1,173 million, with interest, in future years. We
    contributed $99 million to our pension plans in 2010 and
    LyondellBasell AF made contributions to the plans of
    $52 million in 2009 and $80 million in 2008. In
    January 2011, we contributed $155 million of the
    approximately $287 million of required contributions that
    we expect to make to our pension plans in 2011. Estimates of
    pension benefit payments through 2015 are included in the table
    above.

Other Postretirement Benefits

— We provide
    other postretirement benefits, primarily medical benefits to
    eligible participants, as described in Note 18 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. We pay other unfunded
    postretirement benefits as incurred. Estimates of other
    postretirement benefit payments through 2015 are included in the
    table above.

Advances from Customers

— We are obligated to
    deliver product, primarily at cost-based prices, in connection
    with long-term sales agreements under which our Predecessor
    received advances from customers in prior years. These advances
    are treated as deferred revenue and will be amortized to
    earnings as product is delivered over the remaining terms of the
    respective contracts, which primarily range from 4 to
    8 years. The unamortized long-term portion of such advances
    totaled $101 million as of December 31, 2010.

Other

— Other primarily consists of accruals
    for environmental remediation costs, obligations under deferred
    compensation arrangements, and anticipated asset retirement
    obligations. See “Critical Accounting Policies” below
    for a discussion of obligations for environmental remediation
    costs.

Deferred Income Taxes

— The scheduled
    settlement of the deferred tax liabilities shown in the table is
    based on the scheduled reversal of the underlying temporary
    differences. Actual cash tax payments will vary depending upon
    future taxable income.

Purchase Obligations

— We are party to various
    obligations to purchase products and services, principally for
    raw materials, utilities and industrial gases. These commitments
    are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to
    be in excess of normal requirements. The commitments are
    segregated into

take-or-pay

contracts and other contracts. Under the

take-or-pay

contracts, we are obligated to make minimum payments whether or
    not we take the product or service. Other contracts include
    contracts that specify minimum quantities; however, in the event
    that we do not take the contractual minimum, we are only
    obligated for any resulting economic loss suffered by the
    vendor. The payments shown for the other contracts assume that
    minimum quantities are purchased. For contracts with variable
    pricing terms, the minimum payments reflect the contract price
    at December 31, 2010.

Operating Leases

— We lease various facilities
    and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various
    periods. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for related lease disclosures.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We have related party transactions with certain of our major
    shareholders and their affiliates and our joint venture
    partners. We believe that such transactions are effected on
    terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that
    would have been agreed upon by unrelated parties on an
    arm’s length basis.

LyondellBasell AF had related party transactions with its equity
    investees and its affiliates as well as a member of its Board of
    Directors (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). In addition, prior to the Emergence Date,
    LyondellBasell AF had related party transactions with Access
    Industries.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Management applies those accounting policies that it believes
    best reflect the underlying business and economic events,
    consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements). Our more critical accounting policies include those
    related to the valuation of inventory, long-lived assets, the
    valuation of goodwill, accruals for long-term employee benefit
    costs such as pension and other postretirement costs,
    liabilities for anticipated expenditures to comply with
    environmental regulations, and accruals for taxes based on
    income. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions
    and estimates made by management. Management periodically
    updates its estimates used in the preparation of the



financial statements based on its latest assessment of the
    current and projected business and general economic environment.
    Changes to these critical accounting policies have been reviewed
    with LyondellBasell N.V.’s Supervisory Board.

Inventory

— LyondellBasell N.V. adopted the
    LIFO method of accounting for inventory upon implementation of
    fresh-start accounting. In conjunction with the implementation
    of fresh-start accounting on April 30, 2010, the Company
    recorded its inventory, which is primarily crude-oil derived, at
    fair value. The resulting increase in inventory was primarily in
    the U.S. and was largely driven by the price of crude oil.
    The per barrel benchmark price of WTI crude oil at
    April 30, 2010 had increased to $86.15. The price of crude
    oil is subject to many factors, including changes in economic
    conditions. The fluctuation in the price of crude oil from
    period to period may result in the recognition of charges to
    adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in
    periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in
    subsequent periods as market prices recover. Accordingly, our
    cost of sales and results of operations may be affected by such
    fluctuations.

Following the revaluation of our inventory on April 30,
    2010, the per barrel benchmark price of WTI crude oil declined
    to $75.63 on June 30, 2010, resulting in a
    $333 million lower of cost or market adjustment primarily
    to the Company’s raw materials and finished goods inventory
    and associated increase in cost of sales for the period from May
    1 through June 30, 2010. In the third quarter 2010, as a
    result of lower market prices for certain of the Company’s
    finished goods inventory, the Company recorded a non-cash charge
    of $32 million to adjust the value to the lower of cost or
    market. The recovery of the market price of crude oil in the
    fourth quarter of 2010, resulted in a non-cash credit of
    $323 million to earnings.

Long-Lived Assets

— With respect to long-lived
    assets, key assumptions included the estimates of the asset fair
    values and useful lives at the Emergence Date and the
    recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets and other
    intangible assets, as well as the existence of any obligations
    associated with the retirement of fixed assets. Such estimates
    could be significantly modified

and/or

the
    carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors
    as new technological developments, new chemical industry
    entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages,
    uncertainties associated with the European, U.S. and world
    economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining
    industries, and uncertainties associated with governmental
    actions, whether regulatory or, in the case of Houston refinery,
    with respect to its crude oil contract.

Earnings in the 2010 Successor period included a pretax charge
    of $28 million primarily related to impairment of the
    carrying value of capital additions at our Berre refinery
    following an analysis of its discounted cash flow projections.

Predecessor earnings for 2009 included pretax impairment charges
    of $17 million, primarily related to the impairment of
    LyondellBasell AF’s emissions allowances that are subject
    to reallocation to other industry participants under a proposed
    regulation by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. As
    part of its reorganization, LyondellBasell AF also recognized
    charges totaling $679 million, including $624 million
    for the write off of the carrying value and related assets of
    its Chocolate Bayou olefins facility near Alvin, Texas and
    $55 million for the write off of its ethylene glycol
    facility in Beaumont, Texas.

Predecessor earnings for 2008 included a $218 million
    pretax charge for impairment of the carrying value of the assets
    related to LyondellBasell AF’s Berre Refinery. Also in
    2008, LyondellBasell AF recognized a $7 million charge for
    impairment of its ethylene glycol facility in Beaumont, Texas.

For purposes of recognition and measurement of the above-noted
    impairments, long-lived assets were grouped with other assets
    and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash
    flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets
    and liabilities.

The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from 3 to
    30 years. Depreciation and amortization of these assets,
    including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the
    straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled
    $1,123 million in 2010, including $558 million in the
    Successor period. Based upon the estimated fair values and
    re-assessed useful lives at the Emergence Date, depreciation and
    amortization would be approximately $850 million per year.
    If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than
    originally estimated, depreciation and amortization charges
    would be accelerated over the revised useful life.



Goodwill

— Goodwill of $787 million at
    December 31, 2010 represents the tax effect of the
    differences between the tax and book bases of the Company’s
    assets and liabilities resulting from the Company’s
    revaluation of those assets and liabilities to fair value in
    connection with the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy and
    adoption of fresh-start accounting. LyondellBasell N.V.
    evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability is
    determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the
    reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying
    value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit.

The recoverability of LyondellBasell N.V.’s goodwill is
    dependent upon the future operating results associated with its
    reporting units, which could change significantly based upon
    business performance or other factors.

Long-Term Employee Benefit Costs

— The costs to
    LyondellBasell N.V. of long-term employee benefits, particularly
    pension and other postretirement medical and life insurance
    benefits, are incurred over long periods of time, and involve
    many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit
    cost attributable to current periods is based on several
    assumptions about such future uncertainties, and is sensitive to
    changes in those assumptions. It is management’s
    responsibility, often with the assistance of independent
    experts, to select assumptions that in its judgment represent
    its best estimates of the future effects of those uncertainties.
    It also is management’s responsibility to review those
    assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other
    factors that affect those assumptions.

The current benefit service costs, as well as the existing
    liabilities, for pensions and other postretirement benefits are
    measured on a discounted present value basis. The discount rate
    is a current rate, related to the rate at which the liabilities
    could be settled. LyondellBasell N.V.’s assumed discount
    rate is based on published average rates for high-quality (Aa
    rating) ten-year fixed income securities. For the purpose of
    measuring the benefit obligations at December 31, 2010,
    LyondellBasell N.V. used a discount rate of 5.25% for most
    U.S. plans while a rate of 5.0% was used for certain
    U.S. plans to reflect the different terms of the related
    benefit obligations. The discount rate used to measure
    obligations for

non-U.S. plans

at December 31, 2010 was 4.97%, reflecting market interest
    rates. The discount rates in effect at December 31, 2010
    will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during 2011.

The benefit obligation and the periodic cost of other
    postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on
    assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of
    covered health care benefits. As of December 31, 2010, the
    assumed rate of increase for our U.S. plans was 9.1%,
    decreasing to 5% in 2026 and thereafter. The assumed rate of
    increase for our Canadian plans, as of December 31, 2010,
    was 8.5%, decreasing to 5% in 2018 and thereafter. A one
    percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate
    assumption would have no significant effect on either the
    benefit liability or the net periodic cost, due to limits on
    LyondellBasell N.V.’s maximum contribution level under the
    medical plan.

The net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense
    also is affected by the expected long-term rate of return on
    plan assets assumption. Investment returns that are recognized
    currently in net income represent the expected long-term rate of
    return on plan assets applied to a market-related value of plan
    assets which, for LyondellBasell N.V., is defined as the market
    value of assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is a
    longer term rate, and is expected to change less frequently than
    the current assumed discount rate, reflecting long-term market
    expectations, rather than current fluctuations in market
    conditions.

The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on
    U.S. and

non-U.S. plan

assets of 8% and 6.24%, respectively, is based on the average
    level of earnings that its independent pension investment
    advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time.
    The expectation is based on an asset allocation that varies by
    region. The asset allocations are summarized in Note 18 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements. The actual returns in
    2010 for U.S. and non- U.S. plan assets were 15.6% and
    8.4%, respectively.

The actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the
    expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in
    capital markets. Management’s goal is to manage the
    investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with
    an acceptable level of risk and volatility.



Net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the
    expected asset earnings, rather than the actual earnings or
    loss. This unrecognized amount, to the extent it exceeds 10% of
    the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan, is
    recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the
    average remaining service period of the participants in each
    plan.

In May 2010, LyondellBasell N.V. resumed matching contributions
    under its defined contribution plans (the 401(k) Employee
    Savings Plans). LyondellBasell AF had temporarily suspended its
    matching contributions under the Company’s defined
    contribution plans beginning in March 2009 as a result of the
    bankruptcy.

Additional information on the key assumptions underlying these
    benefit costs appears in Note 18 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Liabilities for Environmental Remediation
    Costs

— Anticipated expenditures related to
    investigation and remediation of contaminated sites, which
    include current and former plant sites and other remediation
    sites, are accrued when it is probable a liability has been
    incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated. Only ongoing operating and monitoring costs, the
    timing of which can be determined with reasonable certainty, are
    discounted to present value. Future legal costs associated with
    such matters, which generally are not estimable, are not
    included in these liabilities.

As of December 31, 2010, LyondellBasell N.V.’s accrued
    liability for future environmental remediation costs at current
    and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled
    $107 million. The liabilities for individual sites range
    from less than $1 million to $37 million, and
    remediation expenditures are expected to occur over a number of
    years, and not to be concentrated in any single year. In the
    opinion of management, it is reasonably possible that losses in
    excess of the liabilities recorded for environmental remediation
    may have been incurred. However, we cannot estimate any amount
    or range of such possible additional losses. New information
    about sites, new technology or future developments such as
    involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies, could
    require LyondellBasell N.V. to reassess potential exposure
    related to environmental matters. See Note 21 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    environmental remediation matters.

Accruals for Taxes Based on Income

— The
    determination of our provision for income taxes and the
    calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities is subject to
    management’s estimates and judgments due to the complexity
    of the tax laws and regulations in the tax jurisdictions in
    which we operate. Uncertainties exist with respect to
    interpretation of these complex laws and regulations.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
    temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
    amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
    tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
    apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
    differences are expected to reverse.

We recognize future tax benefits to the extent that the
    realization of these benefits is more likely than not. Our
    current provision for income taxes was impacted significantly by
    the initial recognition of valuation allowances related to net
    deferred assets in certain

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

Further changes to these valuation allowances may impact our
    future provision for income taxes, which will include no tax
    benefit with respect to losses incurred and no tax expense with
    respect to income generated in these countries until the
    respective valuation allowance is eliminated.

For further information related to our income taxes, see
    Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of
    LyondellBasell N.V. for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    See Note 24 to LyondellBasell AF’s Consolidated
    Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009
    for further information related to income taxes in the
    predecessor periods.



Accounting
    and Reporting Changes

For a discussion of the potential impact of new accounting
    pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, see
    Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    discussion of LyondellBasell N.V.’s management of commodity
    price risk, foreign currency exposure and interest rate risk
    through its use of derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Commodity
    Price Risk

A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are
    commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand
    fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the level
    of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the
    business cycle. We try to protect against such instability
    through various business strategies. These include provisions in
    sales contracts allowing us to pass on higher raw material costs
    through timely price increases, formula price contracts to
    transfer or share commodity price risk, and increasing the depth
    and breadth of our product portfolio.

In addition, we selectively use commodity swap, option, and
    futures contracts with various terms to manage the volatility
    related to purchases of natural gas and raw materials, as well
    as product sales. Such contracts are generally limited to
    durations of one year or less. Cash-flow hedge accounting may be
    elected for these derivative transactions; however, in some
    cases, when the duration of a derivative is short, hedge
    accounting is not elected. When hedge accounting is not elected,
    the changes in fair value of these instruments will be recorded
    in earnings. When hedge accounting is elected, gains and losses
    on these instruments will be deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (“AOCI”), to the extent that the
    hedge remains effective, until the underlying transaction is
    recognized in earnings. Market risks created by these derivative
    instruments and the

mark-to-market

valuations of open positions are monitored by management.

During 2010, we entered into futures contracts with respect to
    sales of gasoline and heating oil, and purchases of crude oil
    and sales of gasoline. At December 31, 2010, futures
    contracts for 28 million gallons of gasoline and heating
    oil in the notional amount of $70 million, maturing in
    February 2011, were outstanding.

We use value at risk (“VAR”), stress testing and
    scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR
    estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values,
    given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time,
    using specified confidence levels. Using sensitivity analysis
    and hypothetical unfavorable changes in market prices ranging
    from 27% to 28% from those in effect at December 31, 2010,
    the effect would be to reduce net income by less than
    $1 million. The quantitative information about market risk
    is necessarily limited because it does not take into account the
    effects of the underlying operating transactions.

Foreign
    Exchange Risk

We manufacture and market our products in a number of countries
    throughout the world and, as a result, are exposed to changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates. Costs in some countries are
    incurred, in part, in currencies other than the applicable
    functional currency.

We enter into transactions denominated in other than the
    functional currency and are, therefore, exposed to foreign
    currency risk on receivables and payables. We maintain risk
    management control systems intended to monitor foreign currency
    risk attributable to both the outstanding foreign currency
    balances and future commitments. The risk management control
    systems involve the centralization of foreign currency exposure
    management, offsetting exposures and estimating the expected
    impacts of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings. We
    enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the
    effects of our net currency exchange exposures. For the 2010
    Successor and Predecessor periods and the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, other income (loss), net, in
    the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected a gain of
    $18 million, losses of $258 million and gains of
    $123 million and $20 million, respectively, in net
    exchange rate gains and



losses. For forward contracts that economically hedge recognized
    monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, no hedge
    accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of foreign
    currency forward contracts are reported in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income and offset the currency exchange results
    recognized on the assets and liabilities.

Interest
    Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable
    rate debt. Our variable rate debt consists of our
    $1,750 million U.S. asset-based facility and our
    receivable securitization facility. At December 31, 2010,
    there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and stockholders of LyondellBasell
    Industries N.V.,

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as
    of December 31, 2010 and the related consolidated statement
    of income, of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and of cash
    flows for the period from May 1, 2010 through
    December 31, 2010 present fairly, in all material respects,
    the financial position of LyondellBasell Industries N.V. and its
    subsidiaries (the “Successor Company”) at
    December 31, 2010 and the results of their operations and
    their cash flows for the period from May 1, 2010 through
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the Successor
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
    conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the
    standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
    audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
    the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
    statements, in 2009 LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A.
    (“the Predecessor Company”), its
    U.S. subsidiaries and a German subsidiary, each filed a
    voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for
    reorganization under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the
    United States Bankruptcy Code. The Predecessor Company’s
    Third Amended and Restated Plan of Reorganization was confirmed
    on April 23, 2010 and the Debtors emerged from
    Chapter 11 protection on April 30, 2010. As of the
    Emergence Date, the Predecessor Company’s equity interests
    in its indirect subsidiaries terminated and the Successor
    Company now owns and operates, directly and indirectly,
    substantially the same business as the Predecessor Company owned
    and operated prior to emergence from the Bankruptcy Cases. In
    connection with its emergence from bankruptcy, the Successor
    Company adopted fresh start accounting on May 1, 2010.

Description
    of Company and Operations

LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is a limited liability company
    (

Naamloze Vennootschap

) incorporated under Dutch law by
    deed of incorporation dated October 15, 2009.
    LyondellBasell Industries N.V. was formed to serve as the parent
    holding company for certain subsidiaries of LyondellBasell
    Industries AF S.C.A. (together with its subsidiaries,
    “LyondellBasell AF,” the “Predecessor
    Company” or the “Predecessor”) after completion
    of proceedings under chapter 11
    (“chapter 11”) of title 11 of the United
    States Bankruptcy Code (the “U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code”). LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A. and 93 of its
    subsidiaries were debtors (“the Debtors”) in jointly
    administered bankruptcy cases (the “Bankruptcy Cases”)
    in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District
    of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). As of
    April 30, 2010 (the “Emergence Date”),
    LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A.’s equity interests in
    its indirect subsidiaries terminated and LyondellBasell
    Industries N.V. now owns and operates, directly and indirectly,
    substantially the same business as LyondellBasell Industries AF
    S.C.A. owned and operated prior to emergence from the Bankruptcy
    Cases, which business includes subsidiaries of LyondellBasell
    Industries AF S.C.A. that were not involved in the Bankruptcy
    Cases. LyondellBasell Industries N.V. is the successor to the
    combination in December 2007 of Lyondell Chemical Company
    (“Lyondell Chemical”) and Basell AF S.C.A.
    (“Basell”), which created one of the world’s
    largest private petrochemical companies with significant
    worldwide scale and leading product positions. LyondellBasell
    Industries AF S.C.A. is no longer part of the LyondellBasell
    group.

LyondellBasell Industries N.V., together with its consolidated
    subsidiaries (collectively “LyondellBasell N.V.,” the
    “Successor Company” or the “Successor”), is
    a worldwide manufacturer of chemicals and polymers, a refiner of
    crude oil, a significant producer of gasoline blending
    components and a developer and licensor of technologies for
    production of polymers. When we use the terms
    “LyondellBasell N.V.,” the “Successor
    Company,” the “Successor,” “we,”
    “us,” “our” or similar words, unless the
    context otherwise requires, we are referring to LyondellBasell
    N.V. after April 30, 2010. References herein to the
    “Company” for periods through April 30, 2010 are
    to the Predecessor Company, LyondellBasell AF, and for periods
    after the Emergence Date, to the Successor Company,
    LyondellBasell N.V.

LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A. was formed in the Grand
    Duchy of Luxembourg as a corporate partnership limited by shares
    in April 2005 by BI S.à.r.l., a Luxembourg private limited
    liability company, affiliated with Access Industries
    (“Access Industries”), which is a privately held
    industrial group based in the United States (“U.S.”).
    On July 2, 2009, Nell Limited (“Nell”), an
    affiliate of Access Industries and the indirect owner of 100% of
    the share capital of LyondellBasell AF, transferred its indirect
    ownership interest in LyondellBasell AF to Prochemie GmbH
    (“Prochemie”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ProChemie
    Holding Ltd. (“ProChemie Holding”). As of July 2,
    2009, Nell and ProChemie Holding each owned 50% of Prochemie,
    which owned 100% of the share capital of LyondellBasell AF.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

— The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the
    books and records of LyondellBasell N.V. and its majority-owned
    subsidiaries after April 30, 2010 and LyondellBasell AF and
    its majority-owned subsidiaries for periods up to and including
    that date under accounting principles generally accepted in the
    U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). All inter company
    transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
    (Continued)

The Company identified adjustments in its opening fresh start
    balance sheet as a result of deferred tax liabilities either
    omitted or included in error. These amounts in the aggregate
    were not material to the Predecessor period or the fresh start
    opening balance sheet. However, the Company has revised its
    consolidated financial statements for the four months ending
    April 30, 2010 to correct for an overstatement of goodwill
    and deferred income taxes with corresponding adjustments to
    Reorganization items and Benefit from income taxes resulting
    from these errors as follows:

Investments in joint ventures where we exert a certain level of
    management control, but lack full decision making ability over
    all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method.
    Under those circumstances, the equity method is used even though
    our ownership percentage may exceed 50%.

The Accounting Policies of LyondellBasell N.V. in the Successor
    period are as follows:

Fresh Start Accounting

— In accordance with
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 852,
    Reorganizations, (“ASC 852”), we applied
    “fresh-start” accounting as of May 1, 2010.
    Fresh-start accounting requires us to initially record the
    assets and liabilities at their fair value based on the
    Company’s reorganization value. Reorganization value is the
    fair value of the emerged entity before considering liabilities.
    The Debtors’ reorganization proceedings associated with
    their emergence from bankruptcy resulted in a new reporting
    entity. Financial information presented for the Successor is on
    a basis different from, and is therefore not comparable to,
    financial information for the Predecessor. The Predecessor
    information in the financial statements is for periods through
    April 30, 2010, including the impact of plan of
    reorganization provisions and the adoption of fresh-start
    accounting. For additional information on fresh-start
    accounting, see Note 4.



LYONDELLBASELL
    INDUSTRIES N.V.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
    (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

— Revenue from product
    sales is recognized at the time of transfer of title and risk of
    loss to the customer, which usually occurs at the time of
    shipment. Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery if we
    retain the risk of loss during shipment. For products that are
    shipped on a consignment basis, revenue is recognized when the
    customer uses the product. Costs incurred in shipping products
    sold are included in cost of sales. Billings to customers for
    shipping costs are included in sales revenue.

With respect to licensing contracts we recognize revenue on a

contract-by-contract

basis when we determine that we have sold our product or
    rendered service. For proven technologies for which we are
    contractually entitled to receive the vast majority of the
    contract value in cash at or before the date of customer
    acceptance, we will generally recognize revenue at the date of
    delivery of the process design package and the related license,
    provided that the undelivered items are considered
    inconsequential or perfunctory. Revenue for remaining
    perfunctory items for these contracts is recognized when the
    uncertainties are resolved. For contracts involving unproven
    process technology or post-delivery technical assistance that is
    not considered inconsequential or perfunctory, we recognize
    revenue at the date of customer acceptance up to the amount of
    fixed fees due at customer acceptance date. Future fixed fees
    for these contracts are recognized when the uncertainties are
    resolved. Royalties under these contracts are recognized when
    earned, typically based on production volumes.

Research and Development

— Research and
    Development (“R&D”) costs are expensed when
    incurred. Subsidies for research and development are included in
    Other income. Depreciation expense related to R&D assets is
    included as a cost of R&D. To the extent the purchase price
    in a business combination is allocated to in-process research
    and development assets, those assets are capitalized at fair
    value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When the
    related R&D project is abandoned, the assets are impaired
    and when the related R&D project activities are completed,
    we make a determination of the useful lives and amortize those
    assets over their useful lives.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Cash equivalents
    consist of highly liquid debt instruments such as certificates
    of deposit, commercial paper and money market accounts. Cash
    equivalents include instruments with maturities of three months
    or less when acquired. Cash equivalents are stated at cost,
    which approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents exclude
    restricted cash. Our cash equivalents are placed in high-quality
    commercial paper, money market funds and time deposits with
    major international banks and financial institutions.

We have no requirements for compensating balances in a specific
    amount at a specific point in time. We maintain compensating
    balances for some of our banking services and products. Such
    balances are maintained on an average basis and are solely at
    our discretion.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

— We establish
    provisions for doubtful accounts receivable based on our
    estimates of amounts that we believe are unlikely to be
    collected. Collectability of receivables is reviewed and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted at least quarterly,
    based on aging of specific accounts and other available
    information about the associated customers. Provisions for an
    allowance for doubtful accounts are included in selling, general
    and administrative expenses.

Inventories

— Inventories are carried at the
    lower of current market value or cost. Cost is determined using
    the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) method for raw materials, work in
    progress (“WIP”) and finished goods, and the moving
    average cost method for materials and supplies.

Inventory exchange transactions, which involve fungible
    commodities and do not involve the payment or receipt of cash,
    are not accounted for as purchases and sales. Any resulting
    volumetric exchange balances are accounted for as inventory,
    with cost determined using the LIFO method.



LYONDELLBASELL
    INDUSTRIES N.V.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
    (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant
    and equipment was recorded at fair value at emergence and then
    at cost subsequently. Depreciation is computed using the
    straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives,
    generally up to 25 years for major manufacturing equipment,
    30 years for buildings, 5 to 15 years for light
    equipment and instrumentation, 15 years for office
    furniture and 3 to 5 years for information system
    equipment. Upon retirement or sale, we remove the cost of the
    asset and the related accumulated depreciation from the accounts
    and reflect any resulting gain or loss in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Our policy is to capitalize interest cost
    incurred on debt during the construction of major projects
    exceeding one year.

Costs of major maintenance and repairs incurred as part of
    turnarounds of major units at our manufacturing facilities are
    deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over the
    period until the next planned turnaround, predominantly 4 to
    7 years. These costs are necessary to maintain, extend and
    improve the operating capacity and efficiency rates of the
    production units.

Long-Lived Asset Impairment

— We evaluate
    long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
    When it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not
    be sufficient to recover an asset’s carrying amount, the
    asset is written down to its estimated fair value.

Goodwill

— We recorded goodwill upon
    application of fresh-start accounting (see Note 4).
    Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually
    during the fourth quarter, or sooner if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying amount may exceed fair
    value. Recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated
    fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value, including
    the related goodwill, of that reporting unit. We use the present
    value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair
    value of the reporting units. The impairment test requires us to
    make cash flow assumptions including, among other things, future
    margins, volumes, operating costs, capital expenditures, growth
    rates and discount rates. Our assumptions regarding future
    margins and volumes require significant judgment as actual
    margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and will likely
    continue to do so.

Identifiable Intangible Assets

— Costs to
    purchase and to develop software for internal use are deferred
    and amortized over periods of 3 to 10 years. Other
    intangible assets were stated at fair value at emergence and
    carried at cost or amortized cost subsequently. Such assets
    primarily consist of emission allowances, various contracts, and
    in-process research and development. These assets are amortized
    using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
    or over the term of the related agreement, if shorter.

Environmental Remediation Costs

— Anticipated
    expenditures related to investigation and remediation of
    contaminated sites, which include current and former plant sites
    and other remediation sites, are accrued when it is probable a
    liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
    reasonably be estimated. Only ongoing operating and monitoring
    costs, the timing of which can be determined with reasonable
    certainty, are discounted to present value. Future legal costs
    associated with such matters, which generally are not estimable,
    are not included in these liabilities.

Legal Costs

— We expense legal costs, including
    those incurred in connection with loss contingencies, as
    incurred.

Income Taxes

— Deferred income taxes reflect
    the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
    carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
    reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes,
    as well as the net tax effects of net operating loss
    carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided against
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some
    portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.



LYONDELLBASELL
    INDUSTRIES N.V.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —
    (Continued)

We recognize the financial statement effects of an uncertain
    income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on
    the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon
    examination. We accrue for other tax contingencies when it is
    probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been
    incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably
    estimated.

Liabilities Subject to Compromise

— Pursuant to
    U.S. GAAP, certain pre-petition liabilities of the Debtors
    have been reclassified as of December 31, 2009, to
    long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets as liabilities subject to compromise (see Note 3).
    Liabilities subject to compromise included the Debtors’
    long-term debt that was considered undersecured and amounts that
    were due from the Debtors to vendors and employees for goods and
    services received prior to the January 6, 2009,
    April 24, 2009 and May 8, 2009 petition dates and
    include damage claims created by the Debtors’ rejection of
    executory contracts. The Debtors recognized claims at the
    probable allowed amounts. Claims for rejected contracts were
    recorded at the earlier of default by the Debtors under the
    contract or notification to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of
    rejection. Liabilities subject to compromise were distinguished
    from pre-petition liabilities of the Debtors estimated to be
    fully secured, post-petition liabilities of the Debtors and
    liabilities of the non-Debtors for all of which the balance
    sheet classification was unchanged.

Stock-Based Compensation

— The Company grants
    stock-based compensation awards that vest over a specified
    period or upon employees meeting certain service criteria. The
    fair value of equity instruments issued to employees is measured
    on the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period.

Non controlling interests

— Non-controlling
    interests primarily represent the interests of unaffiliated
    investors in a partnership that owns our PO/SM II plant at the
    Channelview, Texas complex and a subsidiary owning an equity
    investment in the Al-Waha Petrochemicals Ltd. joint venture.

    currency for the accompanying financial statements is the
    U.S. dollar. We have significant operations in several
    countries of which functional currencies are primarily the
    U.S. dollar for U.S. operations and the Euro for
    operations in Europe.

Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign
    functional currency financial statements are included in
    Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
    Stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
    and losses are included in current earnings.

Financial Instruments and Derivatives —

We
    selectively enter into derivative transactions to manage
    volatility related to market risks associated with changes in
    commodity pricing, currency exchange rates and interest rates.
    We categorize assets and liabilities, measured at fair value,
    into one of three different levels depending on the
    observability of the inputs employed in the measurement.
    Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are
    observable inputs other than quoted prices included within
    Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly through market corroborated inputs. Level 3
    inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
    reflecting significant modifications to observable related
    market data or our assumptions about pricing by market
    participants. For a discussion related to financial instruments
    and derivatives policies, see Note 17.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Classification

— Our consolidated financial
    statements classify precious metals and catalysts as components
    of Property, plant and equipment. Catalysts and precious metals
    were previously reported by the

Predecessor as Intangible assets and Other assets, respectively.
    Debt issuance costs, which were previously reported as
    Intangible assets, net, by the Predecessor, are classified as
    Other assets by the Successor.

The accounting policies of LyondellBasell A.F. in the
    Predecessor period were the same as for the Successor period
    except as follows:

Inventories

— Inventories are carried at the
    lower of current market value or cost. Cost is determined using
    the FIFO method, except for certain U.S. inventories for
    which cost is required to be determined using the LIFO method,
    and the average cost method for materials and supplies.

New
    Accounting Standards

Business Combinations

— In December 2010, the
    FASB issued guidance related to ASC Topic 805

, Business
    Combinations,

to clarify that if a public entity presents
    comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose
    pro-forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though
    the business combination(s) that occurred during the current
    year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior
    annual reporting period only. This guidance also expands the
    supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of
    the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma
    adjustments directly attributable to the business combination
    included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This
    guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
    the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
    December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of
    this amendment is not expected to have a material effect on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill

— In December 2010, the FASB issued
    guidance related to ASC Topic 350

, Intangibles —
    Goodwill and Other,

to require a company with reporting
    units having a carrying amount of zero or less to perform Step 2
    of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not
    that a goodwill impairment exists. This guidance is effective
    for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
    beginning December 15, 2010. Early adoption is not
    permitted. Adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a
    material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefits

— In
    September 2010, the FASB issued guidance related to ASC Topic

, Plan Accounting — Defined Contribution Pension
    Plans,

to clarify how loans to participants should be
    classified and measured by defined contribution pension benefit
    plans. The guidance requires that participant loans be
    classified as notes receivable from participants, which are
    segregated from plan investments and measured at their unpaid
    principal balance, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. This
    guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2010, and should be applied retrospectively to
    all prior periods presented. Early adoption is permitted.
    Adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material
    effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

— In April 2010, the FASB
    issued additional guidance on the criteria that should be met
    for determining whether the milestone method of revenue
    recognition is appropriate. Under this guidance, a vendor can
    recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a
    milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the
    milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria
    to be considered substantive. Our adoption of this amendment
    effective July 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on
    our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by its
    emerging issues task force to require companies to allocate
    revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on the estimated
    selling price of an element if vendor-specific or other
    third-party evidence of value is not available. The adoption of
    these changes, in January 2011, will not have a material effect
    on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

— In April 2010, the FASB issued
    additional guidance on accounting for certain tax effects of the
    2010 Health Care Reforms Act. The guidance requires entities to
    recognize the impact of changes in tax law in continuing
    operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the
    period that includes the enactment date. The adoption of these
    changes in March 2010 did not have a material effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement

— In January 2010, the
    FASB issued additional guidance on improving disclosures
    regarding fair value measurements. The guidance requires the
    disclosure of the amounts of, and the rationale for, significant
    transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair
    value hierarchy, as well as the rationale for transfers in or
    out of Level 3. We have adopted all of the amendments
    regarding fair value measurements except for a requirement to
    disclose information about purchases, sales, issuances, and
    settlements in the reconciliation of recurring Level 3
    measurements on a gross basis. The requirement to separately
    disclose purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of
    recurring Level 3 measurements beginning in 2011 will not
    have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Transfer and Servicing

— In June 2009, the FASB
    revised the requirements for accounting for transfers of
    financial assets. These revisions eliminate the concept of a
    “qualifying special-purpose entity,” change the
    requirements for de-recognizing financial assets, and require
    additional disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets,
    securitization transactions, and exposures to risks related to
    transferred financial assets. These changes were effective for
    the Company beginning in 2010. The adoption of these changes did
    not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Emergence
    from Chapter 11 Proceedings

On April 23, 2010, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court confirmed
    LyondellBasell AF’s Third Amended and Restated Plan of
    Reorganization and the Debtors emerged from chapter 11
    protection on April 30, 2010.

As a result of the emergence from chapter 11 proceedings,
    certain prepetition liabilities against the Debtors were
    discharged to the extent set forth in the Plan of Reorganization
    and otherwise applicable law and the Debtors were permitted to
    make distributions to their creditors in accordance with the
    terms of the Plan of Reorganization.

General unsecured non-priority claims against the Debtors were
    addressed through the bankruptcy process and were reported as
    liabilities subject to compromise and adjusted to the estimated
    allowed claim amount as determined through the bankruptcy
    process if determined to be probable and estimable. Certain of
    these claims were resolved and satisfied on or before the
    Debtors’ emergence on April 30, 2010. Except for
    certain specific non-priority claims, the unsecured non-priority
    claims were resolved as part of the Plan of Reorganization.

Under the Plan of Reorganization, the organizational structure
    of the Company in North America was simplified by the removal of
    90 legal entities. The ultimate ownership of 49 of these
    entities (identified as Schedule III Debtors in the Plan)
    was transferred to a new owner, the Millennium Custodial Trust,
    a trust established for the benefit of certain creditors, and
    these entities are no longer part of LyondellBasell N.V. In
    addition, certain real properties owned by the Debtors,
    including the Schedule III Debtors (as defined in the
    Plan), were transferred to the Environmental Custodial Trust,
    which now owns and is responsible for these properties. Any
    associated liabilities of the entities transferred to and owned
    by the Millennium Custodial Trust are the responsibility of
    those entities and claims regarding those entities will be
    resolved solely using their assets and the assets of the trust.
    In total, $250 million of cash was used to fund the two
    trusts, including approximately $80 million to the
    Millennium Custodial Trust and approximately $170 million
    to fund the Environmental Custodial Trust and to make certain
    direct payments to the U.S. EPA and certain state
    environmental agencies.

Emergence
    from Chapter 11 Proceedings —
    (Continued)

As part of the Debtors’ emergence from chapter 11
    proceedings, approximately 563.9 million shares of common
    stock of LyondellBasell N.V. were issued under the Plan,
    including 300 million shares of class A ordinary
    shares issued in exchange for allowed claims under the Plan of
    Reorganization. Approximately 263.9 million shares of
    LyondellBasell N.V. class B ordinary shares were issued in
    connection with a rights offering for gross proceeds of
    $2.8 billion.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, administrative and
    priority claims, as well as the new money

debtor-in-possession

(“DIP”) financing, were repaid in full. The lenders of
    certain DIP loans, which represented a

dollar-for-dollar

roll-up

or
    conversion of previously outstanding senior secured loans
    (“DIP

Roll-up

Notes”), received new senior secured third lien notes in
    the same principal amount as the DIP

Roll-up

Notes. In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, holders of
    senior secured claims received a combination of LyondellBasell
    N.V. class A ordinary shares; rights to purchase
    class B ordinary shares of LyondellBasell N.V.;
    LyondellBasell N.V. stock warrants; and cash. Allowed general
    unsecured claims received a combination of cash and class A
    ordinary shares of LyondellBasell N.V. pursuant to the Amended
    Lender Litigation Settlement approved by the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court on March 11, 2010.

In conjunction with the Debtors’ emergence from
    chapter 11, LyondellBasell N.V., through its wholly owned
    subsidiary, LBI Escrow Corporation, (“LBI Escrow”)
    issued $3.25 billion of first priority debt, including
    $2.25 billion and €375 million offerings of
    senior secured notes in a private placement and borrowings of
    $500 million under a senior term loan facility. Upon
    emergence, LBI Escrow merged with and into Lyondell Chemical
    Company (“Lyondell Chemical”), which replaced LBI
    Escrow as the issuer of the senior secured notes and as borrower
    under the term loan. On April 30, 2010, Lyondell Chemical
    issued $3,240 million of Senior Secured 11% Notes due
    2018 (the “Senior Secured 11% Notes”) in exchange
    for DIP

Roll-up

Notes incurred as part of the

debtor-in-possession

financing. The net proceeds from the sale of the senior secured
    notes, together with borrowings under the term loan, a new
    European securitization facility, and proceeds from the
    $2.8 billion rights offering, were used to repay and
    replace certain existing debt, including the

debtor-in-possession

credit facilities and an existing European securitization
    facility, and to make certain related payments. In addition, we
    entered into a new $1,750 million U.S. asset-based
    revolving credit facility, which can be used for advances or to
    issue up to $700 million of letters of credit. For
    additional information on the Company’s debt, see
    Note 15.

Liabilities Subject to Compromise

— Certain
    prepetition liabilities subject to compromise were reported at
    the expected allowed amount, even if they could potentially be
    settled for lesser amounts in accordance with the terms of the
    Plan of Reorganization. The total amount to be paid by the
    Debtors to settle claims is fixed under the Plan of
    Reorganization. As a result, all of the Debtors’
    liabilities subject to compromise at April 30, 2010 have
    been effectively resolved at the Emergence Date. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately $98 million of
    priority and administrative claims have yet to be paid.

The April 30, 2010 liabilities subject to compromise in the

    their discharge in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.

The Plan of Reorganization required that, upon emergence,
    certain liabilities previously reported as liabilities subject
    to compromise be retained by LyondellBasell N.V. Accordingly, on
    the Emergence Date, approximately $854 million of pension
    and other post-retirement benefit liabilities, included in
    employee benefits in the above table, were reclassified from
    liabilities subject to compromise to current or long-term
    liabilities, as appropriate.

Long-term debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise
    immediately prior to the Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy
    included amounts outstanding under the Interim Loan; the Senior
    Secured Credit Facility, including the Term Loan A
    U.S. Dollar tranche, the U.S. dollar and German
    tranches of Term Loan B and the Revolving Credit Facility;
    10.25% Debentures due 2010; 9.8% Debentures due 2020;
    7.55% Debentures due 2026; the Senior Notes due 2015;
    7.625% Senior Debentures due 2026; and loans from the State
    of Maryland and KIC Ltd.

All of the long-term debt classified in liabilities subject to
    compromise at April 30, 2010, except for a $6 million
    loan from KIC Ltd., was discharged pursuant to the Plan of
    Reorganization through distributions of a combination of
    LyondellBasell N.V. class A ordinary shares, the rights to
    purchase class B ordinary shares of LyondellBasell N.V. in
    a rights offering, warrants to purchase class A ordinary
    shares of LyondellBasell N.V. and cash. The loan from KIC Ltd.
    was transferred to the Millennium Custodial Trust under the Plan
    of Reorganization.

Reorganization Items

— Reorganization items,
    including professional advisory fees and other costs directly
    associated with our reorganization, recognized by the Debtors
    since the January 6, 2009 bankruptcy are classified as
    Reorganization items on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Post-emergence reorganization items are primarily related to
    professional fees associated with claim settlements, plan
    implementation and other transition costs attributable to the
    reorganization. Pre-emergence reorganization items include
    provisions and adjustments to record the carrying value of
    certain pre-petition liabilities at their estimated allowable
    claim amounts, as well as the costs incurred by non-Debtor
    companies as a result of the Debtors’ chapter 11
    proceedings.

Fresh-Start
    Accounting

Effective May 1, 2010, we adopted fresh-start accounting
    pursuant to ASC 852. Accordingly, the basis of the assets
    and liabilities in LyondellBasell AF’s financial statements
    for periods prior to May 1, 2010 will not be comparable to
    the basis of the assets and liabilities in the financial
    statements prepared for LyondellBasell N.V. after emergence from
    bankruptcy.

In order to qualify for fresh-start accounting, ASC 852
    requires that total post-petition liabilities and allowed claims
    be in excess of the reorganization value and that prepetition
    stockholders receive less than 50% of LyondellBasell N.V.’s
    common stock. Based on the estimated reorganization value and
    the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, the criteria of
    ASC 852 were met and, as a result, we applied fresh-start
    accounting on May 1, 2010.

In determining the range of reorganization values, we used a
    combination of customary valuation techniques, including, among
    other things:

•

The peer group trading analysis methodology, which calculates
    the total reorganization value of LyondellBasell N.V. by
    applying valuation metrics derived from an analysis of publicly
    traded peer companies to LyondellBasell N.V.’s estimated
    earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
    (“EBITDA”):

•

Valuation metrics consist of implied market trading multiples
    and are calculated by dividing the publicly traded peer
    company’s market capitalization by its respective EBITDA;

•

The peer group trading analysis was performed on both a
    consolidated and reported segment basis; and

Fresh-Start
    Accounting — (Continued)

•

Public peer companies were selected based on their comparability
    to LyondellBasell N.V.’s reportable operating segments,
    with those comparable companies primarily operating in the
    diversified commodity chemicals, refining and technology
    businesses.

•

Discounted cash flow valuation methodology, which calculates the
    reorganization value of LyondellBasell N.V. as the sum of the
    present value of its projected unlevered, after-tax free cash
    flows. The resulting reorganization valuation is representative
    of LyondellBasell N.V. on a cash-free, debt-free basis:

•

Financial projections beginning May 1, 2010 were estimated
    based on a

4-year

and

8-month

detailed forecast followed with a higher

level 10-year

forecast. These projections reflected certain economic and
    industry information relevant to the operating businesses of
    LyondellBasell N.V. and estimated cyclical trends where
    appropriate. Various time periods within the approximately

15-year

forecast period were evaluated including the entire period
    itself. To the extent that such cycles are, or commodity price
    volatility within any cycle is, greater or smaller than
    estimated, the estimate of the reorganization value could vary
    significantly;

•

The projected cash flows associated with the projections were
    discounted at a range of rates that reflected the estimated
    range of weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”);

•

The imputed discounted cash flow value comprises the sum of
    (i) the present value of the projected unlevered free cash
    flows over the projection period; and (ii) the present
    value of a terminal value, which represents the estimate of
    value attributable to performance beyond the projection period.
    Cash flows and associated imputed values were calculated on both
    a consolidated and reportable segment basis;

•

WACCs utilized in the consolidated discounted cash flow analysis
    ranged from 11% to 12%. The range of WACCs utilized were
    developed from an analysis of the yields associated with
    LyondellBasell N.V.’s own debt financings and the equity
    costs of peer companies as well as the anticipated mix of
    LyondellBasell N.V.’s debt and equity;

•

A range of terminal value EBITDA multiples were selected which,
    where appropriate, represented estimated industry cycle average
    market capitalization/EBITDA multiples; and

•

Additional discounted cash flow analysis was performed for
    LyondellBasell N.V.’s unconsolidated joint ventures.

In April 2010 the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the total
    reorganization enterprise value on a cash-free and debt-free
    basis for consolidated LyondellBasell AF at approximately
    $14.2 billion to $16.2 billion, with a midpoint of
    $15.2 billion. This estimate incorporated adjustments to
    include the estimated reorganization value of LyondellBasell
    AF’s interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, and
    deducted the estimated book value of third party non-controlling
    interests in consolidated joint ventures. The Plan of
    Reorganization, which was confirmed and approved by the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Court on April 23, 2010, without
    objection by any third party, adopted the midpoint of
    $15.2 billion as the reorganization value used to calculate
    and settle claims.

Fresh-start accounting requires us to allocate the
    reorganization value approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
    to the individual assets and liabilities based upon their
    estimated fair values. The determination of fair values of
    assets and liabilities is subject to significant estimation and
    assumptions. The following balance sheet information illustrates
    the financial effects as of May 1, 2010 of implementing the
    Plan of Reorganization and the adoption of fresh-start
    accounting. Adjustments recorded to the Predecessor balance
    sheet, resulting from the consummation of the Plan of
    Reorganization and the adoption of fresh-start accounting, are
    summarized below.

Fresh-Start
    Accounting

In applying fresh-start accounting at May 1, 2010, we
    recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from
    LyondellBasell AF at fair value, except for deferred income
    taxes and certain liabilities associated with employee benefits,
    which were recorded in accordance with ASC 852 and
    ASC 740, respectively. The significant assumptions related
    to the valuations of our assets and liabilities recorded in
    connection with fresh-start accounting are discussed herein. All
    valuation inputs, with the exception of the calculation of crude
    oil related raw material inventories, are considered to be
    Level 3 inputs, as they are based on significant inputs
    that are not observable in the market. Crude oil related raw
    material inventories were valued using a combination of
    Level 1 and Level 2 inputs depending on the
    availability of publicly available quoted market prices. For
    additional information on Level 1, Level 2 and
    Level 3 inputs, see Note 2.

h.

Inventory

— We recorded Inventory at
    its fair value of $4,849 million, which was determined as
    follows:

•

Finished goods were valued based on the estimated selling price
    of finished goods on hand less costs to sell, including disposal
    and holding period costs, and a reasonable profit margin on the
    selling and disposal effort for each specific category of
    finished goods being evaluated;

•

Work in process was valued based on the estimated selling price
    once completed less total costs to complete the manufacturing
    process, costs to sell including disposal and holding period
    costs, a reasonable profit margin on the remaining
    manufacturing, selling, and disposal effort; and

    INDUSTRIES N.V.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fresh-Start
    Accounting — (Continued)

•

Raw materials were valued based on current replacement cost.

Compared to amounts recorded by LyondellBasell AF, finished
    goods increased by $888 million, work in process increased
    by $65 million, raw materials increased by
    $313 million and other inventories increased by
    $31 million.

i.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— We
    recorded Property, plant and equipment, which includes land,
    buildings and equipment, furniture and fixtures and construction
    in progress, at its fair value. Fair value was based on the
    highest and best use of the assets. We considered and applied
    two approaches to determine fair value:

•

The market, sales comparison or trended cost approach was
    utilized for land, buildings and land improvements. This
    approach relies upon recent sales, offerings of similar assets
    or a specific inflationary adjustment to original purchase price
    to arrive at a probable selling price. Certain adjustments were
    made to reconcile differences in attributes between the
    comparable sales and the appraised assets.

•

The cost approach was utilized for certain assets primarily
    consisting of our machinery and equipment. This approach
    considers the amount required to construct or purchase a new
    asset of equal utility at current prices, with adjustments in
    value for physical deterioration, and functional and economic
    obsolescence. The machinery and equipment amounts determined
    under the cost approach were adjusted for functional
    obsolescence, which represents a loss in value due to
    unfavorable external conditions such as the facilities’
    locality, comparative inherent technology and comparative energy
    efficiency. Physical deterioration is an adjustment made in the
    cost approach to reflect the real operating age of any
    individual asset. LyondellBasell N.V.’s estimated economic
    obsolescence is the difference between the discounted cash flows
    (income approach) expected to be realized from utilization of
    the assets as a group, compared to the initial estimate of value
    from the cost approach method. In the analysis, the lower of the
    income approach and cost approach was used to determine the fair
    value of machinery and equipment in each reporting segment.
    Where the value per reportable segment, using the income
    approach, exceeded the value of machinery and equipment plus
    separately identifiable intangible assets, goodwill was
    generated.

The following table summarizes the components of Property, plant
    and equipment, net, at April 30, 2010, and reflects the
    application of fresh-start accounting at May 1, 2010:

Investments in Propylene Oxide (“PO”) Joint
    Ventures

— Investments in PO Joint Ventures were
    valued using the techniques described above to value Property,
    plant and equipment. The equity ownership reflects our direct
    proportional share of the property, plant and equipment of the
    PO Joint Ventures. The fair value of the Company’s equity
    interests in PO Joint Ventures is $452 million.

Equity Investments and Other Investments and
    Long-term Receivables

— Our equity in the net
    assets of our nonconsolidated affiliates was recorded at fair
    value of $1,575 million determined using discounted cash
    flow analyses, and included the following assumptions and
    estimates:

•

Forecasted cash flows, which incorporate projections of sales
    volumes, revenues, variable costs, fixed costs, other income and
    costs, and capital expenditures, after considering potential
    changes in unconsolidated affiliates portfolio and local market
    conditions;

•

A terminal value calculated for investments and long-term
    receivables with forecasted cash flows, not limited by
    contractual terms or the estimated life of the main investment
    asset, by assuming a maintainable level of after-tax debt-free
    cash flow multiplied by a capitalization factor reflecting the
    investor’s WACC adjusted for the estimated long-term
    perpetual growth rate; and

•

A discount rate ranging from 11% to 15% that considered various
    factors, including market and country risk premiums and tax
    rates to determine the investor’s WACC given the assumed
    capital structure of comparable companies.

The aggregate fair value of equity in net assets of
    nonconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method
    was $1,524 million.

l.

Goodwill

— We recorded Goodwill of
    $784 million, primarily resulting from the requirement to
    record the tax effect of the differences for the tax and book
    basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities. The reported
    goodwill and deferred tax liabilities reflect an adjustment of
    $314 million related to the overstatement of goodwill and
    deferred income taxes reported in previous quarterly financial
    statements (see Note 2). This correction has no cumulative
    impact on retained earnings.

m.

Intangible Assets

— We recorded
    Intangible assets at their fair values of $1,474 million.
    The following is a summary of the approaches used to determine
    the fair value of significant intangible assets:

•

We recorded the fair value of developed proprietary technology
    licensing and catalyst contracts of $210 million using an
    excess earnings methodology. Significant assumptions used in the
    calculation included:

•

Forecasted contractual income (fees generated) for each license
    technology category less directly attributable marketing as well
    as research and development costs;

•

Discount rates of 17% based on LyondellBasell N.V.’s WACC
    adjusted for perceived business risks related to the developed
    technologies; and

•

Economic lives estimated from 4 to 9 years.

•

We recorded the fair value of favorable utility contracts of
    $355 million using discounted cash flows. Significant
    assumptions used in this calculation included:

•

The forward price of natural gas;

•

The projected market settlement price of electricity;

•

Discount rates of 17% based on LyondellBasell N.V’s WACC
    adjusted for perceived business risks; and

•

Economic lives estimated from 11 to 16 years.

•

We recorded the fair value of $132 million for in-process
    research and development at the cost incurred to date adjusted
    for the probability of future marketability.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fresh-Start
    Accounting — (Continued)

•

We recorded the fair value of emission allowances of
    $731 million. Observed market activity for emission
    allowance trades is primarily generated only by legislation
    changes. As participants react to legislation, market trades
    occur as companies pursue their individual lowest cost
    compliance strategies. Trading, in the absence of an additional
    significant market participant, generally ceases once compliance
    is attained. As such, we could not identify any objective inputs
    based on market activity and an avoided cost of replacement
    methodology was used to determine estimated fair value. The
    significant assumptions used in valuing emission allowances
    include:

•

Business demand for utilization of the allowances held;

•

Engineering and construction costs required to reduce each
    marginal emission denomination; and

•

Development of new technologies to aid in the cost and
    effectiveness of compliance.

•

In addition we recorded other intangible assets, including
    capitalized software and software licenses, at its fair value of
    $46 million.

n.

Other Assets

— The adjustment primarily
    relates to the current deferred taxes and the change in the
    classification of precious metals from Other assets to Property,
    plant and equipment.

o.

Deferred Income Taxes, Current and
    Non-current

— The application of fresh-start
    accounting on May 1, 2010 resulted in the remeasurement of
    deferred income tax liabilities associated with the revaluation
    of the company’s assets and liabilities pursuant to
    ASC 852. Deferred income taxes were recorded at amounts
    determined in accordance with ASC 740.

p.

Other Liabilities

— The adjustment in
    accrued liabilities is primarily a result of the revaluation of
    deferred revenues based on discounted net cash outflows.

q.

Retained Deficit

— The changes to
    retained deficit reflect our revaluation of the assets and
    liabilities of $5,598 million recorded in Reorganization
    items in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of
    $2,092 million related tax adjustments.

r.

Non-controlling Interests

— We recorded
    the fair value of non-controlling interests which resulted in a
    decrease of $58 million.

5.

Business
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

In December 2010 LyondellBasell N.V. completed the sale of
    LyondellBasell Flavors & Fragrances, LLC (the
    “Flavor & Fragrance chemicals business”),
    receiving proceeds of $154 million and recognized an
    after-tax gain of $64 million. The Flavor &
    Fragrance chemicals business has manufacturing facilities at
    Jacksonville, Florida, and Brunswick, Georgia, and approximately
    200 employees. It produces terpene-based fragrance
    ingredients and flavor ingredients for the oral-care,
    confectionery and beverage market.

The capital gain generated by the sale of the Flavor &
    Fragrance chemicals business was offset by capital loss and
    carryforwards, for which a full valuation allowance had been
    recorded and, as such, no tax was provided.

In September 2008, the Predecessor completed the sale of its
    toluene diisocyanate (“TDI”) business for net proceeds
    of €77 million ($113 million). The income related
    to the sale of the Flavor & Fragrance chemicals
    business and the TDI business has been classified as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    income. The combined revenues and operating expenses of these
    businesses are not material.

Acquisition of Shell Oil Refinery in Berre l’Etang,
    France

— In April 2008, LyondellBasell AF acquired
    the Shell oil refinery, inventory and associated infrastructure
    and businesses at the Berre l’Etang petrochemical complex
    in France (the “Berre Refinery”) for a purchase price
    of $927 million including a final adjustment for

working capital and $112 million for settlement of an
    accrued contingent consideration. The contingent consideration
    resulted from the 2005 acquisition of the remaining 50% of
    Société du Craqueur de l’Aubette S.A.S.
    (“SCA”) from its previous joint venture partner Shell
    Pétrochimie Méditerranée.

The refinery is a source of raw materials for, and allowed for
    vertical integration at, one of our core integrated European
    sites, which operates world-scale polypropylene and polyethylene
    plants, a steam cracker and a butadiene extraction unit at Berre
    l’Etang and a polyethylene plant at nearby Fos sur Mer. The
    acquisition also allows optimization opportunities with our
    global fuels and chemicals businesses and provides us with
    access to significant local logistics assets, including pipeline
    access, storage terminals and harbor access to the Mediterranean
    Sea. The refinery’s products include naphtha, VGO,
    liquefied petroleum gas, fuels for a variety of applications,
    heating oil and bitumen.

Consolidation of the refinery’s operations prospectively
    from April 1, 2008 added revenues of $2,750 million
    and a $147 million operating loss, excluding the impairment
    discussed below, to the 2008 results of operations.

In the fourth quarter 2008, LyondellBasell AF evaluated the
    long-lived assets of the Berre Refinery for impairment and
    recorded a $218 million charge representing the net book
    value of the assets acquired in April 2008.

Acquisition of Solvay Engineered Polymers

— In
    February 2008, LyondellBasell AF acquired Solvay Engineered
    Polymers, Inc. (“Solvay”), a leading supplier of
    polypropylene compounds in North America for $134 million.
    The acquisition of Solvay complements our existing polymer-based
    composite materials and alloys business in North America.

6.

Insurance
    Claims

LyondellBasell AF received insurance proceeds during 2009 and
    2008 of $120 million and $89 million, respectively,
    representing partial settlements of outstanding insurance claims
    related to damages sustained in 2005 at the polymers plant in
    Münchsmünster, Germany. These proceeds were used to
    finance the construction of the polyethylene plant in
    Münchsmünster, Germany (see Note 21).
    LyondellBasell AF recognized gains on involuntary conversion in
    2009 and 2008 of $120 million and $79 million,
    respectively, all of which were included in “Other income,
    net,” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Related
    Party Transactions

The Company has related party transactions with affiliates of
    our major shareholders, Access Industries (“Access”)
    and Apollo Management (“Apollo”), and with the
    Company’s joint venture partners (see Note 13).

Access

— Past Access related party transactions
    included a management and a tax-sharing agreement.

Upon emergence, in May 2010, we entered into a tax cooperation
    agreement with Access. The tax cooperation agreement allows
    either party to provide the other with information and support
    in connection with tax return preparation and audits for a fee.
    There were no payments made or received under this agreement
    during 2010.

In December 2007, LyondellBasell AF also entered into a
    tax-sharing agreement with a subsidiary of Access entitling
    Access to consideration equal to 17.5% of the net operating loss
    carryforwards used by LyondellBasell AF entities to reduce their
    Dutch or French income tax liability. Payments under this
    agreement are limited to a maximum of $175 million. There
    were no payments under this agreement during 2010, 2009 and
    2008. This agreement was not assumed upon the Company’s
    emergence from chapter 11.

In December 2007, in connection with the Lyondell Chemical
    acquisition, LyondellBasell AF entered into a management
    agreement with Access. The agreement included a periodic annual
    fee of $25 million.

    agreement was not assumed upon the Company’s emergence from
    chapter 11.

On December 20, 2010, one of our subsidiaries received
    demand letters from affiliates of Access. The Access affiliates
    have demanded that our subsidiary, LyondellBasell Industries
    Holdings B.V. (“LBIH”), indemnify them and their
    shareholders, members, affiliates, officers, directors,
    employees and other related parties for all losses, including
    attorney’s fees and expenses, arising out of a pending
    lawsuit and pay $50 million in management fees for 2009 and
    2010 in addition to other unspecified amounts related to advice
    purportedly given in connection with financing and other
    strategic transactions. For additional information related to
    this matter, see Note 21.

Apollo —

As a result of the distribution of
    ordinary shares of LyondellBasell N.V. common stock pursuant to
    the Plan of Reorganization and the issuance of ordinary shares
    of LyondellBasell N.V. common stock under a rights offering on
    the Emergence Date, we began reporting transactions between the
    Company and entities in which Apollo and its affiliates own
    interests as related party transactions. These transactions
    include the sales of product under a long-term contract that
    renews automatically each year on July 31, unless a
    90 day notice of termination has been received. Other
    product sales are made on the spot market.

Consultant Fee

— In connection with the
    Bankruptcy cases, LyondellBasell AF retained the services of and
    entered into a Bankruptcy Court-approved contractual agreement
    with one of its directors. The director received a
    $10 million success fee from the Company upon emergence
    from chapter 11.

Joint Venture Partners —

The Company has
    related party transactions with its equity investees. These
    related party transactions include the sales and purchases of
    goods in the normal course of business as well as certain
    financing arrangements. In addition, under contractual
    arrangements with certain of the Company’s equity
    investees, we receive certain services, utilities, materials and
    facilities at some of our manufacturing sites and we provide
    certain services to our equity investees.

In December 2009, LyondellBasell N.V. advanced
    €10 million ($14 million) to its joint venture
    partner, Basell Orlen Polyolefins SP.Z.O.O. under a loan
    agreement that matures on December 31, 2013. The note bears

Short-term
    Investments

As a result of financial difficulties experienced by major
    financial institutions beginning in the latter part of the third
    quarter of 2008, LyondellBasell AF received notice that rights
    of redemption had been suspended with respect to a money market
    fund in which LyondellBasell AF invested approximately
    $174 million. LyondellBasell AF had been advised that
    additional redemptions were forthcoming, subject to
    LyondellBasell AF’s pro rata share of a $3.5 billion
    loss reserve established by the fund in February 2009.
    Accordingly, LyondellBasell AF recorded a provision in 2008 for
    an estimated loss of $5 million related to the money market
    fund. However, on May 5, 2009, the SEC filed an application
    for injunctive and other relief with The United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York
    (“U.S. District Court”) that objected to the
    creation of the $3.5 billion loss reserve and instead
    proposed a plan to distribute the remaining assets of the money
    market fund on a pro rata basis to shareholders that have not
    been fully redeemed since September 15, 2008. A majority of
    the claimants agreed with the SEC’s plan and on
    November 25, 2009, the U.S. District Court issued an
    order which provided for a pro rata distribution of the
    remaining assets. The Company received redemptions totaling
    $172 million through December 31, 2010, including
    $12 million in 2010, $23 million in 2009 and
    $137 million in 2008. The 2010 redemption exceeded the
    $9 million carrying value. Accordingly, the Predecessor
    recognized a $3 million gain on redemption in January 2010.

Accounts
    Receivable

We sell our products primarily to other industrial concerns in
    the petrochemicals and refining industries. We perform ongoing
    credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition
    and, in certain circumstances, require letters of credit or
    corporate guarantees from them. As part of fresh-start
    accounting our Accounts receivable were valued at market. Our
    allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010, which
    is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a reduction
    of accounts receivable, was $12 million. LyondellBasell
    AF’s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable totaled
    $109 million at December 31, 2009.

3,277

In connection with application of fresh-start accounting on
    May 1, 2010, we recorded inventory at its fair value of
    $4,849 million (see Note 4). The increase in inventory
    of $1,297 million was primarily in the U.S. and
    largely due to the price of crude oil.

We recorded non-cash charges in the Successor period totaling
    $365 million to adjust the value of our raw materials and
    finished goods inventory to market as of June 30, 2010 and
    September 30, 2010. These non-cash charges were the result
    of the decline in the per barrel benchmark price of crude oil
    from the Emergence Date to June 30, 2010 and lower market
    prices for certain products, primarily polypropylene. A non-cash
    credit of $323 million recorded in the fourth quarter 2010
    to reflect the recovery of market price substantially offset the
    lower of cost or market adjustment related to our raw materials
    inventory.

LyondellBasell AF recorded charges of $127 million and
    $1,256 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, to adjust
    the value of its inventory to market value, which was lower than
    the carrying cost at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

At December 31, 2010, approximately 87% of our inventories
    were valued using the LIFO method. Approximately 42% of the
    Predecessor inventory was valued using the LIFO method at
    December 31, 2009, and the remainder, excluding materials
    and supplies, was valued using the FIFO method. The excess of
    current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted
    to $257 million and $801 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2010 and 2009, liquidations
    of LIFO inventory layers resulted in charges of $9 million
    and $5 million, respectively.

In connection with application of fresh-start accounting on
    May 1, 2010, we recorded Property, plant and equipment,
    which includes land, buildings and equipment, furniture and
    fixtures and construction in progress, at its fair value of
    $7,080 million (see Note 4).

On February 25, 2010, based on the continued impact of
    global economic conditions on polypropylene demand,
    LyondellBasell AF announced a project to cease production at,
    and permanently shut down, its polypropylene plant at Terni,
    Italy. LyondellBasell AF recognized charges of $23 million
    in cost of sales related to plant and other closure costs in the
    first quarter of 2010. In July 2010 the plant ceased production.

Following an analysis of the cash flow projections for the Berre
    refinery, we concluded that the capital additions in 2010 are
    impaired. Accordingly, we recognized a $25 million charge
    for impairment of the carrying value of those assets.

The full carrying value of the Berre Refinery assets was
    impaired in 2008 resulting in a charge of $218 million. The
    analysis that was conducted resulting in the impairment was
    triggered by a downward revision of the Company’s long
    range cash flow projections due to the significantly
    deteriorating business conditions experienced in the fourth
    quarter of 2008.

Capitalized interest expense related to Property, plant and
    equipment for the eight months ended December 31, 2010, the
    four months ended April 30, 2010 and for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $2 million,
    $4 million, $35 million and $13 million,
    respectively.

Goodwill

— We recorded goodwill of
    $784 million upon application of fresh-start accounting
    (see Note 4). Goodwill at December 31, 2010 reflects a
    $3 million effect of changes in currency exchange rates
    since April 30, 2010. This was the only movement in
    goodwill during the Successor period.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, LyondellBasell AF determined
    that the goodwill associated with its Refining and Oxyfuels,
    O&P — Americas and Intermediates and Derivatives
    business segments was impaired. The impairment was based on a
    review of the business segments performed by Management in which
    discounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of the
    goodwill due to the rapid deterioration in the global economy
    and the effects on LyondellBasell AF’s operations in the
    latter part of the fourth quarter of 2008. Accordingly, in the
    fourth quarter of 2008, LyondellBasell AF recorded a charge to
    earnings of $4,982 million, for impairment of goodwill,
    including $4,921 million related to the December 20,
    2007 acquisition of Lyondell Chemical. In the fourth quarter of
    2009, LyondellBasell AF recorded an adjustment related to prior
    periods which increased income from operations and net income
    for the three-month period

ended December 31, 2009 by $65 million. The adjustment
    related to an overstatement of goodwill impairment in 2008.

Intangible Assets

— In connection with
    application of fresh-start accounting on May 1, 2010, we
    recorded Intangible assets at their fair values of

During the Successor period we recognized an impairment of
    $3 million related to certain in-process research and
    development projects which were abandoned.

During the fourth quarter 2009 LyondellBasell AF recognized a
    $44 million charge related to surplus highly-reactive
    volatile organic compound (“HRVOC”) emissions
    allowances. For purposes of the annual impairment test, fair
    value was measured based on estimates of cost to implement
    alternative emission reduction technology. Also in December
    2009, LyondellBasell AF recognized a $9 million impairment
    for

non-U.S. emission

rights. These charges are reflected in Impairments on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

In connection with application of fresh-start accounting on
    May 1, 2010, we recorded asset retirement obligations at
    their fair values of $138 million.

We believe that there are asset retirement obligations
    associated with some of our facilities, but that the present
    value of those obligations is not material in the context of an
    indefinite expected life of the facilities. We continually
    review the optimal future alternatives for our facilities. Any
    decision to retire one or more facilities may result in an
    increase in the present value of such obligations.

Investment
    in PO Joint Ventures

We, together with Bayer AG and Bayer Corporation (collectively
    “Bayer”), share ownership in a U.S. propylene
    oxide (“PO”) manufacturing joint venture (the
    “U.S. PO Joint Venture”) and a separate joint
    venture for certain related PO technology. Bayer’s
    ownership interest represents ownership of annual in-kind PO
    production of the U.S. PO Joint Venture of 1.5 billion
    pounds in 2010 and 2009. We take in kind the remaining PO
    production and all co-product (styrene monomer (“SM”
    or “styrene”) and tertiary butyl ether
    (“TBA”) production from the U.S. PO Joint Venture.

In addition, we and Bayer each have a 50% interest in a separate
    manufacturing joint venture (the “European PO Joint
    Venture”), which includes a world-scale PO/SM plant at
    Maasvlakte near Rotterdam, The Netherlands. We and Bayer each
    are entitled to 50% of the PO and SM production at the European
    PO Joint Venture.

We and Bayer do not share marketing or product sales under the
    U.S. PO Joint Venture. We operate the U.S. PO Joint
    Venture’s and the European PO Joint Venture’s
    (collectively the “PO joint ventures”) plants and
    arrange and coordinate the logistics of product delivery. The
    partners share in the cost of production and logistics based on
    their product offtake.

We report the cost of our product offtake as inventory and cost
    of sales in our consolidated financial statements. Related cash
    flows are reported in the operating cash flow section of the
    consolidated statements of cash flows. Our investment in the PO
    joint ventures is reduced through recognition of our share of
    the depreciation and amortization of the assets of the PO joint
    ventures, which is included in cost of sales. Other changes in
    the investment balance are principally due to additional capital
    investments in the PO joint ventures

In connection with application of fresh-start accounting on
    May 1, 2010, we recorded equity investments at their fair
    value of $1,524 million (see Note 4). The carrying
    value of our equity investments at December 31, 2010 of
    $1,587 million reflects the 2010 aggregate fair value
    adjustment, which is different than our share of its equity
    investment in the underlying assets of $1,225 million. In
    2009, the Company recognized pretax impairment charges totaling
    $228 million for impairment of the carrying value of its
    investments in certain joint ventures.

A joint venture of ours is in default under its financing
    arrangement due to a delay in the

start-up

of
    its assets and as a result of LyondellBasell AF’s voluntary
    filing for relief under chapter 11 of the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 24, 2009. The parties
    are currently negotiating in good faith to resolve the default
    and at present there is no evidence that such negotiations will
    not be concluded successfully or that the resolution of this
    matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or

On April 30, 2010, in accordance with provisions in the
    Plan of Reorganization, payments totaling $2,362 million
    were made to repay, in full, $2,167 million outstanding
    under the DIP Term Loan Facility and a related $195 million
    exit fee. The outstanding amount of $985 million under the
    DIP ABL Facility was also repaid on April 30, 2010. In
    addition, $18,310 million of debt classified as liabilities
    subject to compromise was discharged pursuant to the Plan of
    Reorganization (see Note 4).

Senior Secured 8% Notes

— On April 8,
    2010, LBI Escrow issued $2,250 million of 8% senior
    secured notes due 2017 and €375 million of senior
    secured notes due 2017, (collectively, the “Senior Secured
    8% Notes”). We paid fees of $62 million related
    to the issuance of these facilities. On April 30, 2010,
    Lyondell Chemical was merged with and replaced LBI Escrow as
    issuer of the Senior Secured 8% Notes and borrower under
    the Senior Term Loan Facility.

The Senior Secured 8% Notes are jointly and severally, and
    fully and unconditionally guaranteed by LyondellBasell N.V. and,
    subject to certain exceptions, each existing and future wholly
    owned U.S. restricted subsidiary of LyondellBasell N.V.
    (other than Lyondell Chemical, as issuer), other than any such
    subsidiary that is a subsidiary of a

non-U.S. subsidiary

(the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with
    LyondellBasell N.V., the “Guarantors”).



LYONDELLBASELL
    INDUSTRIES N.V.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Debt —
    (Continued)

The Senior Secured 8% Notes rank equally in right of
    payment with all existing and future senior debt of Lyondell
    Chemical and the Guarantors; the notes and guarantees rank
    junior to obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee
    the Senior Secured 8% Notes.

The Senior Secured 8% Notes and guarantees are secured by:

•

a first priority lien on substantially all of Lyondell
    Chemical’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and
    future property and assets other than the assets securing the
    U.S. ABL Facility;

•

a first priority lien on the capital stock of Lyondell Chemical
    and all Subsidiary Guarantors (other than any such subsidiary
    that is a subsidiary of a

non-U.S. subsidiary);

•

a first priority lien on 65% of the capital stock and 100% of
    the non-voting capital stock of the first-tier

non-U.S. subsidiaries

of Lyondell Chemical or of LyondellBasell N.V.;

•

a second priority lien on the accounts receivables, inventory,
    related contracts and other rights and assets related to the
    foregoing and proceeds thereof that secure the U.S. ABL
    Facility on a first priority basis;

•

subject, in each case, to certain exceptions permitted liens and
    releases under certain circumstances.

The Senior Secured 8% Notes are redeemable by Lyondell
    Chemical (i) prior to maturity at specified redemption
    premium percentages according to the date the notes are redeemed
    or (ii) from time to time at a redemption price of 100% of
    such principal amount plus generally applicable premium as
    calculated pursuant to a formula.

In addition, Lyondell Chemical has the option to redeem up to
    10% of the outstanding Senior Secured 8% Notes annually
    prior to May 1, 2013 at a redemption price equal to 103% of
    such notes’ principal amount. Also prior to May 1,
    2013, Lyondell Chemical has the option to redeem up to 35% of
    the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured
    8% Notes (plus any additional notes), generally at a
    redemption price of 108% of such principal amount, with the net
    proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that
    (i) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount
    remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and
    (ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the
    closing of the equity offering. The value of this embedded
    derivative is nominal.

The Senior Secured 8% Notes are redeemable at par after
    May 1, 2016 and contain covenants, subject to certain
    exceptions, that restrict, among other things, debt and lien
    incurrence; investments; certain restricted payments; sales of
    assets and mergers; and affiliate transactions.

Several of the restrictive covenants would be suspended if we
    receive an investment grade rating from two rating agencies. The
    Senior Secured 8% Notes are not subject to the maintenance
    of any specific financial covenant.

In December 2010 we redeemed $225 million of
    8.0% Senior Secured dollar notes and
    €37.5 million ($50 million) of 8.0% Senior
    Secured Euro notes maturing in 2017, pursuant to the terms of
    the indenture representing repayment of 10% of the outstanding
    bonds. Interest expense in the 2010 Successor period reflects
    the effect of prepayment premiums of $7 million and
    $1 million, respectively, paid in connection with the
    repayment of the 8% Senior Secured dollar notes and
    8% Senior Secured Euro notes.

Senior Secured 11% Notes

— Consistent with
    the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, on the Emergence Date,
    Lyondell Chemical issued Senior Secured 11% Notes under an
    indenture of approximately $3,240 million, replacing the
    DIP

Roll-up

Notes issued as part of the DIP Term Loan Facility in January
    2009.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Debt —
    (Continued)

The Senior Secured 11% Notes are guaranteed by the same
    Guarantors that support the Senior Secured 8% Notes, the
    Senior Term Loan Facility and the U.S. ABL Facility. The
    Senior Secured 11% Notes are secured by the same security
    package as the Senior Secured 8% Notes, the Senior Term
    Loan Facility and the U.S. ABL Facility on a third priority
    basis and bear interest at a rate equal to 11%.

The Senior Secured 11% Notes are redeemable by Lyondell
    Chemical (i) at par on or after May 1, 2013 and
    (ii) from time to time at a redemption price of 100% of
    such principal amount plus generally applicable premium as
    calculated pursuant to a formula.

In addition, Lyondell Chemical has the option to redeem up to
    35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior
    Secured 11% Notes (plus any additional notes), generally at
    a redemption price of 111% of such principal amount, with the
    net proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that
    (i) at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount
    remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and
    (ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the
    closing of the equity offering. The value of this embedded
    derivative is nominal. The exercise of this option is subject to
    certain limitations under the Senior Term Loan Facility.

Registration Rights Agreement —

In connection
    with the issuance of the Senior Secured 8% Notes and the
    Senior Secured 11% Notes (collectively, the “Senior
    Secured Notes”), we entered into registration rights
    agreements that require us to exchange the Senior Secured Notes
    for notes with substantially identical terms as the Senior
    Secured Notes except the new notes will be registered with the
    SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will
    therefore be free of any transfer restrictions. The registration
    rights agreement requires a registration statement for the
    exchange to be effective with the SEC by April 30, 2011 and
    the exchange to be consummated within 45 days thereafter.
    If we do not meet these deadlines, the interest rate on the
    Senior Secured Notes will be increased by 0.25% per annum for
    the

90-day

period following April 30, 2011 and will increase by an
    additional 0.25% for each subsequent

90-day

period that the registration and exchange are not completed, up
    to a maximum of 1.00% per annum.

Senior Term Loan Facility

— On April 8,
    2010, LBI Escrow borrowed $500 million under a new
    six-year, $500 million senior term loan facility (the
    “Senior Term Loan Facility”) and received proceeds,
    net of discount, of $495 million. We paid fees of
    $10 million related to the issuance of this facility.

Borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility will bear
    interest at either (a) a LIBOR rate adjusted for certain
    additional costs or (b) a base rate determined by reference
    to the highest of the administrative agent’s prime rate,
    the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or one-month LIBOR
    plus 1.0% (the “Base Rate”), in each case plus an
    applicable margin.

The Senior Term Loan Facility is guaranteed, jointly and
    severally, and fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured
    basis, initially by the Guarantors. Subject to permitted liens
    and other exceptions, Lyondell Chemical’s obligations and
    guarantees will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior
    Secured Notes by first priority security interests in the
    collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and by a second
    priority security interest in the collateral securing the
    U.S. ABL Facility described below.

The Senior Term Loan Facility contains covenants that are
    substantially similar to the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
    Term Loan Facility is not subject to the maintenance of any
    specific financial covenant.

During the Successor period, we made payments under the Senior
    Term Loan Facility totaling $495 million, including a
    $1 million mandatory quarterly amortization payment in
    September 2010 and $494 million in December 2010. The
    payment in December 2010 satisfied all future amortization
    payments under the loan.

U.S. ABL Facility

— On April 8, 2010,
    Lyondell Chemical completed the financing of a new four-year,
    $1,750 million U.S. asset-based facility
    (“U.S. ABL Facility”), which may be used for
    advances or to issue up to $700 million of letters of
    credit. Lyondell Chemical paid fees of $70 million related
    to the completion of



LYONDELLBASELL
    INDUSTRIES N.V.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

this financing. Borrowings under the U.S. ABL Facility bear
    interest at the Base Rate or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin,
    and the lenders are paid a commitment fee on the average daily
    unused commitments.

At December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding
    under the U.S. ABL facility and outstanding letters of
    credit totaled $370 million. Pursuant to the U.S. ABL
    facility, Lyondell Chemical could, subject to a borrowing base,
    borrow up to $1,380 million. The borrowing base is
    determined using formulae applied to accounts receivable and
    inventory balances, and is reduced to the extent of outstanding
    letters of credit under the facility. Advances under this new
    facility are available to our subsidiaries, Lyondell Chemical,
    Equistar Chemicals LP (“Equistar”), Houston Refining
    LP, or LyondellBasell Acetyls LLC.

Obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility are guaranteed
    jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, on a
    senior secured basis, by the Guarantors (except, in the case of
    any Guarantor that is a borrower under the facility, to the
    extent of its own obligations in its capacity as a borrower).
    The borrowers’ obligations under the U.S. ABL Facility
    and the related guarantees are secured by (i) a first
    priority lien on all present and after-acquired inventory,
    accounts receivable, related contracts and other rights, deposit
    accounts into which proceeds of the foregoing are credited, and
    books and records related thereto, together with all proceeds of
    the foregoing, in each case to the extent of the rights, title
    and interest therein of any ABL borrowers and (ii) a second
    priority lien on the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Term Loan
    Facility collateral.

Mandatory prepayments of the loans under the U.S. ABL
    Facility will be made from net cash proceeds from certain sales
    of collateral securing the facility and insurance and
    condemnation awards involving the facility.

The U.S. ABL Facility contains covenants that are
    substantially similar to the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, during the first two years, in the event
    (i) excess availability under the U.S. ABL Facility
    falls below $300 million for five consecutive business days
    or below $250 million on any business day, or
    (ii) total liquidity falls below $550 million for five
    consecutive business days or below $500 million on any
    business day, we are required to comply with a minimum fixed
    charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, measured
    quarterly. Following the second anniversary of the effective
    date, in the event (i) excess availability under the
    U.S. ABL Facility falls below $400 million for five
    consecutive business days or below $325 million on any
    business day, or (ii) total liquidity falls below
    $650 million for five consecutive business days or below
    $575 million on any business day, we are also required to
    meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The fixed charge
    coverage ratio is defined in the facility, generally, as the
    ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
    amortization less capital expenditures to consolidated interest
    expense, plus dividends on preferred or other preferential
    stock, adjusted for relevant taxes, and scheduled repayments of
    debt. The availability under the U.S. ABL Facility was
    $1,380 million as of December 31, 2010.

Guaranteed Notes due 2027

— We have outstanding
    fixed interest rate Guaranteed Notes of $300 million with a
    maturity date of March 15, 2027. The interest rate is 8.1%
    and the interest payment dates are September 15 and
    March 15.

The Guaranteed Notes are guaranteed by LyondellBasell Industries
    Holdings B.V., a subsidiary of LyondellBasell N.V. The 2027
    Guaranteed Notes provide certain restrictions with respect to
    the level of maximum debt that can be incurred and security that
    can be granted by the operating companies in Italy and The
    Netherlands that are direct or indirect wholly owned
    subsidiaries of LyondellBasell Industries Holdings B.V.

The 2027 Notes contain customary provisions for default,
    including, among others, the non-payment of principal and
    interest on the 2027 Notes, certain failures to perform or
    observe any other obligation under the 2027 Agreement on the
    2027 Notes, the occurrence of certain defaults under other
    indebtedness, failure to pay certain indebtedness and the
    insolvency or bankruptcy of certain LyondellBasell N.V.
    subsidiaries.

Receivables securitization programs

— On
    December 20, 2007, in connection with the acquisition of
    Lyondell Chemical, certain U.S. subsidiaries entered into a
    $1,150 million accounts receivable securitization facility
    to sell, through a wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary,
    on an ongoing basis and without recourse, interests in a pool of
    U.S. accounts receivable to financial institutions
    participating in the facility.

The amount of outstanding receivables sold under the new
    facility was $503 million as of December 31, 2008. On
    January 9, 2009, as a result of the filing for relief under
    chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the
    $1,150 million accounts receivable sales facility was
    terminated and repaid in full, using $503 million of the
    initial proceeds of the DIP Financing.

The Company had an accounts receivable securitization program
    under which it could receive funding of up to
    €450 million against eligible receivables of certain
    European subsidiaries. This facility was refinanced, in full, on
    May 4, 2010 and replaced with a new three-year European
    securitization facility. Transfers of accounts receivable under
    this program do not qualify as sales; therefore, the transferred
    accounts receivable and the proceeds received through such
    transfers are included in Trade receivables, net, and Short-term
    debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In October 2010, the
    amounts outstanding under the receivable securitization program
    were repaid. The lenders will receive a commitment fee on the
    unused commitments.

Accounts Receivable Factoring Facility

— On
    October 8, 2009, the Company entered into an accounts
    receivable factoring facility for up to €100 million.
    The factoring facility was for an indefinite period,
    non-recourse, unsecured and terminable by either party subject
    to notice. In November 2010, the facility was paid in full and
    terminated.

Other

— In the eight months ended
    December 31, 2010, and in the four months ended
    April 30, 2010, amortization of debt premiums and debt
    issuance costs resulted in amortization expense of
    $23 million and $307 million, respectively, that was
    included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of
    Income. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    such amortization was $499 million and $513 million,
    respectively, including adjustments to fair values included in
    accounting for the acquisition of Lyondell Chemical, and debt
    issuance costs.

In 2009, in conjunction with the reclassification of debt to
    “Liabilities Subject to Compromise,” LyondellBasell AF
    wrote off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs of
    $228 million, which are reflected in “Reorganization
    items” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Contractual interest for the Debtors was $914 million for
    the four-months ended April 30, 2010; and
    $2,720 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Our 2010 weighted average interest rate on outstanding
    short-term debt was 5% and 9.2% in the 2010 Successor and
    Predecessor periods, respectively, and 8.8% in 2009.

Lease
    Commitments

We lease office facilities, railcars, vehicles, and other

    renewal provisions, purchase options and escalation clauses.
    Additionally, we have entered into a long-term agreement with an
    information technology service provider that is cancellable by
    us with a six-month notice period and payment of a cancellation
    fee. This agreement is classified as an operating lease.

Financial
    Instruments and Derivatives

Cash Concentration

— Our cash equivalents are
    placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds and
    time deposits with major international banks and financial
    institutions.

Market Risks

— We are exposed to market risks,
    such as changes in commodity pricing, currency exchange rates
    and interest rates. To manage the volatility related to these
    exposures, we selectively enter into derivative transactions
    pursuant to our policies. Designation of the derivatives as
    fair-value or cash-flow hedges is performed on a specific
    exposure basis. Hedge accounting may or may not be elected with
    respect to certain short-term exposures. The changes in fair
    value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in
    whole by corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows
    of the underlying exposures being hedged.

Commodity Prices

— We are exposed to commodity
    price volatility related to anticipated purchases of natural
    gas, crude oil and other raw materials and sales of our
    products. We selectively use commodity swap, option, and futures
    contracts with various terms to manage the volatility related to
    these risks. Such contracts are generally limited to durations
    of one year or less. Cash-flow hedge accounting may be elected
    for these derivative transactions. In cases, when the duration
    of a derivative is short, hedge accounting generally would not
    be elected. When hedge accounting is not elected, the changes in
    fair value of these instruments will be recorded in earnings.
    When hedge accounting is elected, gains and losses on these
    instruments will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (“AOCI”), to the extent that the hedge remains
    effective, until the underlying transaction is recognized in
    earnings.

The Company entered into futures contracts with respect to sales
    of gasoline and heating oil. These futures transactions were not
    designated as hedges, and the changes in the fair value of the
    futures contracts were recognized in earnings. In the eight
    months ended December 31, 2010, we settled futures
    positions for gasoline and heating oil of 355 million
    gallons and 349 million gallons, respectively, resulting in
    net gains of $3 million and $8 million, respectively.
    At December 31, 2010, futures contracts for 28 million
    gallons of gasoline and heating oil in the notional amount of
    $70 million, maturing in February 2011, were outstanding.
    The fair values, based on quoted market prices, resulted in a
    net payable of $1 million at December 31, 2010.

In addition, we settled futures positions for crude oil of
    6 million barrels in during the eight months ended
    December 31, 2010, resulting in net gains of
    $3 million. These futures transactions were not designated
    as hedges.

We also entered into futures contracts during the eight months
    ended December 31, 2010 with respect to purchases of crude
    oil and sales of gasoline. These futures transactions were not
    designated as hedges. We settled futures positions for gasoline
    of 1 million barrels in the eight months ended
    December 31, 2010,

resulting in a net gain of $5 million. We settled futures
    positions for crude oil of 1 million barrels in the eight
    months ended December 31, 2010, resulting in a net loss of
    $7 million.

Foreign Currency Rates

— We have significant
    operations in several countries of which functional currencies
    are primarily the U.S. dollar for U.S. operations and
    the Euro for operations in Europe. We enter into transactions
    denominated in other than our functional currency and the
    functional currencies of our subsidiaries and are, therefore,
    exposed to foreign currency risk on receivables and payables. We
    maintain risk management control systems intended to monitor
    foreign currency risk attributable to both the outstanding
    foreign currency balances and future commitments. The risk
    management control systems involve the centralization of foreign
    currency exposure management, the offsetting of exposures and
    the estimating of expected impacts of changes in foreign
    currency rates on our earnings. We enter into foreign currency
    forward contracts to reduce the effects of our net currency
    exchange exposures. At December 31, 2010, foreign currency
    forward contracts in the notional amount of $93 million,
    maturing in January and February 2011, were outstanding. The
    fair value, based on quoted market exchange rates, resulted in a
    net payable of $1 million at December 31, 2010.

For forward contracts that economically hedge recognized
    monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, no hedge
    accounting is applied. Changes in the fair value of foreign
    currency forward contracts are reported in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income and offset the currency exchange results
    recognized on the assets and liabilities.

Foreign Currency Gain (Loss)

— Other income,
    net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income reflected a gain
    of $18 million for the eight months ended December 31,
    2010; losses of $258 million for the four months ended
    April 30, 2010; and gains of $123 million and
    $20 million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, related to changes in currency exchange
    rates.

— Pursuant to the provisions of
    the Plan of Reorganization, $201 million in liabilities
    associated with interest rate swaps designated as cash-flow
    hedges in the notional amount of $2,350 million were
    discharged on April 30, 2010. The Predecessor Company
    discontinued accounting for the interest rate swap as a hedge
    and, in April 2010, $153 million of unamortized loss was
    released from AOCI and recognized in Interest expense on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

Warrants

— As of December 31, 2010,
    LyondellBasell N.V. has warrants to purchase 11,508,104 ordinary
    shares at an exercise price of $15.90 per ordinary share issued
    and outstanding. The warrants have anti-dilution protection for
    in-kind stock dividends, stock splits, stock combinations and
    similar transactions and may be exercised at any time during the
    period from April 30, 2010 to the close of business on
    April 30, 2017. Upon an affiliate change of control, the
    holders of the warrants may put the warrants to LyondellBasell
    N.V. at a price equal to, as applicable, the

in-the-money

value of the warrants or the Black-Scholes value of the warrants.

The fair value of each warrant granted is estimated based on
    quoted market price as of December 31, 2010. A
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate the fair
    value of the warrants at April 30, 2010; therefore, the
    $84 million fair value as of June 30, 2010 has been
    transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 in the
    reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of
    Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, below.

The fair values of the warrants were determined to be
    $215 million and $101 million at December 31,
    2010 and at April 30, 2010, respectively.

For liabilities classified as Level 1, the fair value is
    measured using quoted prices in active markets. The total fair
    value is either the price of the most recent trade at the time
    of the market close or the official close price, as defined by
    the exchange in which the asset is most actively traded on the
    last trading day of the period, multiplied by the number of
    units held without consideration of transaction costs. For
    liabilities classified as Level 2, fair value is based on
    the price a market participant would pay for the security,
    adjusted for the terms specific to that asset and liability.
    Broker quotes were obtained from well established and recognized
    vendors of market data for debt valuations. The inputs for
    liabilities classified as Level 3 reflect our assessment of
    the assumptions that a market participant would use in
    determining the price of the asset or liability, including our
    liquidity risk at December 31, 2010.

The fair values of Level 3 instruments are determined using
    pricing data similar to that used in Level 2 financial
    instruments described above, and reflect adjustments for less
    liquid markets or longer contractual terms. For these
    Level 3 financial instruments, pricing data obtained from
    third party pricing sources is adjusted for the liquidity of the
    underlying over the contractual terms to develop an estimated
    price that market participants would use. Our valuation of these
    instruments considers specific contractual terms, present value
    concepts and other internal assumptions related to
    (i) contract maturities that extend beyond the periods in
    which quoted market prices are available; (ii) the
    uniqueness of the contract terms; and (iii) our
    creditworthiness or that of our counterparties (adjusted for
    collateral related to our asset positions). Based on our
    calculations, we expect that a significant portion of other
    debts will react in a generally proportionate

manner to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Accordingly,
    these financial instruments are fair valued at par and are
    classified as Level 3.

18.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefits

We have defined benefit pension plans which cover employees in
    the U.S. and various

non-U.S. countries.

We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans other than pensions
    that provide medical benefits to our U.S. and Canadian
    employees. In addition, we provide other post employment
    benefits such as early retirement and deferred compensation
    severance benefits to employees of certain

non-U.S. countries.

We use a measurement date of December 31 for all of our benefit
    plans.

Employees in the U.S. are eligible to participate in
    defined contribution plans (Employee Savings Plans) by
    contributing a portion of their compensation. We match a part of
    the employees’ contributions.

Pensions

— Substantially all of our employees
    in Germany are covered under several defined benefit pension
    plans, which provide for benefits based on years of service and
    average rates of pay. Up to a certain salary level, the benefit
    obligations regarding the majority of the German employees are
    covered by contributions of the Company and the employees to the
    Pensionskasse der BASF VVaG. In 2010, our contributions into
    this plan were $7 million. In addition, we offer an
    unfunded supplementary plan for employees earning in excess of
    the local social security limits. For certain employees we offer
    an unfunded pension plan.

For 2010 the actual return on plan assets for the U.S. and

non-U.S. was

15.6% and 8.4%, respectively.

Under the Plan of Reorganization, except with respect to the
    Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, all benefit plans and
    collective bargaining agreements remained in force subsequent to
    the Debtors’ emergence from chapter 11 proceedings.
    Accordingly, approximately $854 million of pension and
    other post-retirement benefit liabilities were reclassified from
    liabilities subject to compromise to current or long-term
    liabilities, as appropriate, upon emergence from bankruptcy (see
    Note 4).

The U.S. bankruptcy court approved the termination of the
    U.S. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans as of
    January 6, 2009. The termination of these plans resulted in
    a gain of $4 million. Due to the bankruptcy no benefits
    were paid as a result of the plan termination. The beneficiaries
    of these plans had outstanding claims of $48 million,
    $8 million of which is related to

non-U.S. employees,

filed with the bankruptcy court. The liability balance for these
    claims was discharged pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization
    (see Note 4).

In 2010, the settlement gain of $15 million in the
    U.S. plans reflected payments of lump sum benefits in the
    Pension Plans for Eligible Hourly Non-Represented Employees of
    Equistar Chemicals, LP and Houston Refining LP Retirement Plan
    for Eligible Hourly Non-Represented Employees. In 2009, the
    settlement gain of $11 million in the U.S. plans
    reflected payments of lump sum benefits in the Pension Plan for
    Eligible Hourly Represented Employees of Equistar Chemicals, LP
    and the Houston Refining LP Retirement Plan for Represented
    Employees.

The accounting for a reduction in expected years of future
    service due to the headcount reduction program resulted in a
    $5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the
    U.S. plans: LyondellBasell Retirement Plan, Equistar
    Chemicals, LP Retirement Plan, and Basell Retirement Income Plan.

Divestitures

— In December 2010, we sold our
    Flavor and Fragrance chemicals business. The plan and related
    obligations covering the retired employees of the business were
    retained by LyondellBasell N.V. As a result of this divestiture,
    the accumulated benefit obligation related to the plan decreased
    by approximately $4 million, resulting in a curtailment.
    The gain associated with the curtailment was not recognized in
    2010 since it does not exceed the unrecognized net loss existing
    under the plan.

The following table sets forth the principal assumptions on
    discount rates, projected rates of compensation increase and
    expected rates of return on plan assets, where applicable. These
    assumptions vary for the different plans, as they are determined
    in consideration of the local conditions.

The assumptions used in determining the net benefit liabilities
    for our pension plans were as follows at December 31:

The discount rate assumptions reflect the rates at which the
    benefit obligations could be effectively settled, based on
    published long-term bond indices where the term closely matches
    the term of the benefit obligations. The expected rate of return
    on assets was estimated based on the plans’ asset
    allocation, a review of historical capital market performance,
    historical plan performance and a forecast of expected future
    asset returns. We review these long-term assumptions on a
    periodic basis.

Our pension plans have not invested in securities of
    LyondellBasell N.V., and there have been no significant
    transactions between any of the pension plans and the Company or
    related parties thereof.

Other Postretirement Benefits

— We sponsor
    unfunded defined benefit health care and life insurance plans
    covering certain eligible retired employees and their spouses.
    Generally, the medical plans pay a stated percentage of medical
    expenses reduced by deductibles and other coverage. Life
    insurance benefits are generally provided by insurance
    contracts. We retain the right, subject to existing agreements,
    to modify or eliminate these benefits.

For the U.S. plans, the assumed annual rate of increase in
    the per capita cost of covered health care benefits as of
    December 31, 2010 was 9.1% for 2011 decreasing 0.5% per
    year to 5.0% in 2026 and thereafter. At December 31, 2010,
    the assumed annual rate of increase was 9.5%. At
    December 31, 2009, the assumed rate of increase was 9.5%
    for 2010 decreasing 0.5% per year to 5% in 2026 and thereafter.
    At December 31, 2009, the assumed annual rate of increase
    was 9.5%. For the Canadian plans, the assumed annual rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
    as of December 31, 2010 was 8.5% for 2011

decreasing 0.5% per year to 5% in 2018 and thereafter. At
    December 31, 2010, the assumed annual rate of increase was
    8.5%. As of December 31, 2009, the assumed annual rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
    for the Canadian plans was 8.5% for 2010 decreasing 0.5% per
    year to 5% in 2017 and thereafter. At December 31, 2009,
    the assumed annual rate of increase was 9.0%. For the French
    plans, the assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita
    cost of covered health care benefits as of December 31,
    2010 was 3.5% for 2011 and at December 31, 2009 was 2.0%
    for 2010 with no available trending.

The health care cost trend rate assumption does not have a
    significant effect on the amounts reported due to limits on
    maximum contribution levels to the medical plans. To illustrate,
    increasing or decreasing the assumed health care cost trend
    rates by one percentage point in each year would change the
    accumulated other postretirement benefit liability as of
    December 31, 2010 by less than $1 million for
    U.S. and $3 million for

non-U.S. plans

and would not have a material effect on the aggregate service
    and interest cost components of the net periodic other
    postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended.

Deferred income taxes related to amounts in Accumulated other

    respectively. At April 30, 2010 all gains and losses in OCI
    and the related deferred income were written off.

At December 31, 2010, AOCI included $2 million of
    prior service credit related to

non-U.S. pension

plans that is expected to be recognized as a component of net
    periodic benefit cost in 2011. There are no such amounts in AOCI

Pension Claim

— Two legacy Basell subsidiaries,
    Basell UK Ltd and Basell Polyolefins UK Ltd were subject to a
    claim totaling £40.8 million ($70.4 million)
    related to exit fees charged by two UK pension funds of a former
    shareholder. The claims were made following the termination of
    the membership of these two subsidiaries in these funds in
    connection with the 2005 acquisition of Basell by Access. These
    claims were net settled with the two pension funds for
    £17 million ($32.1 million) on August 20,
    2008. LyondellBasell AF subsequently initiated arbitration
    proceedings against its former shareholder for indemnification
    of the net

settlement amount. These proceedings were settled in October
    2009 for £9.5 million ($15.7 million), which
    amount was recognized in the 2009 Consolidated Statement of
    Income.

Defined Contribution Plans

— Employees in the
    U.S. are eligible to participate in defined contribution
    plans (“Employee Savings Plans”) by contributing a
    portion of their compensation. We match a part of the
    employees’ contribution. The Predecessor had temporarily
    suspended contributions beginning in March 2009 as a result of
    filing voluntary petitions for reorganization under
    chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In May 2010,
    we resumed matching contributions under the Employee Savings
    Plans. Contributions to these plans were $17 million in
    2010, $8 million in 2009 and $31 million in 2008.

19.

Incentive
    and Share-Based Compensation

Medium-Term Incentive Plan

— Upon the
    Debtors’ emergence from chapter 11 proceedings, we
    replaced the Predecessor Company’s Management Incentive
    Plan with the 2010 Medium-Term Incentive Plan (“MTI”).
    The MTI is designed to link the interests of senior management
    with the interests of shareholders by tying incentives to
    measurable corporate performance. The MTI provides for payouts
    based on our return on assets and cost improvements over the
    calendar years 2010 through 2012. Benefits under the MTI will
    vest on the date, following December 31, 2012, on which the
    Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board certifies the
    performance results and will be paid on March 31 following the
    end of the performance cycle. The MTI provides for an
    accelerated pro-rata payout in the event of a change in control
    of the Successor Company. The MTI, which is accounted for as a
    liability award, is classified in Other liabilities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded $4 million of
    compensation expense for the eight months ended
    December 31, 2010 based on the expected achievement of
    performance results.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

— Upon the
    Debtors’ emergence from chapter 11 proceedings, we
    created the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTI”).
    Under the LTI, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant
    restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock
    appreciation rights and other types of equity-based awards. The
    Compensation Committee determines the recipients of the equity
    awards, the type of award made, the required performance
    measures, and the timing and duration of each grant. The maximum
    number of shares of LyondellBasell N.V. stock reserved for
    issuance under the LTI is 22,000,000. In connection with the
    Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy, awards were granted to
    our senior management and we have since granted awards for new
    hires and promotions. As of December 31, 2010, there were
    9,860,818 shares remaining available for issuance.

The LTI awards resulted in compensation expense of
    $22 million for the eight months ended December 31,
    2010, and $24 million for the four months ended
    April 30, 2010. The tax benefits were $8 million for
    the eight months ended December 31, 2010, and
    $8 million for the four months ended April 30, 2010.

Restricted Stock Units

— Restricted stock units
    entitle the recipient to be paid out an equal number of
    class A ordinary shares on the fifth anniversary of the
    grant date, subject to forfeiture in the event of certain
    termination events. Restricted stock units are accounted for as
    an equity award with compensation cost recognized ratably over
    the vesting period. The holders of the restricted stock units
    are entitled to dividend equivalents to be settled no later than
    March 15th following the year in which dividends are paid, as
    long as the participant is in full employment at the time of
    payment.

    units was $5 million and the related tax benefit was
    $1 million. As of December 31, 2010, the unrecognized
    compensation cost related to restricted stock units was
    $29 million, which is expected to be recognized over a
    weighted-average period of 4 years.

Stock Options

— Stock options are granted with
    an exercise price equal to the market price of class A
    ordinary shares at the date of grant. The stock options are
    accounted for as an equity award with compensation cost
    recognized using the graded vesting method. We issued certain
    Stock options to purchase 1% of the number of common stock
    shares outstanding at the Debtors’ emergence from
    bankruptcy. These options vest in five equal, annual
    installments beginning on May 14, 2009 and may be exercised
    for a period of seven years following the grant date at a price
    of $17.61 per share, the fair value of the Company’s common
    stock based on its reorganized value at the date of emergence.
    All other stock options vest in equal increments on the second,
    third and fourth anniversary of the grant date and have a
    contractual term of ten years, with accelerated vesting upon
    death, disability, or change in control and exercise prices
    ranging from $16.45 to $26.75.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated, based on
    several assumptions, on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option valuation model. Upon adoption of
    ASC 718

Stock Compensation

, we modified our methods
    used to determine these assumptions based on the Securities and
    Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107. We estimated volatility based on the
    historic average of the common stock of our peer companies and
    the historic stock price volatility over the expected term. The
    fair value and the assumptions used for the 2010 grants are
    shown in the table below.

Stock Appreciation Rights

— Certain employees
    in Europe were granted stock appreciation rights
    (“SARs”) under the LTI. SARs gives those employees the
    right to receive an amount of cash equal to the appreciation in
    the market value of the Company’s class A ordinary
    shares from the award’s grant date to the exercise date.
    Because the SAR’s are settled in cash, they are accounted
    for as a liability award. The SARs vest over three years
    beginning with the second anniversary of the grant date. We
    recognized less than $1 million of compensation expense
    related to SARs for the eight months ended December 31,
    2010.

Under the Plan of Reorganization, a substantial portion of the
    Company’s pre-petition debt securities, revolving credit
    facility and other obligations was extinguished. Absent an
    exception, a debtor recognizes cancellation of indebtedness
    income (“CODI”) upon discharge of its outstanding
    indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than
    its adjusted issue price. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
    amended (“IRC”), provides that a debtor in a
    bankruptcy case may exclude CODI from taxable income but must
    reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of any CODI
    realized as a result of the consummation of a plan of
    reorganization. The amount of CODI realized by a taxpayer is the
    adjusted issue price of any indebtedness discharged less the sum
    of (i) the amount of cash paid, (ii) the issue price
    of any new indebtedness issued and (iii) the fair market
    value of any other consideration, including equity, issued. As a
    result of the market value of equity upon emergence from
    chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the estimated amount of
    U.S. CODI exceeded the estimated amount of the
    Company’s U.S. tax attributes by approximately
    $7,433 million. The actual reduction in tax attributes does
    not occur until the first day of our tax year subsequent to the
    date of emergence, or January 1, 2011.

As a result of attribute reduction, we do not expect to retain
    any U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, alternative
    minimum tax credits or capital loss carryforwards. In addition,
    we expect that most, if not all, of our tax bases in depreciable
    assets in the U.S. will be eliminated. Accordingly, we
    expect that the liability for U.S. income taxes in future
    periods will reflect these adjustments and the estimated
    U.S. cash tax liabilities for

the years following 2010 will be significantly higher than in
    2009 or 2010. This situation may be somewhat postponed by the
    temporary bonus depreciation provisions contained in the Job
    Creation Act of 2010 which allow current year expensing for
    certain qualified asset acquisitions.

The Company recorded its adjusted taxes in fresh-start
    accounting without adjustment for estimated changes of tax
    attributes that could occur from May 1, 2010 to
    January 1, 2011, the date of actual reduction of tax
    attributes. Any adjustment to our tax attributes as a result of
    events or transactions that occurred during the period from
    May 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010 was reflected in the
    earnings of the Successor Company.

IRC Sections 382 and 383 provide an annual limitation with
    respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax
    attributes, as well as certain

built-in-losses,

against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change
    in ownership. Our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
    proceedings is considered a change in ownership for purposes of
    IRC Section 382. The limitation under the IRC is based on
    the value of the corporation as of the Emergence Date. We do not
    expect that the application of these limitations will have any
    material affect upon our U.S. federal income tax
    liabilities. Germany has similar provisions that preclude the
    use of certain tax attributes generated prior to a change of
    control. As of the Emergence Date, the Company had tax benefits
    associated with excess interest expense carryforwards in Germany
    in the amount of $20 million that were eliminated as a
    result of the emergence. The reversal of tax benefits associated
    with the loss of these carryforwards is reflected in the
    Predecessor period.

Our current and future provisions for income taxes are
    significantly impacted by the initial recognition of, and
    changes in, valuation allowances in certain countries and are
    dependent upon future earnings and earnings sustainability in
    those jurisdictions. Consequently, our effective income tax rate
    of 10.1% in the Successor period will not be indicative of
    future effective tax rates.

The application of fresh-start accounting on May 1, 2010
    resulted in the re-measurement of deferred income tax
    liabilities associated with the revaluation of the
    Company’s assets and liabilities pursuant to ASC 852
    (see Note 4). As a result, deferred income taxes were
    recorded at amounts determined in accordance with ASC 740
    of $1,049 million. Further, we recorded valuation
    allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets resulting
    from this re-measurement.

The 2010, 2009 and 2008 balances, if recognized subsequent to
    2010, will affect the effective tax rate. The Company operates
    in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world, and its tax
    returns are periodically audited or subject to review by both
    domestic and foreign tax authorities. We are no longer subject
    to any significant income tax examination by tax authorities for
    years prior to 2007 in The Netherlands, Germany and Italy, and
    2008 in the U.S., our principal tax jurisdictions. We settled a
    significant percentage of the total amount of unrecognized tax
    benefits during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the resolution
    of a German income tax audit of certain matters that includes
    years up to and including 2008. In addition, the Company
    recognized $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits that
    were discharged by the bankruptcy court in the predecessor
    period ended April 30, 2010. The recognition of these items
    was recorded as reorganization expense and is not included in
    the income tax accrual. We do not expect any significant changes
    in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits during the next
    12 months.

We recognize interest expense and penalties related to uncertain
    income tax positions in operating expenses. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s accrued liability for
    interest expense was $9 million. There was no accrued
    liability for interest as of December 31, 2010, as the
    future settlement of the uncertain tax positions would not
    result in any payment of interest at this time. No interest was
    accrued during the Predecessor and Successor periods of 2010.
    The Company accrued interest expense of $2 million in 2009
    and in 2008 reversed accruals of $4 million related to
    prior years as a reduction in goodwill. During the four months
    ended April 30, 2010, $2 million of interest was
    discharged upon emergence from bankruptcy. Interest payments of
    $3 million, $3 million and $7 million were made
    in the Successor period and in 2009 and 2008, respectively, in
    connection with various settlements.

Valuation allowances are provided against certain net deferred
    tax assets for tax losses carried forward in Canada, France,
    Japan, Spain, Thailand, Mexico, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

In assessing the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, we
    consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred
    tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of the
    deferred tax assets is dependent upon the scheduled reversal of
    deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
    tax planning strategies. In order to fully realize the deferred
    tax assets related to the net operating losses, we will need to
    generate sufficient future taxable income in the countries where
    these net operating losses exist during the periods in which the
    net operating losses can be utilized. Based upon projections of
    future taxable income over the periods in which the net
    operating losses can be utilized

and/or

the
    temporary differences can be reversed, management believes it is
    more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in excess of
    the valuation allowance of $558 million at
    December 31, 2010 will be realized.

If, in the future, taxable income is generated on a sustained
    basis in jurisdictions where a full valuation allowance has been
    recorded, the conclusion regarding the need for full valuation
    allowances in these tax jurisdictions could change, resulting in
    the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowances. If
    operations generate taxable income prior to reaching
    profitability on a sustained basis, a portion of the valuation
    allowance related to the corresponding realized tax benefit for
    that period will be reversed, without changing the conclusion on
    the need for a full valuation allowance against the remaining
    net deferred tax assets. As a result, our current and future
    provision for income taxes is significantly impacted by the
    initial recognition of, and changes in, valuation allowances in
    certain countries and the Successor period effective tax rate of
    10.1% will not be indicative of our future effective tax rate.

During the Predecessor period, we recorded a valuation allowance
    of $176 million against deferred tax assets, primarily
    related to our French operations and various deferred tax assets
    resulting from the implementation of fresh-start accounting. We
    also reversed $11 million of valuation allowances during
    the Predecessor period related to the Luxembourg entities that
    are no longer a part of the LyondellBasell group following the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. In the Successor
    period, we reversed valuation allowances attributable to our
    Dutch net operating loss carryforwards as improved business
    results combined with a restructuring of debt caused us to
    conclude that it is now more likely than not that the deferred
    tax assets will be realized. We also reversed valuation
    allowances during the Successor period related to a portion of
    our French deferred tax assets

    Taxes — (Continued)

due to a restructuring of our French operations. These reversals
    resulted in a net decrease in income tax expense of
    $250 million in the Successor period. There were also
    changes in the valuation allowances for 2010 related to
    translation adjustments. At the end of 2009, the balance of
    cumulative valuation allowances was $666 million. The only
    changes in the valuation allowance in 2009 were related to
    translation adjustments.

In most cases, deferred taxes have not been provided for
    possible future distributions of earnings of subsidiaries as
    such dividends are not expected to be subject to further
    taxation upon their distribution. Deferred taxes on the
    unremitted earnings of certain equity joint ventures of
    $23 million, and $20 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, have been provided to the extent that
    such earnings are subject to taxation on their future remittance.

LyondellBasell N.V. is incorporated and is resident in The
    Netherlands. However, since the Company’s proportion of
    U.S. revenues, assets, operating income and associated tax
    provisions is significantly greater than any other single taxing
    jurisdiction within the worldwide group, the reconciliation of
    the differences between the provision for income taxes and the
    statutory rate is presented on the basis of the
    U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 35% as opposed to
    the Dutch statutory rate of 25.5% to provide a more meaningful
    insight into those differences. This summary is shown below:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Commitments

— We have various purchase
    commitments for materials, supplies and services incident to the
    ordinary conduct of business, generally for quantities required
    for its businesses and at prevailing market prices. These
    commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not
    expected to be in excess of normal requirements. At
    December 31, 2010, we had commitments of approximately
    $5 million related to rebuilding an expanded world-scale
    high-density polyethylene plant at its Münchsmünster,
    Germany site. Our other capital expenditure commitments at
    December 31, 2010 were in the normal course of business.

Financial Assurance Instruments

— We have
    obtained letters of credit, performance and surety bonds and
    have issued financial and performance guarantees to support
    trade payables, potential liabilities and other obligations.
    Considering the frequency of claims made against the financial
    instruments we use to support our obligations, and the magnitude
    of those financial instruments in light of our current financial
    position, management does not expect that any claims against or
    draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect
    on our consolidated financial statements. We have not
    experienced any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the
    required financial assurance instruments for our current
    operations.

Environmental Remediation

— Our accrued
    liability for future environmental remediation costs at current
    and former plant sites and other remediation sites totaled
    $107 million as of December 31, 2010. The accrued
    liabilities for individual sites range from less than
    $1 million to $37 million. The remediation
    expenditures are expected to occur over a number of years, and
    not to be concentrated in any single year. In our opinion, it is
    reasonably possible that losses in excess of the liabilities
    recorded may have been incurred. However, we cannot estimate any
    amount or range of such possible additional losses. New
    information about sites, new technology or future developments
    such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies,
    could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to
    environmental matters.

    Company’s accrued environmental liability included in

The Debtors resolved substantially all of their liability
    related to third-party sites (including sites where the Debtors
    were subject to a Comprehensive Environmental Response,
    Compensation and Liability Act or similar state order to fund or
    perform such cleanup, such as the river and the other portions
    of the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site that the Debtors do not
    own) through creation of the Environmental Custodial Trust and
    agreement on allowed claim values as set forth in the
    Debtors’ Third Amended Plan of Reorganization and
    Settlement Agreement Among the Debtors, the Environmental
    Custodial Trust Trustee, The United States, and certain
    environmental Agencies filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
    on March 30, 2010 and approved by the court on
    April 23, 2010. Upon the Debtors’ emergence from
    bankruptcy, certain real properties owned by the Debtors,
    including the Schedule III Debtors (as defined in the Plan
    of Reorganization), were transferred to the

Environmental Custodial Trust, which now owns and is responsible
    for these properties. Consistent with the Debtors’
    settlement with the governmental agencies and its Plan of
    Reorganization, approximately $170 million of cash was also
    used to fund the Environmental Custodial Trust and to make
    certain direct payments to the Environmental Protection Agency
    and certain state environmental agencies.

Litigation and Other Matters

— On
    April 12, 2005, BASF Corporation (“BASF”) filed a
    lawsuit in New Jersey against Lyondell Chemical asserting
    various claims relating to alleged breaches of a product sales
    contract and seeking damages in excess of $100 million.
    Lyondell Chemical denied it breached the contracts. Lyondell
    Chemical believed the maximum refund due to BASF was
    $22.5 million on such product sales and has paid such
    amount to BASF. On August 13, 2007, the jury returned a
    verdict in favor of BASF in the amount of approximately
    $170 million (which includes the above $22.5 million).
    On October 3, 2007, the judge determined that prejudgment
    interest on the verdict was $36 million and issued a final
    judgment. Lyondell Chemical appealed this verdict and has posted
    a bond, which is collateralized by a $200 million letter of
    credit.

On April 21, 2010, oral arguments related to the appeal
    were held and on December 28, 2010, the judgment was
    reversed and the case was remanded. The parties have filed
    motions with the Bankruptcy Court for a determination as to
    whether the case will proceed in the Bankruptcy Court or New
    Jersey state court. We do not expect the ultimate resolution of
    this matter to have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
    operations, although it is possible that any such resolution
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation
    for any period in which a resolution occurs.

On December 20, 2010, one of our subsidiaries received
    demand letters from affiliates of Access Industries, a
    shareholder of the Company. The Access affiliates have demanded
    that our subsidiary, LyondellBasell Industries Holdings B.V.
    (“LBIH”) indemnify them and their shareholders,
    members, affiliates, officers, directors, employees and other
    related parties for all losses, including attorney’s fees
    and expenses, arising out of a pending lawsuit and pay
    $50 million in management fees for 2009 and 2010 in
    addition to other unspecified amounts related to advice
    purportedly given in connection with financing and other
    strategic transactions. We conducted an initial investigation of
    the facts underlying the demand letters and engaged in
    discussions with Access. We requested that Access withdraw its
    demands, and on January 17, 2011, Access declined to
    withdraw its demands.

In the pending lawsuit, the plaintiffs are seeking damages from
    numerous parties, including Access and its affiliates. The
    damages sought from Access and its affiliates include, among
    other things, the return of all amounts earned by them related
    to their acquisition of shares of Lyondell Chemical prior to its
    acquisition by Basell AF S.C.A. in December 2007, distributions
    by Basell AF S.C.A. to its shareholders before it acquired
    Lyondell Chemical, and management and transaction fees and
    expenses. We cannot at this time determine the amount of
    liability, if any, that may be sought from LBIH by way of
    indemnity if a judgment is rendered or a settlement is paid in
    the lawsuit.

The Access affiliates assert that LBIH’s responsibility for
    indemnity and the claimed fees and expenses arises out of a
    management agreement entered into on December 11, 2007,
    between Nell and Basell AF S.C.A. They assert that LBIH, as a
    former subsidiary of Basell AF S.C.A., is jointly and severally
    liable for Basell AF S.C.A.’s obligations under the
    agreement, notwithstanding that LBIH was not a signatory to the
    agreement and the liabilities of Basell AF S.C.A., which was a
    signatory, were discharged in the LyondellBasell bankruptcy
    proceedings.

We do not believe that the management agreement is in effect or
    that the Company, LBIH, or any other Company-affiliated entity
    owes any obligations under the management agreement. We intend
    to defend vigorously any proceedings, claims or demands that may
    be asserted.

Indemnification

— We are parties to various
    indemnification arrangements, including arrangements entered
    into in connection with acquisitions, divestitures and the
    formation of joint ventures. Pursuant to these arrangements, we
    provide indemnification to

and/or

receive indemnification from other parties in connection with
    liabilities that may arise in connection with the transactions
    and in connection with activities prior to completion of the
    transactions. These indemnification arrangements typically
    include provisions pertaining to third party claims relating to
    environmental and tax matters and various types of litigation.
    As of December 31, 2010, we had not accrued any significant
    amounts for our indemnification obligations, and we are not
    aware of other circumstances that would likely lead to
    significant future indemnification obligations. We cannot
    determine with certainty the potential amount of future payments
    under the indemnification arrangements until events arise that
    would trigger a liability under the arrangements.

In addition, certain third parties entered into agreements with
    the Predecessor, LyondellBasell AF, to indemnify LyondellBasell
    AF for a significant portion of the potential obligations that
    could arise with respect to costs relating to contamination at
    the Berre site in France and the Ferrara and Brindisi sites in
    Italy. These indemnity obligations are currently in dispute. We
    recognized a pretax charge of $64 million as a change in
    estimate in the third quarter 2010 related to the dispute, which
    arose during that period.

As part of our technology licensing contracts, we give
    indemnifications to our licensees for liabilities arising from
    possible patent infringement claims with respect to proprietary
    licensed technology. Such indemnifications have a stated maximum
    amount and generally cover a period of five to ten years.

Other

— We have identified an agreement related
    to a former project in Kazakhstan under which a payment was made
    that raises compliance concerns under the U.S. Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”). We have engaged
    outside counsel to investigate these activities, under the
    oversight of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, and
    to evaluate internal controls and compliance policies and
    procedures. We made a voluntary disclosure of these matters to
    the U.S. Department of Justice and are cooperating fully
    with that agency. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
    these matters at this time since our investigations are ongoing.
    In this respect, we may not have conducted business in
    compliance with the FCPA and may not have had policies and
    procedures in place adequate to ensure compliance. Therefore, we
    cannot reasonably estimate a range of liability for any
    potential penalty resulting from these matters. Violations of
    these laws could result in criminal and civil liabilities and
    other forms of relief that could be material to us.

Certain of our

non-U.S. subsidiaries

conduct business in countries subject to U.S. economic
    sanctions, including Iran. U.S. and European laws and
    regulations prohibit certain persons from engaging in business
    activities, in whole or in part, with sanctioned countries,
    organizations and individuals. We have made voluntary disclosure
    of these matters to the U.S. Treasury Department and intend
    to cooperate fully with that agency. The ultimate outcome of
    this matter cannot be predicted at this time because our
    investigations are ongoing. Therefore, we cannot reasonably
    estimate a range of liability for any potential penalty
    resulting from these matters. In addition, we have made the
    decision to cease all business with the government, entities and
    individuals in Iran, Syria and Sudan. We have notified our
    counterparties in these countries of our decision and may be
    subject to legal actions to enforce agreements with the
    counterparties. These activities present a potential risk that
    could subject the Company to civil and criminal penalties as
    well as private legal proceedings that could be material to us.
    We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this
    time because our investigations and withdrawal activities are
    ongoing.

We and our joint ventures are, from time to time, defendants in
    lawsuits and other commercial disputes, some of which are not
    covered by insurance. Many of these suits make no specific claim
    for relief. Although final determination of any liability and
    resulting financial impact with respect to any such matters
    cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty, we do not
    believe that any ultimate uninsured liability resulting from

these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a
    material adverse effect on the financial position, liquidity or
    results of operations of LyondellBasell N.V.

General

— In our opinion, the matters discussed
    in this note are not expected to have a material adverse effect
    on the financial position or liquidity of LyondellBasell N.V.
    However, the adverse resolution in any reporting period of one
    or more of these matters could have a material impact on our
    results of operations for that period, which may be mitigated by
    contribution or indemnification obligations of others, or by any
    insurance coverage that may be available.

Stockholders’
    Equity (Deficit) and Non-Controlling Interests

Common Stock

— On April 30, 2010,
    approximately 563.9 million shares of LyondellBasell N.V.
    common stock, including 300 million shares of class A
    new ordinary shares were issued in exchange for allowed claims
    under the Plan of Reorganization. In addition, approximately
    263.9 million shares of LyondellBasell N.V. class B
    ordinary shares were issued in connection with a rights offering
    for gross proceeds of $2.8 billion. On December 6,
    2010, 263.9 million class B ordinary shares converted
    into class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis in
    accordance with their terms.

Dividend distribution

— Our credit arrangements
    include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay
    dividends up to $50 million per year through
    December 31, 2011 and to the greater of
    (i) $50 million per year and (ii) the aggregate
    dividends paid since April 30, 2010 not to exceed fifty
    percent of net income since January 1, 2012 and thereafter.

Conversion of Class B Ordinary Shares

—
    Our Articles of Association provided that at the earlier of
    (i) the request of the relevant holder of class B
    ordinary shares with respect to the number of class B
    ordinary shares specified by such holder; (ii) acquisition
    by us of one or more class B ordinary shares; or
    (iii) the first date upon which the closing price per share
    of the class B ordinary shares has exceeded 200% of $10.61
    for at least forty-five trading days within a period of sixty
    consecutive trading days (provided that the closing price per
    share of the class B ordinary shares exceeded such
    threshold on both the first and last day of the sixty day
    period), each such class B ordinary share would be
    converted into one class A ordinary share. At the close of
    business on December 6, 2010, the provision in
    (iii) was met, and the 263.9 million class B
    ordinary shares outstanding as of that date had not previously
    been converted in accordance with (i), above, converted into an
    equal number of Class A ordinary shares.

Treasury shares

— In connection with our
    formation, we issued one million one hundred twenty-five
    thousand (1,125,000), four Eurocent (€0.04) each,
    class A ordinary shares for €45 thousand to Stichting
    TopCo, a foundation formed under the laws of The Netherlands
    (the “Foundation”). On April 30, 2010, the
    Foundation transferred the shares from the Foundation for nil
    consideration. These shares are classified as Treasury Stock on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Segment
    and Related Information

We operate in five segments:

•

Olefins and Polyolefins

— Americas, primarily
    manufacturing and marketing of olefins, including ethylene and
    its co-products, primarily propylene, butadiene, and aromatics,
    which include benzene and toluene, as well as ethanol; and
    polyolefins, including polyethylene, comprising HDPE, LDPE and
    linear low density polyethylene (“LLDPE”), and
    polypropylene; and

Catalloy

process resins;

•

Olefins and Polyolefins

— Europe, Asia,
    International, primarily manufacturing and marketing of olefins,
    including ethylene and its co-products, primarily propylene and
    butadiene; polyolefins, including polyethylene, comprising HDPE,
    LDPE and polypropylene; polypropylene-based compounds, materials
    and alloys (“PP Compounds”),

Catalloy

process
    resins and polybutene-1 polymers;

•

Intermediates and Derivatives (“I&D”), primarily
    manufacturing and marketing of PO; PO co-products, including
    styrene and the TBA intermediates tertiary butyl alcohol
    (“TBA”), isobutylene and tertiary butyl hydroperoxide;
    PO derivatives, including propylene glycol, propylene glycol
    ethers and butanediol; ethylene derivatives, including ethylene
    glycol, ethylene oxide (“EO”), and other EO
    derivatives; acetyls, including vinyl acetate monomer, acetic
    acid and methanol and fragrance and flavor chemicals;

•

Refining and Oxyfuels, primarily manufacturing and marketing of
    refined petroleum products, including gasoline, ultra-low sulfur
    diesel, jet fuel, lubricants (“lube oils”), alkylate,
    and oxygenated fuels, or oxyfuels, such as methyl tertiary butyl
    ether (“MTBE”), ethyl tertiary butyl ether
    (“ETBE”); and

•

Technology, primarily licensing of polyolefin process
    technologies and supply of polyolefin catalysts and advanced
    catalysts.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies” (see Note 2), except that the
    Predecessor’s segment operating results reported to
    management reflected costs of sales determined using current
    costs, which approximated results using the LIFO method of
    accounting for inventory. These current cost-basis operating
    results are reconciled to consolidated operating income in the
    Predecessor tables below. Sales between segments are made
    primarily at prices approximating prevailing market prices.

No customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s
    consolidated sales during any year in the three-year period
    ended December 31, 2010.

On December 22, 2010, we completed the sale of our Flavor
    and Fragrance chemicals business, including production assets in
    Jacksonville, Florida and Colonels Island, Georgia, related
    inventories, receivables, contracts, customer lists,
    intellectual property and certain liabilities, receiving
    proceeds of $154 million. As a result, the Flavor and
    Fragrance chemicals business, which was part of our I&D
    segment, is presented as discontinued operations and therefore
    excluded from the operations of the I&D segment below in
    the Successor period.

On September 1, 2008, LyondellBasell AF completed the sale
    of its TDI business, including production assets in
    Pont-du-Claix, France, related inventories, contracts, customer
    lists and intellectual property, receiving net proceeds of
    €77 million ($113 million). As a result,
    LyondellBasell AF’s TDI business, which was part of
    LyondellBasell AF’s I&D segment, is presented as
    discontinued operations and therefore is excluded from the
    operations of the I&D segment below in the Predecessor
    periods.

Segment
    and Related Information — (Continued)

Sales and other operating revenues and operating income (loss)
    in the “Other” column above include elimination of
    intersegment transactions and businesses that are not reportable
    segments in the periods presented.

In the Successor period, we recognized a $64 million charge
    related to a change in estimate associated with a dispute over
    environmental liability, including $35 million,
    $21 million, and $8 million related to the
    O&P — EAI, Refining and Oxyfuels, and Technology
    business segments, respectively. The Successor period also
    includes a $28 million charge associated with the Refining
    and Oxyfuels business segment, primarily related to impairment
    of capital additions for the Berre refinery. These charges are
    reflected in Cost of sales and Impairments, respectively, on the
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

In 2009, LyondellBasell AF recognized charges of
    $696 million to write off the carrying value of assets,
    $679 million of which are reflected in “Reorganization
    items,” on the Consolidated Statements of Income. These
    charges included $624 million related to the
    O&P — Americas business segment, all of which was
    associated with a lease rejection at an olefin plant at
    Chocolate Bayou, Texas and $55 million related to the
    I&D business segment associated with an interest in an
    ethylene glycol facility in Beaumont, Texas.

Also in 2009, operating results for the O&P —
    Americas and Refining and Oxyfuels business segments included
    charges of $47 million and $9 million, respectively,
    primarily for impairment of the carrying value of surplus
    emission allowances related to HRVOCs and

non-U.S. emission

rights (see Note 11).

The remaining $17 million, which is included in
    “Impairments” on the Consolidated Statements of Income
    related to the O&P — EAI business segment,
    including $6 million was related to an LDPE plant at
    Fos-sur-Mer, France, $6 million related to the closure of a
    polypropylene line at Wesseling, Germany, $3 million
    related to an LDPE plant at Carrington, U.K. and $1 million
    related to an advanced polyolefins compounding facility in
    Mansfield, Texas.

In 2009 LyondellBasell AF determined that there had been a
    diminution in the value of its investments in certain joint
    ventures and such loss was other than temporary. This
    determination resulted in pretax impairment charges of
    $228 million that was included in “Income (loss) from
    equity investments” for 2009 in the O&P —
    EAI business segment.

None.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

This annual report does not include a report of
    management’s assessment regarding our internal control over
    financial reporting or an attestation report of the
    Company’s registered public accounting firm due to a
    transition period established by rules of the Securities and
    Exchange Commission for newly public companies.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed
    to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required
    to disclose in reports that we file or submit with the SEC is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified by the SEC. An evaluation was carried out
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
    (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”),
    of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
    as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not
    effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
    required to be disclosed in reports we file with the SEC is
    processed, summarized and reported accurately as of the end of
    the period covered by this annual report. This ineffectiveness
    was caused by the material weakness described below.

Nevertheless, based on a number of factors, including the
    performance of additional procedures by management designed to
    ensure the correctness of our tax provision and reliability of
    our financial reporting, we believe that the consolidated
    financial statements in this annual report fairly present, in
    all material respects, our financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods,
    presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.

Material
    Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company has identified a material weakness in its internal
    controls. The Company did not maintain adequate controls over
    the accounting for income taxes related to consideration of the
    nonrecurring tax effects of fresh start accounting under ASC
    Topic 852 “Reorganizations.” Specifically the
    preparation and presentation of the complex information
    supporting deferred tax accounting and related disclosures was
    not sufficient to allow an effective review of that information.
    Additionally, the analysis of the tax provision information was
    not sufficient to ensure deferred taxes were accurately
    accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP in the
    appropriate predecessor and successor periods. This control
    deficiency resulted in the misstatement of the deferred tax
    provision in the successor period for the eight months ended
    December 31, 2010 included in the Company’s press
    release dated February 18, 2011 as furnished to the SEC
    under Item 2.02 of

Form 8-K

on February 18, 2011. The control deficiency also resulted
    in a revision of deferred tax expense and reorganization items
    in the predecessor period for the four months ended
    April 30, 2010 and of deferred tax liability and goodwill
    in the opening balance sheet at May 1, 2010 (not presented)
    included in the February 18, 2011 press release and
    included in our

Form 10-Q

for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. This control
    deficiency, if not corrected, could result in a material
    misstatement of the income tax account that would result in a
    material misstatement in our annual or interim consolidated
    financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on
    a timely basis.

We conducted a detailed review of our tax basis balance sheet
    accounts at December 31, 2010 including a detailed analysis
    of the tax provision to ensure deferred taxes were accurately
    accounted for in the appropriate predecessor and successor
    periods as reported in this annual report.



Plan for
    Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Controls

To remediate the material weakness identified, we are
    implementing improvements to our internal controls over the
    calculation of our income tax provision and related balance
    sheet accounts. Specifically, we are implementing improved
    reporting processes to provide clarity of presentation and
    supporting documentation of the tax provision information
    including the implementation of standardization and enhanced
    utilization of tax reporting software to allow timely and
    effective review and analysis of the tax provision information.

We believe these actions will effectively remediate our internal
    control over financial reporting and enhance our disclosure
    controls and procedures.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes
    in our internal control over financial reporting during the
    quarter ended December 31, 2010. We determined that there
    were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Equity
    Compensation Plan Table

The following table provides information as of December 31,
    2010 about the number of shares to be issued upon vesting or
    exercise of equity awards and the number of shares remaining
    available for issuance under our 2010 Long Term Incentive Plan
    (the “2010 LTIP”).

The 2010 LTIP provides for the issuance of up to 22 million
    ordinary shares pursuant to stock options, stock awards and
    stock appreciation rights. No awards may be granted after ten
    years of the effective date of the plan. The 2010 LTIP was
    approved by the Bankruptcy Court and became effective upon our
    emergence from bankruptcy. The plan is categorized as “not
    approved by security holders,” because it has not been
    approved by our shareholders since our listing on the NYSE. As
    described, the 2010 LTIP was a considered part of our
    capitalization in connection with emergence and was approved by
    our shareholder at that time.
