BUSINESS

Overview

ABIOMED is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
medical products designed to safely and effectively assist or replace the
pumping function of the failing heart. ABIOMED’s BVS 5000 console and blood
pump comprise the most widely used advanced heart assist system for the
treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts in
the U.S.  Our AB5000 Circulatory Support
System is a new and improved heart assist product model.  Introduced during fiscal 2004, the AB5000
incorporate a number of advanced features to facilitate patient mobility and
transport and to better meet the needs of physicians and hospitals treating
heart assist patients.  The AB5000
console is also designed to provide a unique adaptable common platform for a
family of blood pumps which in the future, subject to FDA approval, we will be
able to support a broader population of patients for longer periods of time.
Our AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart, the world’s only battery-powered implantable
replacement heart system, is the subject of an ongoing initial clinical trial
that began in July 2001.  The
AbioCor, the development of which follows decades of fundamental and applied
research and testing, is intended to extend life and provide an improved
quality of life for end-stage acute and chronic heart failure patients.  We are also engaged in research and
development relating to other devices to assist or replace the pumping function
of the heart.  Another area of research
and development for ABIOMED is the continued enhancement of our product line to
serve more patients who require mechanical heart assistance.  Another area of focused effort involves
adaptation and development of the AbioCor II Heart, based on technology
acquired in 2000 from The Pennsylvania State University. The AbioCor II Heart
has a drive mechanism that is different than the AbioCor design, and is the
only implantable heart system other than the AbioCor to survive the rigor of
the replacement heart development program funded by the U.S. National Heart
Lung and Blood Institute (“NHLBI”).

Our BVS is a “bridge-to-recovery” device that can temporarily
assume the pumping function of the heart for patients with potentially
reversible heart failure. It is intended for use in patients whose hearts can
recover within a period of a few weeks. In 1992, the BVS became the first heart
assist device capable of providing full circulatory support to be approved by
the FDA. The BVS is the most widely used FDA-approved temporary heart assist
device, and to date has been used to support thousands of patients at over 600
medical centers worldwide. The BVS primarily consists of single-use external
blood pumps and cannulae, and a drive and control console.

In April 2003, we received FDA approval to market the AB5000
Circulatory Support System Console, and in September 2003 we received
approval to market the AB5000 Ventricle, an advanced circulatory support blood
pump model.   The new console can drive
and control either BVS or AB5000 blood pumps, and provides an upgradeable
platform for continued circulatory assist product line enhancements.  The AB5000 was introduced with the same
indications for use as the BVS, but it is our intention to seek FDA approval
for expanded indications of use for the AB5000 to encompass broader patient
populations and lengthened periods of patient support.

Our AbioCor is a heart replacement device that replaces the
failing ventricles of a patient’s diseased heart and takes over the heart’s
blood pumping function. It is designed for use in patients at risk of imminent
death due to irreparable heart damage, but whose other vital organs remain
viable. We believe the AbioCor will provide a much-needed treatment option for
those patients in the U.S. for whom no effective therapy is currently
available.  ABIOMED is developing a
smaller replacement heart that will provide the capability to serve more
patients than the present AbioCor.

Our focused research and development related to these products has
provided us with the proprietary technology, know-how and experience that we
are using to develop additional products. We believe we are the only company in
the world with technical background and expertise in the full range of
technology to


support the pumping function of the heart. We believe that there
are many opportunities to apply our expertise to address the needs of heart
failure patients. We seek to be first to market with high-quality and
cost-effective technologies for heart failure patients who currently lack
adequate therapies.

Industry Overview

Heart Disease

Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S.,
claiming approximately 700,000 lives in 2002. 
Illnesses and deaths from heart disease create an immense burden to many
individuals and their families. Patients frequently experience extended
suffering, and substantial economic cost. While a number of therapies exist for
the treatment of patients in the early stages of heart disease, limited
therapies exist today for most patients with severe end-stage heart failure.

The majority of deaths from heart disease can be attributed to
coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure. Other types of heart
disease include rhythm disorders and diseases of the valves.

Coronary heart disease is a disease of the coronary arteries
causing reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected
portion of the heart. Coronary heart disease can lead to a heart attack, also
known as an acute myocardial infarction, resulting in permanent damage to the
heart muscle. In severe heart attacks, death can occur suddenly or gradually
over days and weeks.

Congestive heart failure is a condition resulting from the
progressive deterioration of the heart over extended periods of time. The
patient’s heart cannot provide adequate blood flow and oxygen to meet the needs
of the body. Congestive heart failure may be initiated and aggravated by a
variety of factors, including high blood pressure, defective heart valves,
coronary heart disease, infections of the heart muscle or the valves and heart
problems resulting from heart defects. Due to the progressive nature of
congestive heart failure, medical interventions often take place over periods
of months or years.

In general, heart failure is progressive. While approximately 63%
of all heart failure patients experience sudden death as a result of cardiac
arrest, the remaining patients who die from heart failure typically do so in
hospitals or long-term care facilities.

Prevalence, Incidence
and Mortality

The American Heart Association reports that in 2002, a total of
64.4 million people in the United States were alive with some form of
cardiovascular disease, including 50 million with high blood pressure.  Of those 13.2 million were diagnosed with
coronary heart disease, 5 million with congestive heart failure, and 4.8 million
had suffered from stroke. Thus, coronary heart disease patients outnumbered
congestive heart failure patients by approximately 2.6:1.  For patients newly diagnosed within 2002,
however, the ratio of coronary heart disease to congestive heart failure patients
was 2.4:1, indicating that congestive heart failure may be becoming relatively
more prevalent as time goes on.  We
believe that this trend is primarily attributable to the aging of the
population. Congestive heart failure is primarily a condition of the elderly.


According to the National Center for Health Statistics,
approximately 700,000 people died of heart disease in the U.S. in 2002.  According to the same source, nearly 500,000
of these deaths were attributable to coronary (ischemic) heart disease,
approximately 57,000 were attributable to congestive heart failure, and
approximately 140,000 were attributable to other diagnoses.  We believe that a close examination of the
various categories included in those other diagnoses reveals that many of those
deaths may have been attributable to congestive heart failure related
conditions.

Therapies for Heart
Disease

A broad spectrum of treatment is available for heart disease
patients.  Treatments include drug
therapies, cardiological interventions, including closed chest procedures and
rhythm management therapies, or surgical corrections, such as coronary bypass
surgery and valve replacement. These therapies are sometimes successful in
slowing the progression of heart disease, extending life, and/or improving the
quality of life for some period of time. 
For patients with end-stage heart disease, however, these treatments are
typically inadequate. Patients with the most severe heart disease, those at identifiable
risk of death, frequently are in need of mechanical circulatory support or
heart replacement. Because the supply of available donor hearts is limited,
with fewer than 2,200 per year available in the U.S., heart assist and
replacement treatments have been and continue to be developed with the goal of
extending and improving the lives of these patients.

The Market for
Circulatory Support Devices in the U.S.

At present, due to the stage of technological development,
circulatory support devices are typically used only after other, less-invasive
therapies have been found to be inadequate. 
The appropriate reference group from which to begin analysis of the
potential market for these devices in the U.S. alone is therefore the 700,000
patients who die each year of heart disease. 
In the future, when devices have matured and become more durable and
reliable, and surgical and patient management techniques have improved, these
devices may become appropriate choices for less emergently ill patients and the
potential addressable market may be much larger.

Not all of the 700,000 patients who die each year of heart disease
are addressable by circulatory support devices.  Many patients not classifiable as coronary heart disease or
congestive heart failure patients are not suitable candidates for circulatory
support.  In addition, a majority of
coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure patients die suddenly,
outside of the hospital or in the Emergency Room, and therefore cannot be
reached by this therapy.  Some suffer
significant comorbidities that might rule out device implantation, and many are
simply too frail to withstand the rigors of device implantation and surgical
recovery.  As a result we estimate that
the total number of patients addressable today by mechanical circulatory
support devices ranges from 60,000 to 120,000 patients per year in the U.S.

This and any other estimate of market size should be viewed as
dynamic and subject to change on account of a variety of factors.  For example, both the percentage of heart
disease patients who are unreachable because they die suddenly and the
percentage of patients who are untreatable because of frailty are important
determinants of the total circulatory support device market.  Both of those variables are susceptible to
change over time as technology improves and patient management techniques
mature.  The total size of the market
will also be affected by demographic trends, most particularly by the aging of
the so-called “baby boom” generation. 
That generation is just approaching the age at which heart disease
becomes a major medical problem, and it is reasonable to postulate that the
pool of heart disease patients will increase as the baby boom generation ages.

Current penetration of the potential market for circulatory
support devices, measured by number of devices implanted annually, is low but
is expected to increase fairly rapidly in the next few years.  An independent report by Health Research
International, published in March 2004, estimated the total value of
advanced mechanical circulatory support sales in 2004 to be $145.9 million, and
projected a compound annual growth rate of 43.1% from 2002 through 2008.


Temporary Heart Assist

. Candidates for temporary heart
assist devices include patients with severe but potentially reversible heart
failure and patients whose hearts need help pumping blood while they await
transplantation or other therapies. Temporary heart assist devices typically
consist of a specialized pump that is attached to a patient’s heart and driven
by a console or powered by an external battery pack. Such devices are intended
to be removed from a patient’s body once the patient’s heart has had the
opportunity to recover its normal function, or when the patient receives the
next appropriate therapy. Temporary heart assist devices can be grouped into
three categories:

Bridge-to-Recovery

. Bridge-to-recovery devices are used to support patients with
potentially reversible heart failure. These devices are most frequently used to
support patients whose hearts do not fully restart following open-heart
surgery, and who cannot be weaned off the heart-lung machine. Of the patients
who experience such complications, many who die each year could potentially be
saved with a temporary assist device as a “bridge to recovery”.
Bridge-to-recovery devices temporarily assume the pumping function of the
heart, while allowing the heart to rest, heal and recover its normal function.
These devices can also be used for patients who have not undergone surgery but
whose lives are threatened by viral infections that attack the heart muscle. In
addition, bridge-to-recovery devices may prove beneficial to certain patients
who have suffered from a recent heart attack.

The number of patients who might be candidates for a
bridge-to-recovery device on account of post-cardiotomy shock each year is a
function of the number of patients who undergo open-heart surgery and the
percentage of such surgeries that result in shock.  There are approximately 400,000 open heart operations annually in
the United States, a number that has steadily been trending down as medical
practice shifts toward less-invasive options. 
According to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac
Surgery Database, 3.4% of coronary artery bypass operations in 1999 resulted in
cardiogenic shock, yielding a potential bridge-to-recovery market of
approximately 14,000 patients.  In 2002,
the Society of Thoracic Surgeons reported that the cardiogenic shock rate had
dropped to 1.9 %, yielding an estimated market of approximately 7,500 patients
in the U.S. per year.

Bridge-to-Transplant

. Bridge-to-transplant devices are used to support patients who
have experienced life-threatening heart disease and are awaiting heart
transplantation. We believe that the market for this category of device is
limited by the size of the transplant waiting list.  Approximately 3,000 patients are added to the transplant list
each year, and approximately 2,200 patients receive a human heart transplant
annually.  We estimate that the
potential U.S. bridge-to-transplant market is therefore something less than
3,000 patients per year.

Staging

. Staging devices are used to support patients before or during
application of other therapies and to support patients with failing hearts
being transported to other facilities. At present, for reasons of specialized
care, patients are transported between medical centers with the assistance of
such devices under hospital guidelines. In other cases, patients initially
placed on mechanical support for bridge-to-recovery are moved to a
bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy device.  In the future, staging devices could potentially be used to
support and stabilize heart failure patients during a course of therapy and
assessment leading to potential implantation of a permanent heart assist device
or a heart replacement.  In addition,
while bridge-to-recovery devices are approved and used today to assist heart
transplant patients when rejection occurs, in the future staging devices may be
used with transplant patients who have rejected their donor heart and need life
support before receiving an implantable replacement heart.

At present, there are two potential therapies other than
transplant to which patients might be bridged in the reasonably near term: a
permanent heart assist device, typically referred to as ventricular assist
device (“VAD”) or a permanent heart replacement device.  The first FDA approval of a left ventricular
assist device, referred to as an LVAD, for destination therapy occurred in
November 2002.  No replacement
heart has yet been approved by the FDA for commercial use.  There is therefore little empirical basis
for estimating what proportion of destination circulatory support device
patients will require a bridge device prior to implantation of a destination
device.  Our estimates of this potential
market in the U.S. range from 20,000 to 40,000 patients per year.


Destination
Therapy

.
Devices intended to be within or attached to patients for their remaining lives
are classified as destination therapies. Destination therapy devices consist of
replacement hearts and permanent assist devices, including devices that provide
partial support to the heart on a permanent basis.

Heart Replacement

. The goal of heart replacement, whether with a donor heart or a
mechanical device, is to replace the failing human heart with a viable
alternative. Patients with irreparably damaged hearts who are facing imminent
death are potential candidates for heart replacement provided that their other
vital organs remain viable. The supply of human donor hearts is extremely
limited and unlikely to increase meaningfully, and no device is yet approved
for use in these patients. The AbioCor is the first permanent heart replacement
device to commence clinical trials for this purpose. We believe that tens of
thousands of patients per year might eventually benefit from an implantable
replacement heart once it is proven safe, effective and reliable.

Permanent Heart Assist

. Permanent assist devices are being developed to supplement the
function of the diseased heart or to stop or slow the progression of the
disease, while leaving the diseased heart in place. These devices contrast with
replacement hearts, which are intended to replace a severely and irreversibly
damaged heart. A number of companies are developing permanent heart assist
devices, some of which are in clinical trials in the U.S. and overseas. Certain
of these assist devices are in advanced stages of clinical testing and pursuing
regulatory approval. One implantable left ventricular assist device, or LVAD,
has been approved in the U.S. for commercial use as a destination device.

We estimate the U.S. market for all destination therapy
circulatory support devices is approximately the same as the total device
market of between 60,000 and 120,000 patients. 
The distribution of those patients between assist devices and
replacement devices is subject to debate among clinicians and cannot be
definitively determined until both classes of device are clinically available
and considerable clinical experience has been gained.  Major variables include the percentage of congestive heart
failure patients in the group who would require long term biventricular
support, and would therefore require a replacement heart, and the percentage of
the coronary heart disease patients in the group who have isolated left-side
damage and therefore might be adequately treated with an LVAD.  At least two different registries from
different manufacturers of temporary ventricular assist devices in commercial
use over a period of more than ten years indicate an incidence of approximately
50% biventricular support and 50% univentricular support.  If and when the technology advances to the
point where, in addition to safety and efficacy, implanted patients can live
without constant awareness that their heart has been replaced or is being
permanently assisted, then the potential use of these devices could increase
significantly.

ABIOMED Products and
Products Under Development

Our current commercial heart assist product line consists of the
BVS and AB5000 models. Our primary products under development are the AbioCor
system, a second generation replacement heart, the AbioCor II, incorporating
elements of the Penn State Heart technology, and enhancements to our heart
assist product line. Each of these products are systems consisting of various
component elements.

Heart Assist: The BVS
5000 Biventricular Support System and the AB5000 Circulatory Support System

The BVS was the first heart assist device capable of assuming the
pumping function of the heart to be approved by the FDA, and is the most widely
used heart assist device today, with thousands of patients supported to date.
It is a bridge-to-recovery device designed to provide a patient’s failing heart
with full circulatory assistance while allowing the heart to rest, heal and
recover its function. The BVS can support the left, right or both ventricles of
the heart. The average age of patients supported with the BVS is 53; however
the BVS has been used to support patients as young as 8 and as old as 86 years
old.


The BVS is most frequently used in patients whose hearts fail to
recover function immediately following heart surgery. The FDA approved the BVS
for use with these post-surgical patients in November 1992. In 1996, the
FDA approved use of the BVS for all other categories of post-surgical patients
with potentially reversible heart failure. In 1997, the FDA approved use of the
BVS on patients who, prior to BVS insertion, are non-surgical patients with
abrupt heart failure as a result of viral attack of the heart or certain heart
attacks, expanding its use to the temporary treatment of all patients with
potentially reversible heart failure. We market and sell the BVS system in
Europe under a CE mark and in 2001 we received regulatory approval to market
and sell the BVS in Japan.

The AB5000 is a new heart assist product model approved for
commercial distribution during fiscal 2004. 
It incorporates a number of features to facilitate patient mobility
within the hospital, patient transport between hospitals, and improved ease of
use for caregivers.  These features
include a smaller and more mobile control console incorporating up-to-date
technology, a blood pump geometry and design that allows paracorporeal
placement, and a simpler and more intuitive user interface.  In addition, the AB5000 console is designed
to serve as a flexible and upgradeable platform for future blood pump product
enhancements to address broadened patient populations for longer periods of
support subject to regulatory approval.

The BVS and AB5000 are the only devices that the FDA has approved
for the temporary treatment of all categories of patients with failing but
potentially recoverable hearts. Both the BVS and AB5000 systems consist of the
following components:

•

Single-use external blood pumps,
which provide pumping of blood for the left, right or both sides of a patient’s
heart and are designed to emulate the function of the natural heart;

•

Cannulae, which are specially
designed tubes used to connect the blood pumps to a patient’s heart; and

•

A computer-controlled pneumatic
drive and control console, which automatically adjusts the pumping rate to meet
the basic needs of the patient.  The BVS
console can control only the BVS blood pump. 
The AB5000 console can be used to control the BVS and AB5000 blood
pumps.

The integration of the cannulae, blood pumps and console creates
an “external heart” system with the ability to reduce the load on the heart,
provide pulsatile blood flow to vital organs and allow the heart muscles time
to rest and recover. Both the BVS and the AB5000 are designed to be easy to use
and do not require a specially trained technician to constantly monitor or
adjust the pumping parameters.

These products are designed to facilitate the recovery of
patients’ hearts as quickly as possible. Historically, patients who recover
under BVS support typically stabilize in a period of less than one week. It
generally takes three to five days for the damaged but recoverable heart muscle
to restore its function in a post-cardiotomy patient. While the BVS has been
used to support some patients for weeks or months, the BVS is not intended nor
approved for long-term use. The BVS, although it is an external ventricular
assist device, serves a different function than bridge-to-transplant devices,
which are intended for long-term use by patients awaiting a heart
transplant.  In contrast, the AB5000,
while its current regulatory approval is identical to that of the BVS, is
designed to allow for longer periods of operation, and has already demonstrated
its reliability for extended periods in the test laboratory.  It is our intention to seek expanded
indications for use for the AB5000 as soon as we have accumulated the
appropriate data to support an application to the FDA.

The BVS and AB5000 are most frequently used to support patients
who have undergone open-heart surgery, when the heart cannot be successfully
restarted and weaned off the heart-lung machine used in surgery. Each can
assume the full pumping function of the heart for these patients while reducing
certain risks associated with extended support on the heart-lung machine,
including bleeding, strokes and blood cell


damage. The traditional therapy for these patients has been the
combined use of drugs and intra-aortic balloon pumps. Intra-aortic balloon
pumps are capable of providing limited enhancement to the pumping function of a
failing heart. Despite the availability of such therapy, many thousands of
these patients die each year.

Other categories of patients who can be supported by the BVS or
the AB5000 include those suffering from viral myocarditis, a viral infection of
the heart. For these patients, the devices assume the full pumping function of
the heart, allowing the patient’s immune system to defend against the virus.
Other uses include supporting patients following failed heart transplants,
supporting heart attack patients while their status and therapeutic options are
evaluated, and supporting the right ventricle of a patient’s heart in
conjunction with the implantation of a device to assist the left ventricle.

Any hospital performing open-chest heart surgery may use the BVS
or the AB5000. There are approximately 900 of these hospitals in the U.S. and
more than 1,000 such hospitals outside the U.S. As of March 31, 2004,
nearly 600 medical centers in the U.S. had purchased the BVS, including 70% of
the major U.S. centers that perform more than 500 heart surgeries annually. In
marketing the BVS, we are focusing on providing disposable blood pumps to
existing customers.  AB5000 marketing
efforts are initially focused on introducing the system in the largest
cardiothoracic surgical centers through sales of consoles and sales of blood
pumps.

The AbioCor Implantable
Replacement Heart

The AbioCor is a battery-powered totally implantable replacement
heart system. The AbioCor is referred to as totally implantable because it has
been designed to operate on portable external battery power, without wires or
any other material penetrating the patient’s skin. The AbioCor is referred to
as a replacement heart because it has been designed for implantation in the
space vacated by the removal of a patient’s diseased ventricles, where it will
take over the full pumping function of the heart. The AbioCor is intended for
use as destination therapy by patients with irreparably damaged hearts who are
at risk of imminent death but whose other vital organs remain viable.

In 1988, we began to receive directed funding for AbioCor
development and testing from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institutes,
known as the NHLBI.  We maintained this
competitively-funded support through the research phase of our AbioCor
development program by achieving various designated milestones. Cumulatively,
the NHLBI has provided over $20 million toward of the development of the
AbioCor.


Design of the AbioCor

.

The AbioCor system consists of the following principal components:

•

A thoracic unit, or “replacement
heart,” which includes two artificial ventricles with their associated valves
and a hydraulic pumping system. The unit weighs approximately two pounds and
provides complete blood circulation to the lungs and the rest of the body. The
ventricles and their associated valves have seamless surfaces made from our
blood-contacting material, Angioflex, and special geometries with flow patterns
designed to reduce the risk of blood cell damage and blood clots. Our current
configuration of the thoracic unit is sized for patients with relatively large
chest cavities. We are also developing future generation replacement hearts
sized to fit virtually all adults who might benefit from a replacement heart.

•

A rechargeable internal battery
that is implanted beneath the skin in the abdomen of AbioCor recipients and
allows the AbioCor to operate without any external power supply for limited
periods of time.

•

A microprocessor-based internal
electronic device, or “controller”, that is implanted beneath the skin in the
abdomen of AbioCor recipients and controls and monitors the thoracic unit and
provides radio communication with an external monitor affording patients and
caregivers the opportunity for real-time information on its operating status.

•

An across-the-skin, or
transcutaneous energy transmission system, which eliminates the need for wires
penetrating the patient’s skin and the inherent associated risks of infection.
It transfers the power to operate the AbioCor system and to recharge the
implantable battery without tethering the patient to an external drive console.
This system includes an internal energy coil that is implanted beneath the skin
and an external coil that is aligned in proximity to the internal coil but
resides outside the skin. The external coil emits power that is received by the
internal coil.

An external rechargeable battery
pack and monitor designed to be worn by the patient. These components supply
primary power to the system, allow patient mobility, provide system diagnostic
information, and recharge the implanted back-up battery as needed.

The AbioCor design is intended to preserve life and to restore the
quality of a patient’s life to an acceptable level.  Restoration of the quality of a patient’s life means that the
patient should be able to return to a comfortable lifestyle, free from pain,
with good mental acuity and an ability to carry out everyday


activities. Among the quality-of-life features of the AbioCor
design are quiet heart valves, no penetration of the skin, no tethering to a
large external drive console and no need for immuno-suppression therapies. The
AbioCor system is designed for both low maintenance and low patient
involvement. However, during our ongoing initial clinical trial of the first
generation AbioCor, patients have largely remained under sustained medical
supervision in the hospital and have typically used a portable monitoring
device in lieu of the less-burdensome patient-carried external battery pack and
electronics until such time as their health has recovered and a greater degree
of independence has been demonstrated.

We have also created tools and methods intended to make the
AbioCor system easier to implant. These tools include quick-connectors for
attachment of the AbioCor to the human anatomy and a virtual surgery software
tool to allow for the simulated implant of the AbioCor into a three-dimensional
anatomical computerized model of a particular patient prior to opening that
patient’s chest.

Initial Clinical Trial

. In our initial clinical trial we
are seeking to determine whether the first generation AbioCor can effectively
and safely extend life with acceptable quality of life for patients who are
otherwise likely to die within thirty days and who have no other life-saving
option. The results of this initial fifteen patient trial will allow us to
better assess our status with regard to obtaining regulatory approval to
commercially market and sell the AbioCor for an initial subset of patients in
the U.S.

In January 2001, we received FDA permission under an
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to begin the initial human clinical
trial. Under the terms of the IDE, our initial trial consists of a total of
fifteen patients divided into three groups of five each, with expansion to each
successive group of five patients if the 60-day experience of patients with the
first generation AbioCor is satisfactory to the FDA. Patients can be included
in this initial clinical trial only if they have biventricular heart failure,
are more than eighteen years old, are unresponsive to any other existing
therapies, are ineligible for heart transplantation and are sufficiently large
for the first generation AbioCor to fit and operate adequately.  Patients are to be excluded from the
clinical trial if their heart failure has a significant potential of being
reversible, if they do not have a high likelihood of dying within the next 30
days, if they are pregnant, have serious psychiatric illness or an inadequate
social support system.  Patients may
also be excluded if they are suffering from other serious non-cardiac medical
ailments.

As
of May 26, 2004, 14 patients have been enrolled in the initial AbioCor clinical
trial.  Twelve of those patients have
been supported for some period of time, and 2 died just subsequent to surgery.  Two patients implanted during the month of
May 2004 are currently alive. The duration of support for the 10 patients
supported by the AbioCor has ranged from 53 to 512 days, with an average
support duration of approximately 5 months. 
In a cumulative total of approximately 4.4 patient-years of support, the
mechanical operation of the first generation AbioCor system has been highly
reliable, providing appropriate and predictable circulatory support.  One device experienced wearout of one
component after nearly 17 months of operation. 
This was within the predicted range of durability for the current first
generation device, and the process was tracked by the clinical team and by
ABIOMED’s engineers, who were able to offer the patient an opportunity, which
was declined, for a replacement AbioCor. 
We are not aware of any other clinically significant AbioCor
malfunction.  None of the patients has
experienced device-related infection or sepsis.  Some patients have experienced strokes that led to withdrawal of
support.  Strokes are a continuing risk
for any circulatory support system, and may be impacted by surgical technique,
device characteristics and/or patient management.  Potential causes of the strokes continue to be monitored and addressed,
primarily through efforts to identify and facilitate optimal blood flow at the
point of surgical attachment of the AbioCor to the atria of the natural heart.
Adequate anticoagulation management has been a challenge for all but one of
these sickest of heart failure patients.

Five
of 11 supported patients were ambulatory. 
Three patients had excursions outside of the hospital.  Two patients were discharged to facilities
near the hospitals an intermediate step toward final discharge to home.  These patients were able to go to
restaurants, attend shows, sporting events, and religious services, and visit
with family and friends.  Such
activities have been conducted mostly with wearable external components
allowing for freedom and mobility.  One
patient was discharged home.


Success of the initial clinical trial will be evaluated based upon
periodic review of the survival of AbioCor patients and their quality of life
as measured periodically by a variety of assessment criteria. It will also be evaluated
according to the frequency and severity of adverse events, such as
strokes.  As we gain clinical experience
with the most seriously ill patients and demonstrate clinical efficacy and
safety, we expect to enhance the performance range, durability and reliability
of AbioCor systems and plan to seek regulatory approval for current and
subsequent generations of the AbioCor for use in imminently dying patients and
in increasingly broad patient populations and with longer intended durations.
Such regulatory approvals will likely require clinical data and trials beyond
this initial trial. This regulatory plan is consistent with our experience with
the BVS system.

While the AbioCor is designed as a permanent replacement for the
failing heart, the AbioCor as it exists today is a first generation device that
will likely require improvement over time to incorporate feedback from its
clinical use. The patients who will be initially treated with the AbioCor will
be relatively large framed adults who are near death and for whom the AbioCor
represents the only potential viable alternative to death. We have tested the
AbioCor extensively. The results of such testing were part of our IDE
submission to the FDA from which we gained permission to commence initial clinical
trials. We believe that for patients ill enough to qualify for the initial
clinical trial, the first generation AbioCor presents the best alternative to
potentially extend their lives and to provide them with an acceptable quality
of life. However, we understand that this patient category represents only a
fraction of the potential patients who might benefit annually from the AbioCor.
Our clinical and regulatory strategy of continuing to improve the AbioCor based
on clinical experience is intended to allow us to demonstrate that the AbioCor
can provide patients with a reasonable quality of life for sustained periods of
time. We believe that demonstration of this capability is needed for eventual
use of the product in end-stage heart failure patients who are not as ill as is
required to qualify for our initial clinical trial.

Cost Effectiveness

. We are developing the AbioCor
with the intent to eventually offer a cost-effective treatment for end-stage
heart failure patients. In addition, the AbioCor has the potential to allow
patients an opportunity to return to productive lives. This would allow the
medical system to save money by discharging the patient from the hospital and
allowing the person to become productive and lead a reasonably normal life.

If the safety, effectiveness and durability of the AbioCor are
clinically demonstrated for multiple-year durations, it has the potential to be
less expensive than heart transplantation over a five-year period. One reason
for this reduced cost is that recipients of a mechanical replacement heart are
not expected to need immuno-suppression drugs. The blood and tissue contacting
portions of the AbioCor are constructed of inert materials, which are not
expected to elicit a response from a patient’s immune system. Other cost
savings could result because the patients can receive a replacement heart
sooner and would not require extensive tests and biopsies to assess donor heart
compatibility. While recipients of the AbioCor will need to purchase new
batteries periodically, we anticipate that the annual comparative cost of
battery purchases will be significantly less than the cost of
immuno-suppression drugs required by donor heart recipients.  AbioCor patients do require common and
relatively inexpensive anticoagulation drugs on an ongoing basis

While developing the AbioCor, we introduced the BVS, a temporary
heart-assist device, which is currently being sold in the U.S. and
international markets, and more recently the AB5000. Certain key elements of
the technology developed for the AbioCor, especially the blood contacting
material, Angioflex, have been clinically tested and are currently in
commercial use in these heart assist products. 
The AbioCor blood pumping technology developed and refined over more
than two decades has found a commercial application in the AB5000
Ventricle.  In addition, our heart
assist business has enabled us to develop significant experience in areas such
as research and development, manufacturing, regulatory compliance, clinical
support and sales and marketing. We believe our experience in these areas will
provide us with a competitive advantage in commercializing the AbioCor.

Ongoing Development

.

The AbioCor is subject to ongoing
development and refinements.  The first
generation AbioCor does not yet meet our longer-term goal of five years of
operational reliability. In the


United States its current size fits less than 50% of adult males
and less than 18% of adult females. 
External elements of the system are subject to ongoing refinement to
improve ease of use for clinicians and quality of life for patients and their
families.  The experience being gained
in the initial AbioCor clinical trial is invaluable in guiding these ongoing
development efforts.

Our development of the smaller second generation AbioCor II has
entered the animal testing phase.  The
AbioCor II incorporates features of both the first generation AbioCor and the
Penn State Heart. We acquired the technology rights to the Penn State Heart in
2000.  Similar to the AbioCor, the
development of the Penn State Heart was supported by significant funding from
the NHLBI.  The AbioCor and the Penn
State Heart were the only two replacement heart programs that achieved the
technological progress needed to qualify for the final pre-clinical rounds of
funding from the NHLBI.

Other Products and
Technologies

We are using the technology and know-how derived from the AbioCor,
BVS and AB5000 in the research and development of other potential
cardiovascular products. We are also using our experience and commitment to
this field to evaluate potential collaborative arrangements relating to
third-party technologies and products.

Other new technologies are in various stages of research, development
or evaluation, and include passive and active heart wraps as well as
specialized implantable and external heart assist devices. Some are
technologies developed earlier and placed on hold, such as an advanced
intra-aortic balloon pump, the SupraCor. 
In addition, research and development activities under our product
development programs incorporate certain technologies that have potential as
separate spin-off products. Examples include implantable monitoring systems
with remote transmission capability software for virtual surgery, non-invasive
power transmission systems, and external monitoring systems.

Research and Product
Development

As of April 30, 2004, our research and development staff
consisted of 76 professional and technical personnel, including 16 individuals
in design assurance and a total of 21 engineers, many with advanced degrees,
covering disciplines such as electronics, mechanics, software, reliability
engineering, fluid mechanics, physics, materials and physiology.

Our research and development efforts are focused on mechanical
heart assist and heart replacement, and the continued enhancement of our
product offerings. Interaction continues with the FDA and corresponding foreign
regulatory agencies to obtain the necessary clearances and approvals for our
products. Sophisticated but established tools, such as three-dimensional
computer-aided design systems are used to permit smooth transition of new
designs from research to product development and into manufacturing. We have
substantial expertise in electro-mechanical systems, cardiac physiology and
experimental surgery, blood-material interactions, fluid mechanics and
hemodynamics, internal and external electronic hardware, battery technology,
software and plastics processing. Our expertise has been primarily focused on
addressing challenges associated with the safe and effective pumping of blood.

We expended $27.1 million, $20.6 million and $14.3 million on
research and development in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.  Since our inception, U.S. government
agencies, particularly the NHLBI, have provided significant support to our
product development efforts when such products are in their early stages of
research and development. As of March 31, 2004, our total backlog of research
and development contracts and grants was $0.3 million. All of these contracts
and grants contain provisions making them terminable at the convenience of the
government.


Sales, Clinical Support,
Marketing and Field Service

We believe that the sales, clinical support, marketing and field
service teams established for our heart assist product line and the
relationships developed with existing customers will be instrumental not only
in continuing to expand BVS and AB5000 usage and sales, but also in launching
heart replacement products such as the AbioCor and the AbioCor II.

The BVS and AB5000 are sold in the U.S. through direct sales and
clinical support teams. As of April 30, 2004, our worldwide sales, clinical
support, marketing and field service teams included 34 full-time employees. Our
sales force primarily focuses on increasing sales from expanded usage of
disposable blood pumps by our large installed base of customers as well as from
initial and upgrade sales to new and existing customers. Our clinical support
group focuses on training and educating new and existing customers in order to
help improve clinical outcomes. We believe that the efforts of our clinical
support group contribute significantly to the number of lives saved by
physicians using our products. This in turn promotes usage and reorders of BVS
and AB5000 single-use blood pumps. We believe that the reputation and customer
relationships of our sales and support teams will be key assets for the
introduction of future products such as the AbioCor, additional heart assist
product line extensions, and other products under development.

Building on our experience in the U.S., in recent years we have
expanded our international sales efforts for our heart assist products and in
preparation for the AbioCor. In October 2001 we received approval from the
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to market and sell the BVS
system in Japan. We conduct our international sales efforts through distributors
and by selling directly in selected European markets through ABIOMED B.V., our
wholly-owned subsidiary located in The Netherlands.  It is our intention to expand our international market presence
through distributorships in Canada and Latin America.

Manufacturing

We have over 10 years of experience in the manufacture of
mechanical circulatory support consoles, blood pumps, cannulae and related
accessories.  The manufacture of our BVS
and AB5000 blood pumps and consoles, and the pilot manufacturing of our AbioCor
system components, includes assembly, testing and quality control. All of the
AbioCor systems manufactured are being used for our ongoing initial clinical
trial, testing and other investigational purposes. None of the AbioCor systems
manufactured are currently available or approved for commercial sale.  Key blood-contacting components for the
blood pumps, including valves and bladders, are manufactured from our
proprietary Angioflex polymer. The production of the AbioCor is based on some
processes that are similar to the processes used for the BVS. We produce the
majority of the AbioCor blood contacting components in our facility and all
such components are assembled in-house. A majority of the metallic mechanical
parts and batteries used to produce the AbioCor are contract-manufactured or
purchased.  We contract with third
parties to manufacture our AB5000 and AbioCor consoles. Depending on the size
and design of cannulae, they are either purchased or manufactured by us.

As of April 30, 2004, a total of 60 employees were engaged in
BVS and AB5000 manufacturing and AbioCor pilot manufacturing.  Manufacturing and pilot manufacturing
operations are further supported by an additional 14 people devoted to quality
assurance and documentation and by 16 people in materials management and
purchasing.

We believe our existing facility gives us the physical capacity to
produce sufficient quantities of AbioCor systems throughout the period of our
clinical trials as well as sufficient quantities of BVS and AB5000 disposable
blood pumps and cannulae to meet market demand for the foreseeable future. Our
BVS and AB5000 manufacturing area is ISO 13485 certified and operates under the
FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the current quality
system regulations, known as QSR. Our AbioCor manufacturing areas are ISO 13485
certified, and we are taking steps towards ensuring that our AbioCor
manufacturing area will be QSR compliant for purposes of eventual commercial
distribution of AbioCor, subject to regulatory approvals.  Raw material for processing of Angioflex, a
material critical to our products,


is purchased from a single source, and the company typically
maintains inventory to last in excess of five years.

Proprietary Rights,
Patents and Know-How

We have developed significant know-how and proprietary technology,
upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary
technology, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
confidentiality agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only
limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent
proprietary information, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology
without our approval.

A substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating
to the AbioCor, the Penn State Heart, the BVS and the AB5000 is in the form of
trade secrets, rather than patents. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary
knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees,
consultants and other parties. We cannot assure that our trade secrets will not
become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.

As
of May 15, 2004, we own 57 U.S. patents, including 17 related to the AbioCor,
10 related to the AbioCor II (Penn State Heart), and two related to the BVS.
These patents have expiration dates ranging from June 21, 2005, to
September 30, 2023.  We also own a
number of corresponding patents in a limited number of foreign countries. Our
patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. They may also be
challenged by third parties. Our pending or future patent applications may not
be approved. The patents of others may render our patents obsolete or otherwise
have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Because foreign
patents may afford less protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately
protect our proprietary information.

The medical device industry is characterized by a large number of
patents and by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation. Our
products and technologies could infringe on the proprietary rights of third
parties. If third parties successfully assert infringement or other claims against
us, we may not be able to sell our products. In addition, patent or
intellectual property disputes or litigation may be costly, result in product
development delays, or divert the efforts and attention of our management and
technical personnel. If any such disputes or litigation arise, we may seek to
enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement. However, such an arrangement may
not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. We may decide, in
the alternative, to litigate the claims or to design around the patented or
otherwise proprietary technology.

The government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose
technical data developed under government contracts that supported the
development of some of our products. We retain the right to obtain patents on
any inventions developed under those contracts (subject to a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, royalty-free license to the government), provided we follow
prescribed procedures.

Competition

Competition among providers of treatments for the failing heart is
intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry
requirements and standards. Many of the companies developing or marketing
cardiovascular products have substantially greater or broader financial,
product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than ABIOMED.
These competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality
at the same or lower prices. Moreover, improvements in current or new
technologies may make them technically equivalent or superior to our products
in addition to providing cost or other advantages. Other advances in medical
technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the
potential markets for our products or render those products obsolete.

No fully implantable replacement heart is commercially available
today. We are aware of other heart replacement device research efforts in the
U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan, but are not aware of any plans for


any other totally implantable replacement heart to commence
clinical trials in the U.S. or anywhere in the world. In March 2004, the
FDA’s Circulatory Systems Devices Panel recommended approval of Syncardia
Systems’ CardioWest Total Artificial Heart for use as a bridge to
transplantation in cardiac transplant-eligible candidates at risk of imminent
death from non-reversable biventricular failure.  As of May 26, 2004 the FDA had not yet acted on that recommendation.  Unlike our AbioCor, the CardioWest heart is
not fully implantable and is not conducive to discharge of patients from the
hospital.  For those reasons, we do not
view it as a competitor to the AbioCor. 
We believe that if and when other implantable replacement hearts are
available, our AbioCor will compete with them based on quality-of-life
advantages, cost effectiveness, device reliability, clinical support and
customer relationships.

In addition to the developers of implantable replacement hearts,
there are a number of companies, including Arrow International, Thoratec
Corporation and World Heart Corporation which are developing permanent heart
assist products, including implantable LVADs and miniaturized rotary
ventricular assist devices, that may address markets that overlap with certain segments
of the markets targeted by ABIOMED’s products. We believe that implantable
replacement hearts, LVADs and other VADs, if developed and proven effective for
destination therapy, will generally be used to address the needs of different
patient populations, with an overlap for certain segments of the heart failure
population. We believe that there is a need for both implantable LVADs and
implantable replacement hearts as destination therapies, and that when both
technologies demonstrate the required reliability, surgeons will make decisions
based upon the specific needs and conditions of individual patients.

In addition to devices being developed for patients in need of
heart replacement, several companies and institutions have been for many years
investigating xenotransplantation, the transplantation of a heart from another
species, as a potential therapy. Most notably, some developers are
investigating the use of genetically engineered pig hearts as an alternative
source of donor hearts. This technology remains in its formative stage and
subject to a number of significant challenges, including controlling elevated
immunologic reactions leading to heightened rejection problems between
cross-species grafting and major concerns for cross-species disease transmission
to the recipient and the public at large. We believe that this technology
remains in the research phase.

Research is also being conducted to develop gene
and cell therapy as potential to reverse the disease process or to supplant
diseased heart cells.  We believe that
these research activities, while promising, remain in the formative stage.

The BVS and AB5000 systems can assume the full pumping function of
the heart. The FDA approved these systems as bridge-to-recovery devices for the
treatment of all patients with potentially reversible heart failure. They
compete with a temporary cardiac assist device from Thoratec Corporation, which
is also capable of assuming the full pumping function of the heart and is today
approved for post-cardiotomy support. The Thoratec device was originally
approved for bridge-to-transplant and bridge-to-transplant continues to be the
primary use of the device. In addition, the BVS and AB5000 compete with blood
pumps, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps and centrifugal pumps, that are used
in medical centers for a variety of applications but which are limited to
either providing partial pumping support of failing hearts, or are
non-pulsatile, or are not recommended for the duration of support generally
required for bridge-to-recovery. We are aware of one other company that is
conducting clinical trials in the U.S. with a device that may compete with our
current heart assist products. Approval by the FDA of products that compete
directly with our products could increase competitive pricing and other
pressures. We believe that we can compete with such products based on cost,
clinical utility and customer relations.

Our customers frequently have limited budgets. As a result, our
products compete against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies
for these limited funds. Our success will depend in large part upon our ability
to enhance our existing products, to develop new products to meet regulatory
and customer requirements, and to achieve market acceptance. We believe that
important competitive factors with respect to the development and
commercialization of our products include the relative speed with which we can
develop products, establish clinical utility, complete clinical trials and
regulatory approval processes, obtain reimbursement, and supply commercial
quantities of the product to the market.


Third-Party Reimbursement

We sell our current products and intend to sell most of our
potential products under development to medical institutions. Medical
institutions and their physicians typically seek reimbursement for the use of
these products from third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and
private health insurers and managed care organizations. As a result, market
acceptance of our current and proposed products may depend in large part on the
extent to which reimbursement is available to medical institutions and
physicians for use of our products.

Coverage and the level of payment provided by U.S. and foreign
third-party payers varies according to a number of factors, including the
medical procedure, payer, location, outcome and cost. In the U.S., many private
health care insurance carriers follow the lead of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS), which establishes guidelines for the coverage of
procedures, services and medical equipment and the payment of health care
providers treating Medicare patients. Internationally, healthcare reimbursement
systems vary significantly. In certain countries, medical center budgets are
fixed regardless of levels of patient treatment. In other countries, such as
Japan, reimbursement from government or third party payers must be applied for
and approved. The amount that Medicare pays a medical institution for
in-patient care of Medicare patients is based on the Diagnosis Related Group
(DRG) to which a specific hospitalization is assigned for payment purposes,
without regard to the actual costs of the specific hospitalization.  Physicians bill separately for the
procedures that they perform. Effective October 1, 2002, the U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services created a new DRG (DRG 525) for
hospital discharges involving implantation of external or implantable advanced
mechanical cardiac assist devices. This action increased Medicare program
reimbursement to hospitals for patient cases involving the BVS by approximately
40-60% over prior levels.  Certain
private health insurers and managed care providers provide incremental
reimbursement to both the medical institutions and their physicians.

No reimbursement levels have been established for our products
under development, including the AbioCor. Prior to approving coverage for new
medical devices in the U.S., most third-party payers require evidence that the
product has received FDA approval or clearance for marketing, is safe and
effective and not experimental or investigational, and is medically necessary
and appropriate for the specific patient for whom the product is being used.
Increasing numbers of third-party payers require evidence that the procedures
in which the products are used, as well as the products themselves, are
cost-effective. Heart transplantation currently qualifies for reimbursement, as
does bridge-to-transplant treatment with implantable VADs. Comparatively, we
believe that when the AbioCor product reaches maturity, it should cost less
over a five-year period than heart transplantation today. We believe that these
factors should benefit the AbioCor when our customers begin to seek
reimbursement for it from third-party payers. However, we cannot assure that
the AbioCor or our other products under development will meet the criteria for
coverage and reimbursement or that third-party payers will reimburse physicians
and medical institutions at levels sufficient to encourage the widespread use
of the products.

Government Regulation

Clinical trials, manufacture and sale of our products and products
under development, including the BVS, AB5000, AbioCor and AbioCor II are, or
will be, subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign
regulatory agencies. Noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can
result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or
seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the
government to grant marketing approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing
approvals, and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request
repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or
distributed by ABIOMED.

U.S.
Clinical Use Regulations

. Our BVS and AB5000 heart assist systems are classified as Class
III medical devices under FDA rules, as is the AbioCor. In the U.S., medical
devices are classified into one of three classes (i.e., Class I, II or III)
based on the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their
safety and effectiveness. Class III medical devices are subject to the most
rigorous regulation. Class III


devices, which are typically life-sustaining, life-supporting or
implantable devices, or new devices that have been found not to be
substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices, must generally receive
pre-market approval (PMA) by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness.
Class III devices are also subject to some of the requirements applicable to
Class I and Class II devices, including general controls, such as labeling,
pre-market notification, performance standards, post-market surveillance,
patient registries and adherence to QSR requirements, which include testing,
control and documentation requirements.

A PMA application is the most common route to obtain permission to
market and sell a Class III device in the U.S. for a particular
indication.  A PMA application must be
supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically includes extensive
information including relevant bench tests, laboratory and animal studies and
clinical trial data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device.
The PMA application also must contain a complete description of the device and
its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls
used to manufacture the device, and the proposed labeling, advertising
literature and training materials. By regulation, the FDA has 180 days to
review the PMA application, and during that time an advisory committee may
evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. Advisory
committee reviews often occur over a significantly protracted period, and a
number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought have never been
cleared for marketing. In addition, modifications to a device that is the
subject of an approved PMA, or to its labeling or manufacturing process, may
require the submission of PMA supplements or new PMAs and approval by the FDA.

The FDA also provides that certain devices can be distributed
under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) rather than a PMA. In order for a
device to be eligible for an HDE, a qualifying target patient population of
less than 4,000 patients per year for which there is currently no other
available therapy must be approved by the FDA. 
The FDA’s approval of an HDE to treat that qualifying patient population
then requires demonstration that the device is safe for its intended
application, that it is potentially effective, and that the probable benefits
outweigh the associated risks.  Adoption
of an HDE device within an institution is subject to Institutional Review Board
(“IRB”) approval.  The regulatory hurdle
for an HDE, while far from negligible, is therefore significantly less
burdensome than that for a PMA.  A
device distributed under an HDE may be sold, but compensation may not exceed
recovery of costs, including cumulative research and development costs as well
as the costs of manufacturing and distribution.

If clinical trials of a device are required in order to obtain FDA
approval, the sponsor of the trial is required to file an Investigational
Device Exemption, known as an IDE, application prior to commencing clinical
trials. The IDE application must be supported by data, which typically include
the results of extensive device bench testing, animal testing performed in
conformance with Good Laboratory Practices and formal laboratory testing and
documentation in accordance with appropriate design controls and scientific
justification. If the FDA approves the IDE application, and the IRB at the
institutions at which the clinical trials will be performed approve the
clinical protocol and related materials, clinical trials may begin at a
specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as
approved by the FDA. Sponsors of clinical trials are permitted to charge for
investigational devices distributed in the course of the study provided that
compensation does not exceed recovery of the costs of manufacture, research,
development and handling. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved
by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the
investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights,
safety or welfare of human subjects.

In November 1992, the FDA approved our PMA for the BVS. In
1996 and 1997, the FDA approved the use of the BVS for additional indications,
expanding its use to the treatment of all patients with potentially reversible
heart failure. In April 2003 the AB5000 Circulatory Support System Console
was approved under a PMA Supplement, and in September 2003 a PMA supplement
for the AB5000 blood pump was approved.

The AbioCor is classified as a Class III device and therefore is
subject to the IDE and PMA processes and QSR requirements. In
January 2001, the FDA granted an IDE providing us with regulatory
permission to commence the initial clinical trial of the AbioCor. The initial
clinical trial, which began on July 3, 2001, is


subject to periodic review and to the readiness of each
collaborating medical center, including training of its surgical and
post-operative care teams and approval of the clinical trial protocol by the
hospital’s IRB. Our clinical trial is being undertaken with patients who,
despite all available therapies, have an extremely high probability of death
within thirty days due to heart failure.

We anticipate seeking initial FDA approval of the AbioCor for a
limited category of indications and patients through an HDE, and subsequent
approval via PMA for additional indications and patient populations. After the
initial regulatory approval, we will need to complete additional clinical
testing and request supplemental approvals for additional indications and
broader marketing claims. If we obtain approval of the AbioCor in this manner,
the FDA may initially impose restrictions on use of the AbioCor. Nevertheless,
we believe that this phased approach will permit us to obtain initial marketing
approval for the AbioCor more quickly than if we were to seek a broader
approval from the outset.

U.S.
Manufacturing and Sales Regulation

. Any devices, including the BVS, which we manufacture or
distribute pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals, are subject to continuing
regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Manufacturers of
medical devices for marketing in the U.S. are required to adhere to QSR
requirements and must also comply with Medical Devices Reporting, or MDR, which
requires that a firm report to the FDA any incident in which its product may
have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which its
product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it would be likely
to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling and promotional
activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by
the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the
marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. We are subject to
routine inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance
with QSR and MDR requirements, as well as other applicable regulations.

International
Regulation

.
We are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which we
sell our products. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these
counties are similar to those of the FDA. 
We believe that foreign regulations relating to the manufacture and sale
of medical devices are becoming more stringent. The European Union requires
that medical devices such as the BVS and AB5000 comply with the Medical Device
Directive, which includes quality system and CE certification
requirements.  The BVS and the AB5000
comply with the Medical Devices Directive, are CE marked and available for sale
in the European Union.  We have obtained
the requisite regulatory approvals for sale of the BVS in other foreign
countries, as well. In the European Union, implantable devices, such as the
AbioCor, must comply with the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive,
known as AIMDD, which includes quality system requirements, in order to obtain
CE certification.  The scope of our
quality system specifically includes the design, development, and manufacture
of cardiac replacement systems, but obtaining CE certification under the AIMDD
for the AbioCor or other implantable products under development may be difficult,
costly and time-consuming.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

All statements, trend analysis and other information
contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and
trends in sales, gross profit and anticipated expense levels, as well as other
statements, including words such as “may,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,”
“estimate,” “expect,” and “intend” and other similar expressions constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to
business and economic risks and uncertainties, and our actual results of
operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, those discussed below under “Risk Factors” as well as
other risks and uncertainties referenced in this Report.

Overview

We are a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical
products designed to safely and effectively assist or replace the pumping
function of the failing heart. In July 2001, in collaboration with leading
medical centers, we commenced initial clinical trials for the world’s first implantable,
battery-powered replacement heart, the AbioCor. The AbioCor, which is intended
for end-stage heart failure patients, is designed to replace the failing
ventricles of a patient’s diseased heart and take over their pumping function.
The commencement of this initial clinical trial, approved by the FDA under an
IDE, followed nearly three decades of research, development and testing related
to this technology.  The initial AbioCor
clinical trial has entered its final stage, and we have announced our intention
to achieve initial commercial introduction of the AbioCor under a Humanitarian
Device Exemption from the FDA at the earliest possible time.

We currently manufacture and sell two models of our temporary
heart assist product.  The BVS 5000
Biventricular Support System was the first device approved by the FDA as a
bridge-to-recovery device for temporary treatment of all patients with failing
but potentially recoverable hearts.  The
BVS system has an installed base of approximately 900 consoles located in
approximately 600 medical centers in the United States, including 70% of all
medical centers that perform more than 500 heart surgeries annually.  The BVS system has also been placed in more
than 100 medical centers outside the United States, primarily in Europe.  Our AB5000 Circulatory Support System is a
new heart assist product model, designed to provide enhanced patient mobility
within and between centers, to facilitate patient ambulation, and to provide
enhanced features and ease of use for caregivers.  In April 2003, we introduced the AB5000 console, a new
console that will serve as a platform for ongoing and future blood pump product
line enhancements to meet patient needs across a broader spectrum of temporary
heart assist applications.  In September 2003
we received FDA approval to market the AB5000 Ventricle, the first of these new
blood pumps.  The AB5000 system was the
subject of a carefully controlled clinical introduction until its formal
commercial launch in April 2004.

The BVS and AB5000 systems each consist of single-use external
blood pumps and cannulae and a reusable pneumatic drive and control
console.  Both are capable of assuming
the full pumping function of a patient’s failing heart, and are designed to
provide either univentricular or biventricular support.  Both are currently approved by the FDA for
temporary use while the patient’s heart is allowed to rest, heal and
recover.  The AB5000 console is capable
of controlling both the BVS and the AB5000 blood pumps, and incorporates upgradeable
software features to accommodate future product line enhancements, while the
BVS console supports only the BVS blood pump. 
It is our intent to seek expansion of the current approved indications
for use of the AB5000 in order to allow support of expanded patient populations
for longer periods of support.

Our heart assist product revenues consist of sales of consoles and
blood pumps to new customers and reorders of blood pumps from existing
customers. Following commercial introduction of the BVS in the U.S. in 1992,
our focus was on obtaining market share beginning with the largest medical
centers.   Similarly, our focus with the
AB5000 will be to establish the new model in the largest medical centers
performing the highest number of open-heart surgical procedures first and then
to build the installed base of consoles to other centers.  Our early experience indicates that many of
our established customers, as well as centers that have


not previously been our customers, will want to acquire the AB5000
console in order to gain access to its features and to be able to use the new
AB5000 ventricle.  We do not anticipate
significant future sales of BVS consoles in the United States, but we do expect
that there will be a continuing demand for BVS blood pumps.  We will continue to seek increased usage and
product reorders by existing customers for both the BVS and the AB5000 blood
pumps.

Research and development is a significant portion of our
operations.  Our research and
development efforts are focused on the development of new products related to
heart assist and heart replacement, and the continued enhancement of current
technologies.  One such effort is the
AbioCor II, a smaller replacement heart incorporating a pumping mechanism
different from that of the AbioCor. Our operating results reflect the dual
activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and
development of new technologies.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition
and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our
estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, bad debts,
warranty obligations, inventory valuations and income taxes. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

. We
follow the guidance of

SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB 104”) regarding the recognition,
presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements.  SAB 104 establishes the SEC’s view that it
is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are
met:  (1) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (4)
collectibility is reasonably assured.  
Further, SAB 104 requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership
be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized.  We believe that our revenue recognition
policies are in compliance with SAB 104.

We derive our revenues from two principal
sources:  (1) product sales, including
maintenance service agreements, and (2) funded research and development
contracts and grants from government and other third party sources.  The great majority of our product revenues
are derived from our shipment of BVS and AB5000 products to fulfill customer
orders for a specified number of consoles and/or blood pumps for a specified
price. We recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon
product shipment.

As described below, some of our older BVS
extended-term contracts require us to estimate the revenue to be recognized on
each blood pump shipped as a result of judgments made regarding the potential
number of pumps to be shipped over the duration of the individual contracts.
Revenue from government contracts and grants is subject to government audit
adjustment. As a result, we defer a portion of our government contract and
grant revenue based upon our estimate of potential exposure to such
adjustments.

During the three years
ending March 31, 2004, a declining percentage of our BVS product revenue
was derived from extended-term contracts with certain of our customers, which
contracts provide the customers with units of our BVS product under contract
terms of one-to-three years.  These
contracts provide for the Company to receive a fixed, non-refundable amount of
money over a set period of time in return for our providing these customers
with BVS product at the start of the contract and restocking the customer with
BVS blood pumps during the term of the contract. The exact quantity of such
additional pumps to be supplied, if any, is limited to the actual usage by the
customer to support their patients. We recognize revenue, and record related
cost of product revenues, ratably over the term of the contract using an
estimated per unit selling price based upon actual shipments of pumps to
customers compared to the maximum number of additional pumps allowable under
the contract.  When a maximum number is
not specified in the sales


contract, we compare
actual shipments to our estimate of additional pumps that might be required by
the customer. In the majority of contracts that contain contractual limits on
the number of pumps, customers do not use the maximum number of allowable pumps
and, as a result, we recognize the remaining deferred revenue at the end of the
contract term with no associated incremental cost at that time. For a small
number of older contracts that reached termination in fiscal 2004 and that did
not have a contractual maximum number of pumps upon which to rely, we estimated
customer blood pump usage and the resulting per unit selling price based upon
historical experience.

Cash received in advance of revenue in connection with the sale of
blood pumps under extended-term contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and
is classified as a current or long-term liability depending on the expected
shipment dates of the blood pumps.

Maintenance service revenues are recognized ratably over the term
of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract.

Government-sponsored research and development contracts and grants
generally provide for payment on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. Revenues from
these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed, provided the
government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work. Under contracts in
which the Company elects to spend significantly more on the development project
during the term of the contract than the total contract amount, the Company
prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the
contract as it incurs related research and development costs, provided the
government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our
customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our
historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have
identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our
expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will
continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. If
the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an
impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.

Warranties

. Our products are subject to
rigorous regulation and quality standards. While we engage in extensive product
quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the quality
of component suppliers, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure
rates and product recalls. Our operating results could be adversely affected if
the actual cost of product failures, including product recalls, exceeds our
estimated warranty provision.

Inventories

. 
We value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or
current estimated market value.  We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down to
its net realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired.  If actual demand or market conditions are less
favorable than projected demand, additional inventory write-downs may be
required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which
the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified.  The inventory balances at March 31,
2003 and March 31, 2004 are net of impairment write-downs of $722,000 and
$1,119,000, respectively.  All of our inventories are related to our
heart assist product line. We will not capitalize any costs related to AbioCor
inventory until we receive regulatory approval to begin commercial sales;
currently anticipated for late in calendar 2005.

Income
Taxes

. As
part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are
required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together
with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of
items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax
assets and liabilities. In addition, as of March 31, 2004, the Company had
federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $61.1 million
that begin to expire in 2005. The Company also has research and development
credit carryforwards of approximately $4.5 million that begin to expire in
2006. We have


recorded a valuation allowance of $30.2 million as an offset
against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the
uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit. In
the event that we determine in the future that the Company will be able to
realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit, an adjustment to
deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a
determination was made.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of
operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues
(which includes revenues from products and funded research and development):

Fiscal Years Ended
March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003 (“fiscal 2004” and “fiscal 2003”)

Product Revenues.

Product revenues increased by $2.0
million, or 8%, from  $23.1 million in
fiscal 2003 to $25.1 million in fiscal 2004. The increase is attributable to
sales of AB5000 consoles and ventricles during the controlled clinical rollout
that began in the first fiscal quarter for the console and in the second fiscal
quarter for the ventricle.  Product
revenue reflects fulfillment of all of the sales backlog reported at the end of
our third fiscal quarter.  Going
forward, we expect total revenue growth in excess of 10% annually driven by
sales of AB5000 consoles and ventricles subsequent to the full product rollout
in April 2004.  Revenue growth may
be concentrated in the second half of our current fiscal year (fiscal 2005). We
also expect that the BVS will remain an important part of our heart assist
product portfolio, as we anticipate continuing demand for BVS blood pumps.

Domestic sales accounted for 92% of total product revenue during
fiscal 2004 and 94% of product revenue for fiscal 2003.

Funded
Research and Development Revenues.

Contract revenues
increased by $0.5 million to $0.7 million in fiscal 2004 from $0.2 million in
fiscal 2003.  As of March 31, 2004,
our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was $0.3
million. All of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them
terminable at the convenience of the government.

Cost
of Product Revenues.

Cost of product revenues
as a percentage of product revenues improved to 30% for fiscal 2004 from 32% in
fiscal 2003.  The improvement in margin
is primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs, increased sales as a
result of the introduction of the new AB5000 system, and a write-down of
inventory of an older model of the BVS console to its net realizable value in
the prior year.  We


expect that the growth of AB5000 product revenues will support
continued margin improvement in future reporting periods.

Research
and Development Expenses

.  Research and
development expenses decreased by $6.3 million, or 30%, from $20.6 million in
fiscal 2003 to $14.3 million in fiscal 2004. 
Research and development expenses were 88% of total revenues for fiscal
2003 and 56% of total revenues in fiscal 2004. The largest portion of this
decrease is attributable to research and development expenses incurred for the
AbioCor, which decreased by $5.3 million from $15.0 million for fiscal 2003 to
$9.7 million during fiscal 2004. These AbioCor reductions are primarily due to
labor and material purchases related to manufacture of AbioCor units as well as
development and testing activities. These reductions result from our heavier
investment in earlier years in order to achieve the current stage of our
AbioCor clinical trial. Research
and development expense for fiscal 2004 also included costs associated
with ongoing development of the AB5000, including costs associated with efforts
to obtain regulatory approval for our new AB5000 ventricle as well as those
associated with future heart assist blood pumps and cannulae that are expected
to operate with the new AB5000 platform. 
Also included in research and development expense during fiscal 2004 are
lesser costs associated with continued development and testing of the AbioCor
II.  We anticipate that the majority of
our near-term research and development focus will be on further extending the
AB5000 product line, completing the initial AbioCor clinical trial and securing
approval of a humanitarian device exemption for initial commercial introduction
of the AbioCor, and developing the AbioCor II.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6
million, or 4%, from $14.7 million in the prior year to $14.1 million in fiscal
year ended March 31, 2004.  This
reduction is attributable to lower accounting and legal costs as well as
reductions in selling and clinical support costs.  As we plan to increase both sales and clinical support staffing
in order to support the ongoing rollout of the AB5000 product, selling and
clinical support costs are likely to increase going forward.

Throughout fiscal 2004 we incurred certain expenses associated
with business development activities, primarily related to the review of
business opportunities related to rotary blood pump technologies.  These activities may continue in the coming
year and beyond, and may be expanded to encompass a wider array of different
business opportunities clustered around our existing mechanical circulatory
support business.  If these activities
were to result in a major new business initiative, it is possible that we would
decide to seek new financing in order to support that initiative.

In April 2004 David M. Lederman, Ph.D., ABIOMED’s founder,
stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer and was succeeded in
those positions by Michael R. Minogue. 
Dr. Lederman remains Chairman of the Board and an employee of the
Company.  Subsequent to our fiscal year
ending March 31, 2004, ABIOMED’s management team has been strengthened by
a number of new appointments to fill existing vacancies and/or newly defined
senior management functions.  We
estimate that our one-time costs associated with recruiting and relocation of
these new personnel, much of which will be recorded during the Company's first
quarter of its fiscal year ending March 31, 2005, will approximate $750,000.

Interest
and Other Income

.
Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances,
net of expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss.  Interest and other income was $0.8 million in fiscal 2004, a
decrease of $0.5 million from $1.3 million in fiscal 2003. This decrease was
primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from lower average
interest rates and lower average fund balances available for investment.  As a result of our improving financial
performance and the continuing reduction in research and development
expenditures as the AbioCor approaches initial commercial introduction, we were
able during fiscal 2004 to move some of our cash and short term assets into
longer term instruments in order to improve future yields.  Foreign translation costs were nearly
constant year-to-year.

Net
Loss

. Net
loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was approximately $9.4
million, or $0.45 per share. This is a 48% reduction from the net loss of
approximately $18.2 million, or $0.87 per share, in the prior fiscal year. The
losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and clinical
testing costs associated with the AbioCor, the AbioCor II, the AB5000
circulatory assist system and costs of developing


other technologies and products. 
Continued reduction of our net loss is an important goal of management,
and we anticipate moving into profitability before the end of fiscal 2005.

Fiscal Years Ended
March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002 (“fiscal 2003” and “fiscal 2002”)

Product Revenues.

Product revenues decreased by $1.6
million, or 7%, from  $24.7 million in
fiscal 2002 to $23.1 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease in product revenues
is primarily attributable to a $1.2 million decrease in revenue recognized from
BVS blood pumps shipped under extended term contracts, which reflects product
shipments and the timing of deferred revenue recognized under such contracts,
and a $0.6 million decrease in international revenues from sales of our BVS
consoles.  Offsetting these decreases
was a $0.2 million increase in revenues from the sale of our BVS disposable
blood pumps to existing and new customers. 
Domestic sales accounted for 94% of total product revenue during fiscal
2003 and 92% of product revenue for fiscal 2002.

Funded
Research and Development Revenues.

Contract revenues
decreased by $2.0 million, or 92%, to $0.2 million in fiscal 2003 from $2.2
million in fiscal 2002. There were no revenues associated with the AbioCor
government development contract in the year ending March 31, 2003 as
compared to approximately $1.1 million recognized in the year ending
March 31, 2002 as the funding under that contract ended in fiscal 2002.   In addition, we had recorded $0.6 million
in revenues in the year ending March 31, 2002 related to Abiocor clinical
trial preparation of U.S. and European medical centers, and we recorded none in
the year ending March 31, 2003.

As of March 31, 2003, our total backlog of research and
development contracts and grants was $0.5 million. All of these contracts and
grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the
government.

Cost
of Product Revenues

Cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was consistent at
32% for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002.

Research
and Development Expenses

.  Research and
development expenses decreased by $6.5 million, or 24%, from $27.1 million in
fiscal 2002 to $20.6 million in fiscal 2003. 
Research and development expenses were 88% of total revenues for fiscal
2003 and 101% of total revenues in the prior year. Research and development
expenses incurred for the AbioCor decreased by $6.0 million from $21.0 million
for fiscal 2002 to $15.0 million during fiscal 2003.  Included in the AbioCor costs are costs related to continued
improvement and testing of the AbioCor, costs associated with pilot
manufacturing of the AbioCor and costs to support the AbioCor clinical trial.  The majority of the decrease in fiscal 2003
AbioCor development costs are associated with reductions in materials and labor
costs associated with pilot manufacturing for the clinical trial.  Research
and development expense for fiscal 2003 also included $5.2 million in costs associated
with continued improvements to the BVS product line, including efforts to
develop and obtain regulatory approval for our new AB5000 console and new
single-use blood pump which is intended to improve upon the ease of use,
quality of life, and mobility offered for post-cardiotomy and other short-term
bridge-to-recovery patients provided by the current BVS 5000 blood pump.  Research and development expense also
included costs associated with future heart assist blood pumps and cannulae
that are expected to operate with the new AB5000 platform.  Also included in research and development
expense during fiscal 2003 are costs associated with continued development and
testing of the AbioCor II and evaluation of other potential product opportunities.  We anticipate that the majority of our
near-term focus will be on further extending the BVS product line, successfully
continuing the initial AbioCor clinical trial, and developing the AbioCor II.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.4
million, or 8%, from $16.1 million in the prior year to $14.7 million in fiscal
year ended March 31, 2003.  This
decrease was primarily attributable to reduced labor and benefit costs, public
relations and travel costs.  Partially
offsetting these expense reductions was the additional fees and other expenses
we incurred related to the replacement of Arthur Andersen as our auditors.


Interest
and Other Income

.
Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances,
net of expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss.  Interest and other income decreased by $1.6 million from $2.9
million in fiscal 2002 to $1.3 million in fiscal 2003. This decrease was
primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from lower average
interest rates and lower average fund balances available for investment.  This decline in investment income was
partially offset by foreign translation gains as a result of the stronger Euro
against the U.S. dollar.

Net
Loss

. Net
loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 was approximately $18.2
million, or $0.87 per share. This compares to a net loss of approximately $21.2
million, or $1.02 per share, for the prior fiscal year. The losses for both
years are primarily attributable to development and clinical testing costs
associated with the AbioCor, the AbioCor II, the AB5000 console and costs of
developing other technologies and products.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have supported our
operations with net revenues from sales of our BVS and AB5000 circulatory
assist product line, government contracts and proceeds from our equity
offerings.  As of March 31, 2004,
our cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and long-term investments
totaled $45.5 million.

During the year we improved our financial performance from
business operations resulting in substantial reduction in our use of cash.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, cash used by operating
activities was $10.1 million, or 37%, less than the $16.2 million used by
operations in the comparable period of the prior year.  Net cash consumption from all activities, as
determined by the net change in cash, short-term marketable securities and
long-term investments, decreased to $8.9 million for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2004, compared to $16.9 million consumed in the prior fiscal
year.  The difference of $8.0 million
represents a 47% decline in cash consumption.

We have invested a
substantial portion of our funds in marketable securities with maturities
staggered over a period extending from one to two years in order to realize
higher rates of return on our cash reserves without compromising a high degree
of security.   As a result, in our
financial statements we have classified $18.2 million of our investments as
long-term.  These investments were made
possible by the improvement in our financial performance in recent years,
yielding, in the absence of a strategic technology acquisition, lower cash
demands as our business continues to grow.

Income taxes incurred
during the fiscal year 2004 were not material, and we continue to have
significant net tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

We believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing
resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations, including the
planned expenditures for our AbioCor and AbioCor II implantable replacement
hearts, and development and commercialization efforts for our BVS 5000 and
AB5000 circulatory assist products, for at least the next twelve months.  We may, however, need additional funds for
possible strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies
complementary to our business and their subsequent integration and operating
capital. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to
time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings.


Contractual Obligations
and Commercial Commitments

The following table (in thousands) summarizes our contractual
obligations at March 31, 2004 and the effects such obligations are
expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

The Company has no long-term debt or material commitments at
March 31, 2004, other than normal trade payables and accrued expenses
incurred in the normal operation of its business as reflected in our reported
balance sheet.  We have elected not to
exercise a buyout option available under the Company’s primary lease that would
have allowed for early termination of the lease in 2005.

Subsequent to our fiscal year ending March 31, 2004,
ABIOMED’s management team has been strengthened by a number of new appointments
to fill existing senior-level vacancies and/or newly defined senior management
functions.  We estimate that our
one-time costs associated with recruiting and relocation of these new
personnel, much of which will be recorded during the Company’s first quarter of
our fiscal year ending March 31, 2005 will approximate $750,000.

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation (FIN) No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an
interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34

. This interpretation expands the disclosure
requirements of guarantee obligations and requires the guarantor to recognize a
liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under a guarantee.  In general, FIN No. 45 applies to contracts
or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make
payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument
that is related to an asset, liability, or equity security of the guaranteed
party.  We apply the disclosure
provisions of FIN 45 to agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification
clauses.  These disclosure provisions
expand those required by SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, by requiring
that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of
requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The following is a description
of arrangements in which we are a guarantor.

Product
warranties – The Company routinely accrues for estimated future warranty costs
on its product sales at the time of sale. 
The AB5000 and BVS products are subject to rigorous regulation and
quality standards.  While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including
monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers, its warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates.  Operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost
of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision.

Patent
indemnifications – In many sales transactions, we indemnify customers against
possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products.  The indemnifications contained within sales
contracts usually do not include limits on the claims. We have never incurred
any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims
related to sales transactions.  As a
result, the estimated fair value of the potential liability is minimal.  Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded
for patent infringement as of March 31, 2004.

Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.
Current and prospective investors should carefully consider each of the risks
and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other
information in this Report. Our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be severely harmed by any of the following risks. The trading
price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks and uncertainties
develop into actual events.


Our
future success is strongly dependent on development of new assist products and
implantable replacement heart devices. Our development efforts may not be
successful.

We are currently devoting our major research and development and
regulatory efforts, and significant financial resources, to the development of
the AbioCor and AbioCor II and product extensions of existing commercial
products. The development of assist and replacement heart devices such as the
AbioCor and AbioCor II, and other new products, presents enormous challenges in
a variety of areas, many or all of which we may have difficulty in overcoming,
including blood compatible surfaces, blood compatible flow, manufacturing
techniques, pumping mechanisms, physiological control, energy transfer,
anatomical fit and surgical techniques. Specifically, for many years, we and
other parties have been attempting to develop a heart replacement device, but
to date, none of these efforts has been proven successful. We cannot be sure
that we will be successful in our development efforts, and in the event that we
are unable to commercialize the AbioCor and AbioCor II, our business and
financial condition would be adversely affected.

The
markets for our products under development are unproven.

Even if our products are successfully developed and approved by
the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities, they may not enjoy
commercial acceptance or success, which would adversely affect our business and
results of operations. Several factors could limit our success, including:

•

our need to create a market for our
new products, AB5000, AbioCor, AbioCor II, and possible limited market
acceptance among physicians, medical centers, patients and third party payers;

•

the need for surgeons to develop or
be trained in new surgical techniques to use our product effectively;

•

limitations on the number of
patients who may have access to physicians and medical centers with adequate
training, equipment and personnel to make use of our products;

•

limitations inherent in first
generation devices, and the potential failure to develop successive
improvements, including increases in service life, which would reduce the
addressable market for our products;

•

the lifestyle limitations that
patients will have to accept;

•

the timing and amount of
reimbursement for these products, if any, by third party payers;

•

the introduction by other companies
of new treatments, products and technologies which compete with our products,
and may reduce their market acceptance, or make them obsolete;

•

the reluctance, due to ethical
considerations, of physicians, patients and society as a whole to accept
significant medical devices that replace or assist the heart; and

•

the reluctance of physicians,
patients and society as a whole to accept the finite life and risk of
mechanical failure of devices that replace or assist the heart.

The commercial success of the AB5000, AbioCor, AbioCor II and
other heart assist products will require acceptance by cardiovascular surgeons
and interventional and heart failure cardiologists, a limited number of whom
significantly influence medical device selection and purchasing decisions. We
may achieve our business objectives only if our other products are accepted and
recommended by leading physicians, which is likely to be based on a
determination by these physicians that our products are safe, cost-effective
and represent acceptable methods of treatment. Although we have developed
relationships with leading cardiac surgeons and cardiologists, we cannot assure
that these existing relationships and arrangements can


be maintained or that new relationships will be established in
support of our products. If cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists do not
consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac
patient population or if a sufficient number of physicians recommend and use
competing products, it would seriously harm our business.

Testing
of our new products will involve uncertainties and risks which could delay or
prevent new product introductions, require us to incur substantial additional
costs or result in our failure to bring our products to market.

Development and testing of design changes to the AbioCor, AbioCor
II and other products under development is often extensive, expensive and time
consuming. Some of the tests for our products may require months or years to
perform, and we could be required to begin these tests again if we modify one
of our products to correct a problem identified in testing. Even modest changes
to certain components of our products can take months or years to complete and
test. If results of pre-clinical or clinical testing of our products under
development indicate that design changes are required, such changes could cause
serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations. A number
of companies in the medical industry have suffered delays, cost overruns and
project terminations despite achieving promising results in pre-clinical
testing or early clinical testing. In the event that we suffer setbacks in the
pre-clinical or clinical testing of our heart assist and replacement products,
these products may be delayed, require further funding, and possibly may not be
brought to market.

If
we fail to obtain approval from the FDA and from foreign regulatory
authorities, we cannot market and sell the AbioCor or other products in the
U.S. and in other countries.

If we cannot demonstrate through clinical testing on humans or
other means that the AbioCor or other new products under development and
testing are safe and effective, we will not be able to obtain regulatory
approvals in the U.S. or other countries for the commercial sale of these
products. Our clinical testing of the AbioCor is in its early stages. Delays,
budget overruns, and project terminations are not uncommon even after promising
pre-clinical and clinical trials of medical products. We intend to conduct
clinical testing for the AbioCor and other heart assist and heart replacement
products with critically ill patients, and these patients may die or suffer
other adverse medical results for reasons which may or may not be related to
the product being tested. Those outcomes could seriously delay the completion
of clinical testing, as could the unavailability of suitable patients for
clinical trials, both of which are outside our control. We cannot assure that
the rate of patient enrollment in our clinical trials will be consistent with
our expectations or be sufficient to allow us to complete our clinical trials
for the AbioCor or our other products under development in a timely manner, if
at all. Delays could defer the marketing and commercial sale of our products,
require further funding, and possibly result in failure to bring the products
to market.

We have announced our intention to seek and obtain initial
approval from the FDA to market the AbioCor under an HDE rather than through a
PMA.  Approval of an HDE by the FDA
requires that we demonstrate that the AbioCor is safe, potentially effective
and that its benefits outweigh its associated risks.  While the FDA has designated the AbioCor as appropriate for an
HDE, we cannot assure that the FDA or any other regulatory authority will act
quickly or favorably on our requests for this product approval, or that the FDA
or any other regulatory authority will not require us to provide additional
data that we do not currently anticipate in order to obtain product
approvals.  If we are successful in
obtaining FDA approval for the AbioCor based on a phased approach that begins
with an HDE, the initial approval is likely to include conditions or
limitations to particular indications that would limit the available market for
these products. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of
the AbioCor or our other products under development, or if the patient
populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad, the
commercial success of these products could be limited.

We intend to market the AbioCor and our other new products in
international markets, including the European Union and Japan. We must obtain
separate regulatory approvals in order to market our products in other
jurisdictions. The approval process may differ among those jurisdictions and
approval in the U.S. or in


any other jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other
jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays,
difficulties and costs for us, and require additional trials and additional
expense.

If
we obtain regulatory approval of our new products, the products will be subject
to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements, which could affect
the manufacturing and marketing of our products.

The FDA continues to review products even after they have received
initial approval. If and when the FDA approves the AbioCor, or our other
products under development, the manufacture and marketing of these products
will be subject to continuing regulation, including compliance with QSR,
adverse event reporting requirements and prohibitions on promoting a product
for unapproved uses.

We will also be required to obtain additional approvals in the
event we significantly modify the design of an approved product or the
product’s labeling or manufacturing process. Modifications of this type are
common with new products, and we anticipate that the first generation of each
of our products will undergo a number of changes, refinements and improvements
over time. For example, the current configuration of the AbioCor’s thoracic
unit, or “replacement heart,” is sized for patients with relatively large chest
cavities, and we anticipate that we will need to obtain regulatory approval of
thoracic units of other sizes. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approval
of modifications to our current and future products, the commercial success of
these products would be limited.

We and our third-party suppliers of product components are also
subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA for QSR and other
requirements. Enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with
government requirements could result in fines, suspensions of approvals,
recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, and
affect the manufacture and marketing of our products. The FDA could withdraw a
previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered
information, including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the occurrence
of unanticipated problems with products following approval, or other reasons,
which could adversely affect our operating results.

The
cost of developing and manufacturing the AbioCor, AbioCor II and other planned
new products is substantial for a company of our size and might exert a strain
on our available resources.

While our total research and development expenditures have
decreased, spending on our AbioCor, AbioCor II and other products under
development will remain significant for some time.  We expect that we will also need to make significant expenditures
to begin to manufacture and market the AbioCor and our other planned new
products in commercial quantities for sale in the U.S. and other countries, if
and when we obtain regulatory approval. We cannot be sure that our estimates of
capital expenditures for the development of our new products will be accurate.
We could have significant cost overruns, which could reduce our ability to
commercialize our products. Any delay or inability to commercialize our
products under development could adversely affect our business prospects and
results of operations.

We
do not operate at a profit and cannot be assured of future profitability

.

We have had net losses in each of the past three fiscal years. We
are committed to making large expenditures for our new products under
development in fiscal 2005 and subsequent fiscal years, which may result in
losses in future periods. These expenditures include costs associated with
performing clinical trials, continuing our research and development relating to
our new products under development, seeking regulatory approvals and, if we
receive these approvals, commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing. The
amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately, and cost
overruns may occur. We plan to fund a portion of these expenditures from our
limited existing financial resources and revenues from BVS and AB5000 product
sales. We cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize
our new products, or that additional funds will be available on commercially
acceptable terms,


if at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain the necessary
funding to develop and commercialize our products, our business may be
adversely affected.

Our
operating results may fluctuate unpredictably.

Our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated
historically and we expect these fluctuations to continue. Among the factors
that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are:

•

costs we incur developing and
testing the AbioCor, AbioCor II and other new products or product enhancements;

•

the timing of regulatory actions, such as product
approvals or recalls;

•

costs we incur in anticipation of future sales,
such as inventory purchases, expansion of manufacturing facilities, or
establishment of international sales offices;

•

the timing of customer orders and deliveries;

•

competitive
changes, such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our
competitors may make; and

•

economic
conditions in the health care industry and the state of cost containment
efforts, including reimbursement policies.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical and
future results will not necessarily be meaningful, and that investors should
not rely on them as an indication of future performance. To the extent we
experience the factors described above, our future operating results may not
meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time,
which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

The
BVS and AB5000 circulatory assist products, our principal product and current
primary source of revenues, are vulnerable to competitive pressures,
disruptions in sales, continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements.

All of our product revenues to date have come from sales of the
BVS and AB5000 products. We believe that we will continue to rely heavily on
these products for at least the next several years until we obtain regulatory
approval for new products. In the event that a competitor were to introduce new
treatments, products and technologies which compete with our products, add new
features to their existing products or reduce their prices to make their
products more financially attractive to customers, our revenue from our BVS and
AB5000 products could decline. For example, in the event of the expansion of
technologies, which allow heart surgical procedures to be performed without
stopping the heart, a reduction in the market for the BVS and AB5000 products
could potentially result. Further, the BVS and AB5000 are subject to stringent
and continuing FDA and other regulatory requirements, including compliance with
the QSR, adverse event reporting, prohibitions on promoting the products for
unapproved uses, and continued inspection and market surveillance by the FDA.
If our products are recalled or otherwise withdrawn from the market, our
revenues would likely decline, which would hurt our business. In addition,
variations in the quantity and timing of sales of our new AB5000 consoles have
a disproportionate effect on our revenues, because the price of the console is
substantially greater than the price of our disposable blood pumps. If we
cannot maintain and increase our disposable blood pump revenues from our BVS
and AB5000 product line, our overall business and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

Our product revenues increased in fiscal 2004 by 8% in comparison
to fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 our product revenues decreased by 7% in
comparison to fiscal 2002.  Revenues
derived from our BVS


extended term contracts were $1.0 in fiscal 2004 compared to $4.1
million in fiscal 2003 and $5.2 million in fiscal 2002.  To maintain or increase revenues from sales
of our current products, we may be required to adopt new sales and marketing
strategies, some of which may require expending additional capital resources,
or execute on existing strategies. The new strategies we may adopt or execute
on include:

•

regularly introducing enhancements
and product line extensions;

•

expanding sales of our BVS and
AB5000 product line in international markets, some of which require separate
regulatory approvals; and

•

seeking new categories of patients
to support with our technology platform.

In the event that we are unsuccessful in carrying out these new
strategies, our revenues may decline.

We
may not be successful in expanding our sales activities into international
markets.

We are seeking to expand our international sales of the BVS and
AB5000 circulatory assist systems by recruiting direct sales and support teams
for selected countries in Europe.  To
date we have limited experience in selling the our products internationally and
none with the AB5000 product.  In fiscal
2004, approximately 8%, and in fiscal 2003, approximately 6%, of our product
revenues were derived from international sales.  Our international operations will be subject to a number of
risks, which may vary from the risks we experience in the U.S., including:

•

the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries
before our products may be sold or used;

•

longer sales cycles;

•

dependence on local distributors;

•

limited protection of intellectual
property rights;

•

difficulty in collecting accounts
receivable;

•

fluctuations in the values of
foreign currencies; and

•

political and economic instability.

If we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in
international markets, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.

We
depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of
our products. If third party payers fail to provide appropriate levels of
reimbursement for purchase and use of our products, our profitability would be
adversely affected.

Sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of
patients’ medical expenses by government health care programs and private
health insurers. The cost of our BVS and AB5000 systems is substantial, and we
anticipate that the cost of implanting the AbioCor in a patient will also be
substantial. Without the financial support of the government or third party
insurers, the market for our products will be limited. Medical products and
devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and
private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered
by reimbursement, and if so, the level of reimbursement which may apply. We
cannot be sure that third party payors will reimburse


sales of our products now under development, or enable us to sell
them at profitable prices. We also cannot be sure that third party payors will
continue the current level of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers
for use of the BVS and AB5000. Any reduction in the amount of this
reimbursement could harm our business.

The federal government and private insurers have considered ways
to change, and have changed, the manner in which health care services are
provided and paid for in the U.S. In the future, it is possible that the
government may institute price controls and further limits on Medicare and
Medicaid spending. These controls and limits could affect the payments we
collect from sales of our products. Internationally, medical reimbursement
systems vary significantly, with some medical centers having fixed budgets,
regardless of levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring
application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. Even
if we succeed in bringing our new products to market, uncertainties regarding
future health care policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private
market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially
acceptable quantities at profitable prices.

Prior to approving coverage for new medical devices, most third
party payors require evidence that the product has received FDA approval, is
not experimental, and is medically necessary for the specific patient.
Increasingly, third party payors require evidence that the devices being used
are cost-effective. The AbioCor and our other products under development may
not meet these or future criteria, which could hurt our ability to market and
sell these products.

If
we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our
products require or if we are unable to develop additional manufacturing
capacity, we will not be successful.

Our products require precise, high quality
manufacturing. Our failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing
standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, design defects or
component failures, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or
withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns
or other problems that could seriously hurt our business. We have from time to
time voluntarily recalled certain products. Despite our very high manufacturing
standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or
failures. If we are not able to manufacture the BVS and AB5000 in accordance
with necessary quality standards, our business and results of operations may be
negatively affected.

The AbioCor involves even greater manufacturing complexities than
the BVS and AB5000 products. The AbioCor must be significantly more durable and
meet different standards, which may be more difficult to achieve, than those
that apply to our current product line. If we are unable to manufacture the
AbioCor or other future products on a timely basis at acceptable quality and
cost and in commercial quantities, or if we experience unanticipated
technological problems or delays in production, our business will suffer.

The manufacture of our products is and will continue to be complex
and costly, requiring a number of separate processes and components. Achieving
precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel.
Further, to be successful, we believe we will need to increase our
manufacturing capacity. We may experience difficulties in scaling up
manufacturing of our new products, including problems related to product yields,
quality control and assurance, component and service availability, adequacy of
control policies and procedures, and lack of skilled personnel. If we cannot
hire, train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical
workers, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our current
or future products at an acceptable cost and on time, which could limit market
acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business.

If
our suppliers cannot provide the components we require, our ability to
manufacture our products could be harmed.

We rely on third party suppliers to provide us with certain
components used in the AB5000, AbioCor, AbioCor II, BVS and our other products
under development. Relying on third party suppliers


makes us vulnerable to component part failures and to
interruptions in supply, either of which could impair our ability to conduct
clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis.
Using third party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to
test fully certain components, such as components on circuit boards, maintain
quality control, manage inventory and production schedules and control
production costs. Vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary
significantly and can exceed six months or more. Both now and as we expand our
manufacturing capacity, we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us
with required components when we need them. These factors could make it more
difficult for us to effectively and efficiently manufacture our products, and
could adversely impact our results of operations.

Some suppliers may be the only source for
a particular component, which makes us vulnerable to cost increases and supply
interruptions. Vendors may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain
products to the medical industry due to product liability or other concerns,
and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products. Manufacturers
of our product components may be required to comply with the FDA or other
regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in
connection with the manufacture of the components. If we cannot obtain a
necessary component, we may need to find, test and obtain regulatory approval
for a replacement component, produce the component ourselves or redesign the
related product, which would cause significant delay and could increase our
manufacturing costs. Any of these events could adversely impact our results of
operations.

We
own patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual
property and know-how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. If we
cannot protect our intellectual property, competition could force us to lower
our prices, which could hurt our profitability.

Our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a
critical component of our success. A substantial portion of our intellectual
property rights relating to the AB5000, BVS, AbioCor, AbioCor II and other
products under development is in the form of trade secrets, rather than
patents. In order to preserve certain proprietary information as trade secrets,
we are required to restrict disclosure of information intended to constitute
trade secrets to third parties. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary
knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees,
consultants and other parties. Certain of our consultants and third parties
with whom we have business relationships may also provide services to other
parties in the medical device industry, including companies, universities and
research organizations that are developing competing products. In addition,
some of our former employees may seek employment with, and become employed by,
our competitors. We cannot assure that confidentiality agreements with our
employees, consultants and third parties will not be breached, that we will
have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not become
known to or be independently developed by our competitors.  The loss of trade secret protection for
technologies or know-how relating to the AB5000, BVS, AbioCor or AbioCor II
could adversely affect our business prospects.

Our business position will also depend in part on our ability to
defend our existing and future patents and rights and conduct our business
activities free of infringement claims by third parties. We intend to seek
additional patents, but our pending and future patent applications may not be
approved, may not give us a competitive advantage, and could be challenged by
others. Patent proceedings in the U.S. and in other countries may be expensive
and time consuming. In addition, patents issued by foreign countries may afford
less protection than is available under U.S. patent law, and may not adequately
protect our proprietary information. Our competitors may independently develop
proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially
equivalent to ours, or design around our patents.

Companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents
and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation. Our
products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others. If a third
party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us, we may be
liable for substantial damages, be unable to sell products using that
technology, or have to seek a license or redesign


the related product. These alternatives may be uneconomical or
impossible. Patent litigation could be costly, result in product development
delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business.

If
we cannot attract and retain the management, sales and other personnel we need,
we will not be successful.

We depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of
our business, financial, technical, sales and support, regulatory and clinical,
operating and administrative management and staff, many of whom would be
difficult to replace. Competition for skilled and experienced business
management, scientific personnel and sales personnel in the medical devices
industry is intense. If we lose the services of any of the principal members of
our management and staff, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified
personnel in the future, especially scientific and sales personnel, our
business could be adversely affected.

We expect to grow rapidly if our products
under development advance through the approval process. The expansion of
personnel and facilities will strain our management and our financial and other
resources. If we cannot manage this growth successfully, our business will
likely suffer.

Product
liability claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results.

The clinical use of medical products, even after regulatory
approval, poses an inherent risk of product liability claims. We maintain
limited product liability insurance coverage, subject to deductibles and
exclusions. We cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be
available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at
reasonable costs, or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage
against potential liabilities. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or
potential outcome, may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of
our products or expand our business.

Many patients supported by our products do not survive. There are
many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death, including
the condition of the patient prior to use of the product, the skill and
reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the
product, and product maintenance by customers. However, the failure of the life
support products we distribute for clinical test or sale could give rise to
product liability claims and negative publicity.

The risk of product liability claims will increase as we introduce
new products that are intended to support a patient until the end of life. For
example, the AbioCor will have a finite life and could cause unintended
complications to other organs and may not be able to successfully support all
patients. Its malfunction could give rise to product liability claims whether
or not it has extended or improved the quality of the patient’s life. We cannot
be sure that we can obtain liability insurance to cover the AB5000, BVS,
AbioCor or other new products at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we have to
pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage, our financial
condition will be adversely affected.

Our
rights distribution, certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could make
it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent our
stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock.

Our rights distribution and provisions of
our certificate of incorporation and of the Delaware General Corporation Law
may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so
would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market
price of our stock. Our rights distribution and those provisions of our
certificate of incorporation and Delaware law are intended to encourage
potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our Board of Directors the
opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing
stockholder value. However, such provisions may also discourage acquisition
proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could negatively
affect our stock price.


The
market value of our common stock could vary significantly, based on market
perceptions of the status of our development efforts.

The perception of securities analysts
regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock
price. As a result, the market price of our common stock has and could in the
future change substantially when we or our competitors make product
announcements.  Many factors affecting
our stock price are industry related and beyond our control.

If
we make acquisitions, we could encounter difficulties that harm our business.

We may acquire companies, products or technologies that we believe
to be complementary to our business. If we do so, we may have difficulty
integrating the acquired personnel, operations, products or technologies. These
difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and
employees and increase our expenses, which could hurt our business.

ITEM 7A

.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

While we do not invest for speculative purposes, we are exposed to
market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our guidelines allow for an
investment portfolio consisting mainly of U.S. Treasury notes, federal agency
obligations, state and municipal bonds, and corporate bonds with maturities of
two years or less and ratings of at least AA by Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s. These held-to-maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and
will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates
were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at
March 31, 2004 the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by
approximately $33,000. However, we believe that we have the ability to hold our
fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our
operating results or cash flows to be affected by a change in market interest
rates on our securities portfolio.

CHANGES
IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

The information called for by this item has been previously
reported in our current report on Form 8-K filed on June 6, 2002.

ITEM
9A.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Acting Chief Financial Officer
(the principal accounting officer),

and all members of the senior management team held a
Disclosure Committee meeting on May 4, 2004 and after evaluating the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) have concluded that, based on such
evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
material information relating to the Company, including our consolidated
subsidiaries, was made known to them by others within those entities.


The effectiveness
of a system of disclosure controls and procedures is subject to various
inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision
making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of
internal controls, and the risk of fraud. Because of these limitations, there
can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures will
be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material
information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.

During the fourth quarter
of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, there were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that have affected, or are reasonably
likely to affect, materially our internal control over financial reporting.

Report
of Independent

Registered Public Accounting Firm

To Board of Directors and

Stockholders of ABIOMED, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of ABIOMED, Inc, and its subsidiaries at March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

MARCH 31, 2004

(1)

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

ABIOMED, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is engaged primarily in
the development, manufacture and marketing of medical products designed to
safely and effectively assist or replace the pumping function of the failing
heart. The Company is currently undergoing clinical trials for its
battery-powered totally implantable replacement heart system for patients who
would otherwise die from heart failure. The Company currently markets and sells
ventricular assist devices for the temporary support of patients with
reversible heart failure.

(2)

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting
policies described below.

(a)

Principles
of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(b)

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated or assumed.  The more significant estimates reflected in
these financial statements include unit pricing of our BVS blood pumps sold
under extended-term contracts, collectibility of accounts receivable, inventory
valuation and judgmental accrued expenses.

(c)

Revenue Recognition from Product Sales and Accounts
Receivable

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB 104”)
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in
financial statements.  SAB 104
establishes the SEC’s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue
until all of the following criteria are met: 
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is
fixed or determinable, and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.  Further, SAB 104 requires that both title
and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before
revenue can be recognized.  The Company
believes that its revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 104.

We derive our revenues from two principal sources; (1)
product sales, including maintenance service agreements, and (2) funded
research and development contracts and grants from government and other third
party sources. In fiscal 2002 and 2003, product revenues were derived from
sales of the Company’s BVS biventricular assist system, including related

F-7

products and
services.  In fiscal 2004 product
revenues also included initial sales of our new AB5000 circulatory support
system and related products. The majority of our BVS and AB5000 product
revenues are derived from our shipment of products to fulfill customer orders
for a specified number of consoles and blood pumps for a specified price. We
recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product
shipment.

During the three
years ending March 31, 2004 a declining percentage of our BVS product
revenue was derived from extended-term contracts with certain of our customers,
which provide the customers with units of our BVS product under contracts terms
of one to three years.  These contracts
provide for the Company to receive a fixed, non-refundable amount of money over
a set period of time in return for our providing these customers with BVS
product at the start of the contract and restocking the customer with BVS blood
pumps during the term of the contract. The exact quantity of such additional
pumps to be supplied, if any, is limited to the actual blood pump usage by the
customer to support their patients. In addition to SAB 104, we follow the more
recent guidance of EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

,
in our calculation and recognition of the relative sales value for each element
of these extended-term contracts.  In so
doing, we recognize revenue, and record related cost of product revenues,
ratably over the term of the contract using an estimated per unit selling price
based upon actual shipments of pumps to customers compared to the maximum
number of additional pumps allowable under the contract.  When a maximum number of pumps is not
specified in the sales contract, we compare actual shipments to our estimate of
additional pumps that might be required by the customer. In the majority of
contracts that contain contractual limits on the number of pumps, customers do
not use the maximum number of allowable pumps and, as a result, we recognize
the remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term with no
associated incremental cost at that time. For a small number of older contracts
that reached termination in fiscal 2004, we did not have a contractual maximum
number of pumps upon which to rely.  For
these contracts, we estimated customer blood pump usage and resulting per unit
selling price based upon historical experience.  Revenue recognized from extended-term contracts approximated
$5,200,000, $4,100,000 and $1,000,000 for the fiscal years ending
March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

Maintenance service revenues are less than 5% of total revenues and are
recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the
elapsed term of the service contract.

International sales represented 8%, 6% and 8% of
product revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of product
revenues or accounts receivable during fiscal 2002, 2003 or 2004.

F-8

(d)

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company continuously monitors collections and payments
from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated losses based upon
historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are
identified.  While such credit losses
have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, no
guarantee can be made that the Company will experience the same credit loss
rates that it has in the past.  If the
financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment
of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required

.

(e)

Funded Research and Development Revenues

A portion of the
Company’s research and development expenses has been supported by contracts and
grants with various government agencies and other third party sources. The
government-sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally
provide for payment on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. The Company recognizes
revenues under its government contracts and grants as work is performed,
provided that the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work.
Under contracts in which the Company elects to spend significantly more on the
development project during the term of the contract than the total contract
amount, the Company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably
over the term of the contract as it incurs related research and development
costs, provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work.
The Company retains rights to all technological discoveries and products
resulting from these efforts

.

(f)

Warranties

The Company routinely accrues for estimated future warranty
costs on its product sales at the time of sale.  The AB5000 and BVS products are subject to rigorous regulation
and quality standards.  While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including
monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers, its warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates.  Operating results could be adversely effected if the actual cost
of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision.  Warranty costs are included in costs of
sales within the consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimated
its obligation at $245,000 for fiscal 2004.

The following table summarizes the activities in the
warranty reserve for the year ended March 31, 2004 (in thousands).

F-9

(g)

Inventories

Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and consist of the
following (in thousands):

All of the
Company’s inventories on the balance sheet relate to the AB5000 and BVS product
lines. Because the AbioCor replacement heart is not yet available for
commercial sale, inventories do not currently include any costs associated with
AbioCor manufactured systems or component parts.  Finished goods and work-in-process inventories consist of direct
material, labor and overhead.

The Company
regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and write down to its net
realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired.  If actual demand or market conditions are
less favorable than projected demand, additional inventory write-downs may be
required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which
the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified.  The inventory balances at March 31,
2003 and March 31, 2004 are net of impairment write-downs of $722,000 and
$1,119,000, respectively.

(h)

Property and Equipment

The Company
provides for depreciation and amortization on property and equipment by charges
to operations in amounts that allocate the cost of depreciable assets over
their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:

Depreciation and
amortization expense related to property and equipment was $1,636,000,
$1,513,000 and $1,230,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003
and 2004, respectively.

F-10

(i)

Intellectual Property

The Company capitalizes as intellectual property costs
incurred, excluding costs associated with Company personnel, relating to
patenting its technology.  Capitalized
costs, the majority of which represent legal costs, reflect the cost of both
awarded patents and patents pending. 
The Company amortizes the cost of these patents over the estimated
useful life of the patents up to seven years. 
If the Company elects to stop pursuing a particular patent application
or determines that a patent application is not likely to be awarded for a
particular patent or elects to discontinue payment of required maintenance fees
for a particular patent, the Company at that time records as expense the net
capitalized amount of such patent application or patent.

(j)

Net Loss per Share

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal
year. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the
weighted-average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal
year. Dilutive shares outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted
shares outstanding any potential (unissued) common stock from outstanding stock
options and warrants based on the treasury stock method. In fiscal years when
net income is reported, the calculation of diluted net income per share
typically results in lower earnings per share than is calculated using the
basic method.  In fiscal years when a net
loss is reported, such as the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and
2004, these potential shares from stock options and warrants are not included
in the calculation because they would have an anti-dilutive effect, meaning the
loss per share would be reduced. 
Therefore, in fiscal years when a loss is reported the calculation of
basic and dilutive loss per share results in the same value.

The calculation of diluted weighted-average shares
outstanding for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004
excludes potential stock from unexercised stock options that have a purchase
price below the average market price as shown below.

The calculation of diluted weighted average shares
outstanding excludes unissued shares of Common Stock associated with
outstanding stock options that have exercise prices greater than the average
market price of fiscal years ending March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, the
weighted average number of these potential shares totaled 341,495, 2,463,715
and 1,908,347 shares, respectively.  The
calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for these fiscal
years also excludes warrants to purchase 400,000 share of common stock issued
in connection with the acquisition of intellectual property (see Note 4).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company
classifies any marketable security with a maturity date of 90 days or less at
the time of purchase as a cash equivalent.

(l)

Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments

The Company
classifies any security with a maturity date of greater than 90 days at the
time of purchase as marketable securities and classifies marketable securities
with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date as
long-term investments.  Under Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities,

securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at amortized cost
and classified as held-to-maturity securities.

The amortized
cost, including interest receivable, and market value of short-term marketable
securities were approximately $9,877,000 and $9,858,000 at March 31, 2003,
and $20,432,000 and $20,433,000 at March 31, 2004, respectively.

The amortized

2004, respectively.  There were no
long-term marketable securities at March 31, 2003.

At March 31,
2004 the investment portfolio consisted primarily of government securities and
corporate bonds with maturities of two years or less.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As of
March 31, 2003 and 2004, the Company’s financial instruments were
comprised of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts

requires disclosure of all components of comprehensive income and loss on an
annual and interim basis. Comprehensive income and loss is defined as the
change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.  Other than the reported net loss, there were
no components of comprehensive income or loss which require disclosure for the
years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the realizability of
long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-lived Assets and Disposal of Long-lived Assets

.  The Company reviews its long-lived assets
for impairment as events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable.  The
Company evaluates the realizability of its long-lived assets based on
profitability and cash flow expectations for the related asset.  As a result of its review, the Company does
not believe that any impairment currently exists related to its long-lived
assets.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company
accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method
as prescribed by APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

,
and related interpretations and has elected to follow the disclosure-only alternative
requirements of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”).  Accordingly, no
compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed
amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value
of Common Stock at the date of grant.

The Company
records compensation expense for certain stock option related events requiring
remeasurement in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44,

Accounting
for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation and Interpretation of APB
No. 25

.  Stock-based awards
to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with SFAS
123.

F-13

If compensation
cost for the Company’s fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 grants issued under
stock-based compensation plans, including costs related to prior years grants
had been determined based on SFAS 123, the Company’s pro forma net loss and pro
forma loss per share for the years ended March 31, would have been as
follows (in thousands, except per share data):

The fair value per share of the options granted during fiscal 2002,
2003 and 2004 was computed as $3.74, $1.69 and $1.53, per share, respectively

,

and
was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions.

In addition to compensation expense related to stock option grants, the
pro forma compensation expense shown in the table above includes compensation
expense related to stock issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase
Plan of approximately $39,000, $44,000 and $19,000 for fiscal 2002, 2003 and
2004, respectively.

This pro forma compensation expense may not be representative of the
amount to be expected in future years as pro forma compensation expense may vary
based upon the number of options granted and shares purchased.  The pro forma tax effect of the employee
compensation expense has not been considered due to the Company’s reported net
losses.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In
November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) reached a consensus on Issue 00-21,

Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

.  EITF Issue 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products,
services and/or rights to use assets. 
The provisions of EITF Issue 00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.  Adoption of EITF Issue 00-21 did not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 149”). SFAS 149
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133

, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities

. This statement is effective in fiscal 2004
for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging
relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2003, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

(“SFAS 150”).  SFAS 150 changes the accounting for certain
financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for
as equity. The new statement requires that those instruments be classified as
liabilities in statements of financial position. Most of the guidance in SFAS
150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003.  The adoption of this
statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,

Revenue

, which supercedes SAB No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial

.  SAB 104 rescinds
accounting guidance in SAB 101 related to multiple-element arrangements, as
this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF No.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND
OTHER ASSETS

Intellectual property and other assets includes costs
related to the Company’s awarded and pending patents. The Company is amortizing
the cost of these patents on a straight-line basis over seven years, the
estimated useful lives of the patents. The unamortized cost of these patents
approximated $742,000 and $569,000 as of March 31, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.  Amortization expense for
patents totaled $135,000, $191,000 and $158,000 for the years ending
March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively.  Expense for abandonment of certain patents totaled $63,000,
$235,000 and $55,000 for the years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.

CAPITAL STOCK

Each share of common stock has a voting right of one vote per share and
generally has the right to elect, as a class, at least 25% of the Company’s
directors.

The Company has
authorized 1,000,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value,
of which the Board of Directors can set the designation, rights and
privileges.  No shares of Class B
Preferred Stock have been issued or are outstanding.

In August 1997, the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred
Share Purchase Right (the Right) for each outstanding share of common stock to
its stockholders of record at August 28, 1997.  Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, at a price of $45.00 per one
one-thousandth of a share, subject to amendment. In accordance with the terms
set forth in the Rights Agreement, the Rights are not exercisable until the
occurrence of certain events, as defined. In addition, the registered holders
of the Rights will have no rights as a common stockholder of the Company until
the Rights are exercised. The Company’s Board of Directors may amend the terms
of the Rights. The Rights expire on August 13, 2007.

In September 2000, the Company issued common stock and warrants to
acquire the exclusive rights to the Penn State Heart together with complete
ownership of a company incorporated to commercialize the Penn State Heart
called BeneCor Heart Systems, Inc. The terms of this transaction consisted of
payment of 110,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, plus the issuance of
warrants to purchase up to 400,000 additional shares of the Company’s common
stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. 
Exercise of the warrants is contingent on the achievement of certain
clinical and regulatory milestones with the Penn State Heart by specified
dates, the last of which is September 30, 2007.  Warrants not vested and exercised by September 30, 2007 expire.
The value of the common stock and warrants issued in connection with the
transaction are included in stockholders’ equity at values of $3,145,000 and
$3,145,000, respectively, representing the fair value of the stock and warrants
based on the closing market price for the Company’s stock on the closing date
for this transaction.  These amounts
were fully expensed as in-process research and development on the date of
acquisition because the technology had no future alternate use. As of
March 31, 2004, 400,000 warrants were outstanding and none were exercisable.

INCOME TAXES

The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”)

.

The asset and liability approach used under SFAS 109 requires
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax
basis of other assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the
financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates.  A valuation reserve is established if it is more likely than not
that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Accordingly, a valuation reserve has been
established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset.

At March 31, 2004, the Company had federal and state NOL
carryforwards of approximately 
$61,100,000 and $30,200,000, which begin to expire in 2005.  Additionally, at March 31, 2004, the
Company had federal and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards
of approximately $4,500,000 and $3,000,000, respectively, which begin to expire
in 2006.  Based upon the Internal
Revenue Code, certain changes in company ownership may subject these carryforwards
to an annual limitation.

The
components of the Company’s net deferred taxes were as follows at March 31
(in thousands):

The
effective tax rate of zero differs from the statutory rate of 34% primarily due
to the inability of the Company to recognize deferred tax assets for its
operating losses and tax credits.  Of
the total valuation allowance, approximately $2,400,000 relates to stock option
compensation deductions.  The tax
benefit associated with the stock option compensation deductions will be
credited to equity when realized.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The
Company applies the disclosure provisions of FIN No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,
and Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34

(FIN No. 45)

.

to its agreements that
contain guarantee or indemnification clauses. 
These disclosure provisions expand those required by SFAS No. 5

Accounting
for Contingencies

, by requiring that guarantors disclose certain
types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s
performance is remote.  The following is
a description of arrangements in which the Company is a guarantor.

Product
warranties — The Company routinely accrues for estimated future warranty costs
on its product sales at the time of sale. 
The AB5000 and BVS products are subject to rigorous regulation and
quality standards.  While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including
monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers, its warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates.  Operating results could be adversely effected if the actual cost
of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision.

Patent
indemnifications — In many sales transactions, the Company indemnifies
customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by the
Company’s products.  The
indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits
on the claims. The Company has never incurred any material costs to defend
lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales
transactions.  Under the provisions of
FIN No. 45, intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only.

As
of March 31, 2004, the Company had entered into leases for its facilities,
including its primary operating facility in Danvers, Massachusetts, with terms
through fiscal 2010.  The Company has
elected not to exercise a buyout option available under its primary lease that
would have allowed for early termination in 2005. Total rent expense under
these leases, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations, was approximately $856,000, $823,000 and $821,000 for the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

During the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2000, the Company entered into 36-month operating leases
totaling approximately $644,000 for the lease of office furniture.  These leases ended in fiscal year 2003 and
at the Company’s option the furniture was purchased.  Rental expense recorded for these leases during the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2002 and 2003 was approximately $215,000 and $127,000
respectively.

During fiscal 2000, the Company entered into a
36-month capital lease for computer equipment and software for approximately
$221,000.  This lease ended in fiscal
year 2003 and at the Company’s option these assets were purchased.

F-18

Future minimum lease payments
under all non-cancelable operating leases as of March 31, 2004 are
approximately as follows (in thousands):

From time-to-time, the Company is involved in legal and administrative
proceedings and claims of various types. While any litigation contains an
element of uncertainty, management, in consultation with the Company’s general
counsel, presently believes that the outcome of each such other proceedings or
claims which are pending or known to be threatened, or all of them combined,
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.

STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS

With the exception
of 15,654 options outstanding at March 31, 2004 that were granted to
certain employees with an exercise price of $0.01 per share, all stock options
granted by the Company under the below-described plans were granted with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. For the
options granted below fair market value, compensation expense of $72,000 will
be recognized ratably over the four-year vesting period in accordance with SFAS
123.  Outstanding stock options, if not
exercised, expire 10 years from the date of grant.

The 1992 Combination Stock Option Plan (the “Combination Plan”), as
amended, was adopted in September 1992 as a combination and restatement of
the Company’s then outstanding Incentive Stock Option Plan and Nonqualified
Plan. A total of 2,670,859 options were awarded from the Combination Plan
during its ten-year restatement term that ended on May 1, 2002.  As of March 31, 2004, 927,420 of these
options remain outstanding and eligible for future exercise.  These options are held by Company employees and
generally become exercisable ratably over five years.

The 1998 Equity Incentive Plan, (the “Equity
Incentive Plan”), was adopted by the Company in August 1998.  The Equity Incentive Plan provides for
grants of options to key employees, directors, advisors and consultants as
either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options as determined by
the Company’s Board of Directors.  A
maximum of 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be awarded under this plan.  Options granted under the Equity Incentive
Plan are exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as the Board of
Directors may specify at the time of each stock option grant.  Options outstanding under the Equity
Incentive Plan have vesting periods of 3 to 5 years from the date of grant.

The 2000 Stock Incentive Plan,
(the “2000 Plan”), as amended, was adopted by the Company in
August 2000.  The 2000 Plan
provides for grants of options to key employees, directors, advisors

F-19

and consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries
as either incentive or nonqualified stock options as determined by the
Company’s Board of Directors.  Up to
2,900,000 shares of common stock may be awarded under the 2000 Plan and are
exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as the Board of Directors
may specify at the time of each stock option grant. Options outstanding under
the 2000 Plan generally vest 4 years from the date of grant.

The Company has a nonqualified stock option plan
for non-employee directors (the “Directors’ Plan”). The Directors’ Plan, as
amended, was adopted in July 1989 and provides for grants of options to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock to non-employee Directors of the
Company. Up to 400,000 shares of common stock may be awarded under the
Directors’ Plan. Options outstanding under the Director’s Plan have vesting
periods of 1 to 5 years from the date of grant.

The following table summarizes stock option activity under all of the
Company’s stock option plans:

F-20

During the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2002, certain optionholders exercised options in cashless
exercises. The total number of options exercised in this manner was 35,000.
These cashless transactions triggered remeasurement on the date of exercise for
the difference of between the fair market value of the common stock underlying
the stock options and the exercise price of the stock options. The Company
recorded expense of $240,000 for the year ended March 31, 2002 to reflect
these remeasurements. The options had originally been granted to the
optionholders with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant.  No cashless
exercises of stock options occurred during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2003 and 2004.

The following
table summarizes certain data for options outstanding and exercisable under all
plans at March 31, 2004.

The Company has an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan), as amended.  Under the Purchase Plan, eligible employees
(including officers and directors) who have completed six months of employment
with the Company or its subsidiaries who elect to participate in the Purchase
Plan instruct the Company to withhold a specified amount from each payroll
period during a six-month payment period (the periods April 1 -
September 30 and October 1 - March 31).  On the last business day of each payment
period, the amount withheld is used to purchase common stock at an exercise
price equal to 85% of the lower of its market price on the first business day
or the last business day of the payment period.  Up to 500,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the
Purchase Plan, of which 305,350 shares are available for future issuance as of
March 31, 2004.  During the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, 20,516, 66,331 and 28,837
shares of common stock, respectively, were sold pursuant to the Purchase Plan

.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Research and development is a significant portion
of the Company’s operations. The Company’s research and development efforts are
focused on the development of new products, primarily related to cardiac assist
and heart replacement, including the continued enhancement of the AB5000 and
BVS products and related technologies. 
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and include
direct materials and labor, depreciation, contracted services and other costs
associated with developing new products and significant enhancements to
existing products, including amortized costs of purchased technology. Costs
associated with government-funded contracts and grants are recorded in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of research and
development expenses as shown in the table below.

The Company, at its sole discretion, may elect to
further develop government-funded technologies or products by spending
resources outside or above the contract limits. In fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004,
the majority of the Company’s research and development expenditures were
directed towards the development and preparation of the AbioCor Implantable
Replacement Heart, which is in initial human clinical trials.  Future costs for such development cannot be
definitively estimated at this time and are likely to be highly variable based
upon a number of factors, including clinical results and regulatory
requirements.

Research and development costs consist of the
following amounts (in thousands):
