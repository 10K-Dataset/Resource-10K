PART
I

ITEM
1.

BUSINESS

Overview

ABIOMED is a
leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed
safely and effectively to assist, recover or replace the pumping function of the
failing heart. ABIOMED’s BVS 5000 Biventricular Support System is the most
widely used advanced heart assist device for the treatment of all patients with
failing but potentially recoverable hearts in the U.S.  Our newer AB5000 Circulatory Support System
incorporates a number of advanced features to facilitate patient mobility and
transport and to better meet the needs of physicians and hospitals treating
heart assist patients.  The AB5000 is
also designed to provide an adaptable common platform for a family of blood
pumps, which in the future, subject to FDA approval, will be able to support a
broader population of patients for longer periods of time. Our AbioCor
Implantable Replacement Heart, the world’s first battery-powered implantable
replacement heart system, was submitted to the FDA for limited commercial
approval under an HDE in September 2004. 
The FDA has subsequently announced that it will convene a special expert
panel of cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists on June 23, 2005 to
review and potentially to decide whether a recommendation should be made for
the groundbreaking technologies and clinical trial data behind the
AbioCor.  The AbioCor, the development of
which follows decades of fundamental and applied research, development and
testing, is intended to extend life and provide an improved quality of life for
end-stage acute and chronic heart failure patients.  Another area of focused effort involves
adaptation and development of the AbioCor II Heart, based on technology
acquired in 2000 from The Pennsylvania State University. The AbioCor II Heart
has a drive mechanism that is different than the AbioCor design, and is the
only implantable heart system other than the AbioCor to survive the rigor of
the replacement heart development program funded by the U.S. National Heart
Lung and Blood Institute (“NHLBI”).  We
are also engaged in significant research and development related to other
devices to assist, recover or replace the pumping function of the heart and we
continue to investigate enhancements to our exiting product line in order to
serve more patients who require mechanical heart assistance.

In May 2005,
we completed our acquisition of Impella CardioSystems AG (Impella), located in
Aachen, Germany.  Impella manufactures,
sells and supports the world’s smallest, minimally invasive, high performance
micro blood pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use in interventional
cardiology and heart surgery.  Impella
has CE marks for each of its devices and currently markets them throughout
Europe.

The Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Impella in exchange for approximately $1,600,000 in cash and 4,029,004 shares
of ABIOMED common stock.  The agreement
also provides for a contingent payments in cash, ABIOMED stock, or a
combination of both, based on the Company’s future stock price performance and
additional milestone payments related to FDA approvals and unit sales of
Impella products.

Our BVS is a
“bridge-to-recovery” device that can temporarily assume the pumping function of
the heart for patients with potentially reversible heart failure. It is
intended for use in patients whose hearts can recover within a period of a few
weeks. In 1992, the BVS became the first heart assist device capable of
providing full circulatory support to be approved by the FDA. The BVS is the
most widely used FDA-approved temporary heart assist device, and to date has
been used to support thousands of patients at over 600 medical centers
worldwide. The BVS primarily consists of single-use external blood pumps and
cannulae, and a drive and control console.

In April 2003,
we received FDA approval to market the AB5000 Circulatory Support System
Console, and in September 2003 we received approval to market the AB5000
Ventricle, an advanced circulatory support blood pump.   The AB5000 console can drive and control
either BVS or AB5000 blood pumps, and provides an upgradeable platform for
continued circulatory assist product line enhancements.  The AB5000 was introduced with the same
indications for use as the BVS, but it is our intention to seek FDA approval
for expanded indications of use for the AB5000 to encompass broader patient
populations and lengthened periods of patient support.


Our AbioCor
is a heart replacement device that replaces the failing ventricles of the heart
and takes over the heart’s blood pumping function.  It is designed for use in patients at risk of
imminent death due to irreparably heart damage, but whose other vital organs
remain viable. We believe the AbioCor will provide a much-needed treatment
option for those patients in the U.S. for whom no effective therapy is
currently available. This is the first completely self-contained artificial
heart ever to come before the FDA for review.

We are also
conducting animal studies on our second-generation artificial heart, AbioCor
II. The AbioCor II is approximately 30% smaller and is expected to function
more than three times longer than the present AbioCor, providing the capability
to serve many more patients while increasing the quality of life for these
patients.

Our focused
research and development related to these products has provided us with the
proprietary technology, know-how and experience that we are using to develop additional
products. We believe we are the only company in the world with technical
background and expertise in the full range of technology to support and replace
the pumping function of the heart with a total artificial heart. We believe
that there are many opportunities to apply our expertise to address the needs
of heart failure patients. We seek to be first to market with high-quality and
cost-effective technologies for heart failure patients who currently lack
adequate therapies.

Industry Overview

Heart Disease

Heart
disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., annually claiming more
than 700,000 lives in the U.S. 
Internationally, heart disease accounts for nearly one third of all
deaths, killing 16.7 million people (according to World Health Organization
estimates), including more than 4 million in Europe alone. Illnesses and deaths
from heart disease create an immense burden to many individuals and their
families. Patients frequently experience extended suffering, and the economic
cost can be substantial. While a number of therapies exist for the treatment of
patients in early stages of heart disease, limited therapies exist today for most
patients with severe end-stage heart failure.

The majority
of deaths from heart disease can be attributed to coronary heart disease and
congestive heart failure. Other types of heart disease include rhythm disorders
and diseases of the valves.

Coronary heart disease is a disease of the
coronary arteries causing reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery
to the affected portion of the heart. Coronary heart disease can lead to a
heart attack, also known as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and may result
in permanent damage to the heart muscle. 
In severe heart attacks, death can occur suddenly or gradually over days
and weeks.  Each year, approximately
865,000 people in the U.S. experience AMI. 
Of these cases, 7% to 10% suffer from cardiogenic shock, preventing
blood flow from the heart.  Cardiogenic
shock

is the leading cause of mortality for patients hospitalized with
AMI, resulting in death in up to 50% of cases.

Congestive
heart failure is a condition resulting from the progressive deterioration of
the heart over extended periods of time. The patient’s heart cannot provide
adequate blood flow and oxygen to meet the


needs of the body. Congestive heart
failure may be initiated and aggravated by a variety of factors, including high
blood pressure, defective heart valves, coronary heart disease, infections of
the heart muscle or the valves and problems resulting from heart defects. Due
to the progressive nature of congestive heart failure, medical interventions
often take place over periods of months or years.

In general,
heart failure is progressive. While approximately 63% of all heart failure
patients experience sudden death as a result of cardiac arrest, the remaining
patients who die from heart failure typically do so in hospitals or long-term
care facilities.

Prevalence, Incidence
and Mortality

The American
Heart Association reports in the 2005 update on

Heart
Disease and Stroke Statistics

that a total of 70.1 million people in
the United States live with some form of cardiovascular disease, including 65.0
million with high blood pressure.  Of
those, 13.0 million were diagnosed with coronary heart disease, 4.9 million
with congestive heart failure. Thus, coronary heart disease patients outnumbered
congestive heart failure patients by approximately 2.7:1.  For patients newly diagnosed within 2002,
however, the ratio of coronary heart disease to congestive heart failure
patients was 2.2:1, indicating that congestive heart failure is becoming
relatively more important as time goes on. 
We believe this trend is primarily attributable to the aging of the
population. Congestive heart failure is primarily a condition of the elderly.

According to
the National Center for Health Statistics, approximately 700,000 people died of
heart disease in the U.S. in 2002. 
According to the same source, nearly 371,000 of these deaths were
attributable to coronary (ischemic) heart disease, approximately 42,000 were
attributable to congestive heart failure, and approximately 287,000 were
attributable to other diagnoses.  We
believe that a close examination of the various categories included in those
other diagnoses reveals that many of those deaths may have been attributable to
congestive heart failure related conditions.

Therapies for Heart
Disease

A broad
spectrum of treatment is available for heart disease patients.  Treatments include drug therapies,
cardiological interventions, including closed chest procedures (angioplasty and
stents) and rhythm management therapies, or surgical corrections, such as
coronary bypass surgery and valve replacement. These therapies are sometimes
successful in slowing the progression of heart disease, extending life, and/or
improving the quality of life for some period of time.  For patients with end-stage heart disease,
however, these treatments are typically inadequate. Patients with the most
severe heart disease, those at identifiable risk of death, frequently are in
need of mechanical circulatory support or heart replacement. Because the supply
of available donor hearts is limited, with fewer than 2,200 per year available
in the U.S., heart assist and replacement treatments have been and continue to
be developed with the goal of extending and improving the lives of these patients.

The Market for
Circulatory Support Devices in the U.S.

At present,
due to the stage of technological development, circulatory support devices are
typically used only after other, less-invasive therapies have been found to be
inadequate.  The appropriate reference
group from which to begin analysis of the potential market for these devices
are the patients who die each year of heart disease: approximately 700,000 in
the U.S. and the estimated 16.7 million around the globe.  In the future, when devices have matured and
become less invasive, more durable and reliable, and surgical and patient
management techniques have improved, these devices may become appropriate
choices for less emergently ill patients and the potential addressable market
may be much larger.

Not all of
the patients who die each year of heart disease are addressable by circulatory
support devices.  Many patients not
classifiable as coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure patients are
not suitable candidates for circulatory support.  In addition, more than 60% of all cardiac
deaths occur suddenly, outside of the hospital or in the Emergency Room, and
therefore cannot be reached by this therapy. 
Some


suffer significant comorbidities that
might rule out device implantation, and many are simply too frail to withstand
the rigors of device implantation and surgical recovery.  As a result, we estimate that the total
number of patients addressable today by mechanical circulatory support devices
ranges from 60,000 to 100,000 patients per year in the U.S.

This and any
other estimate of market size should be viewed as dynamic and subject to change
on account of a variety of factors.  For
example, both the percentage of heart disease patients who are unreachable
because they die suddenly and the percentage of patients who are untreatable
because of frailty are important determinants of the total circulatory support
device market.  Both of those variables
are susceptible to change over time as technology improves and patient
management techniques mature.  The total
size of the market will also be affected by demographic trends, most
particularly by the aging of the so-called “baby boom” generation.  That generation is just approaching the age
at which heart disease becomes a major medical problem, and it is reasonable to
postulate that the pool of heart disease patients will increase as the baby
boom generation ages.

Current
penetration of the potential market for circulatory support devices, measured
by number of devices implanted annually, is low but is expected to increase
fairly rapidly in the next few years.  An
independent report by Health Research International, published in March 2004,
estimated the total value of advanced mechanical circulatory support sales in
2004 in the U.S. to be $145.9 million, and projected a compound annual growth
rate of 43.1% from 2003 through 2008.

Temporary Heart
Assist

. Candidates for
temporary heart assist devices include patients with severe but potentially
reversible heart failure and patients whose hearts need help pumping blood
while they await transplantation or other therapies. Temporary heart assist
devices typically consist of a specialized pump that is attached to a patient’s
heart and driven by a console or powered by an external battery pack. Such
devices are intended to be removed from a patient’s body once the patient’s
heart has had the opportunity to recover its normal function, or when the
patient receives the next appropriate therapy. Temporary heart assist devices
can be grouped into three categories:

Bridge-to-Recovery

. Bridge-to-recovery devices are used to support patients with
potentially reversible heart failure. These devices are most frequently used to
support patients whose hearts suffer shock following open-heart surgery and who
cannot be weaned off the heart-lung machine. Of the patients who experience
such complications, many who die each year could potentially be saved with a
temporary assist device as a “bridge to recovery.” Bridge-to-recovery devices
temporarily assume the pumping function of the heart, while allowing the heart
to rest, heal and recover its normal function. These devices can also be used
for patients who have not undergone surgery but whose lives are threatened by
viral infections that attack the heart muscle. In addition, bridge-to-recovery
devices may prove beneficial to certain patients who have suffered from a
recent heart attack and their heart has gone into shock.  This younger patient population may need
support for 2 to 3 times longer for their hearts to recover.

The number
of patients who might be candidates for a bridge-to-recovery device on account
of post-cardiotomy shock each year is a function of the number of patients who
undergo open-heart surgery and the percentage of such surgeries that result in
shock.  There are approximately 400,000
open heart operations annually in the United States, a number that has steadily
been trending down as medical practice shifts toward less-invasive
options.  According to the Society of
Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database, 3.4% of coronary
artery bypass operations in 1999 resulted in cardiogenic shock, yielding a
potential bridge-to-recovery market of approximately 13,000 patients.  In 2002, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons
reported that the cardiogenic shock rate had dropped to 1.9 %, yielding an
estimated market of approximately 7,500 patients in the U.S. per year.  According to the 2005 update of the American
Heart Association heart disease and stroke statistics, 865,000 patients will
suffer a new or recurrent heart attack. 
Of these, 7 to 10% will suffer cardiogenic shock and up to 60,000
patients will need some type of cardiac support.

Bridge-to-Transplant

. Bridge-to-transplant devices are used to support patients who
have experienced life-threatening heart disease and are awaiting heart
transplantation. We believe that the market for this


category of device is limited by the size
of the transplant waiting list.  In the
U.S., approximately 3,000 patients are added to the transplant list each year,
and approximately 2,200 patients receive a human heart transplant annually.  We estimate that the potential U.S.
bridge-to-transplant market is, therefore, something less than 3,000 patients
per year.

Bridge-to-Bridge

. These staging devices are used to support patients before or
during application of other therapies and to support patients with failing
hearts being transported to other facilities. At present, for reasons of
specialized care, patients are transported between medical centers with the
assistance of such devices under hospital guidelines. In other cases, patients
initially placed on mechanical support for bridge-to-recovery are moved to a
bridge-to-transplant or destination therapy device.  In addition, there are less invasive,
percutaneous devices which can provide short-term support while clinicians
assess a patient’s heart and determine the appropriate therapeutic strategy. In
the future, staging devices could potentially be used to support and stabilize
heart failure patients during a course of therapy and assessment leading to
potential implantation of a permanent heart assist device or a heart
replacement.  In addition, while bridge-to-recovery
devices are approved and used today to assist heart transplant patients when
rejection occurs, in the future staging devices may be used with transplant
patients who have rejected their donor heart and need life support before
receiving an implantable replacement heart.

At present,
there are two potential therapies other than transplant to which patients might
be bridged in the reasonably near term: a permanent heart assist device,
typically referred to as ventricular assist device (“VAD”) or a permanent heart
replacement device.  The first FDA
approval of a left ventricular assist device, referred to as an LVAD, for
destination therapy occurred in November 2002.  No replacement heart has yet been approved by
the FDA for commercial use.  There is,
therefore, little empirical basis for estimating what proportion of destination
circulatory support device patients will require a bridge device prior to
implantation of a destination device. 
Our estimates of this potential market in the U.S. range from 20,000 to
40,000 patients per year.

Destination Therapy

. Devices intended to be within or attached to patients for their
remaining lives are classified as destination therapies. Destination therapy
devices consist of replacement hearts and permanent assist devices, including
devices that provide partial support to the heart on a permanent basis.

Heart
Replacement

. The
goal of heart replacement, whether with a donor heart or a mechanical device,
is to replace the failing human heart with a viable alternative. Patients with
irreparably damaged hearts who are facing imminent death are potential
candidates for heart replacement provided that their other vital organs remain
viable. The supply of human donor hearts is extremely limited and unlikely to increase
meaningfully, and no device is yet approved for use in these patients. The
AbioCor is the first permanent heart replacement device to commence clinical
trials for this purpose. We believe that tens of thousands of patients per year
might eventually benefit from an implantable replacement heart once it is
proven safe, effective and reliable.  We
filed with the FDA in September 2004 for approval of AbioCor under a
Humanitarian Device Exemption.  A
recommendation is expected from an FDA panel in late June, 2005.

Permanent
Heart Assist

.
Permanent assist devices are being developed to supplement the function of the
diseased heart or to stop or slow the progression of the disease, while leaving
the diseased heart in place. These devices contrast with replacement hearts,
which are intended to replace a severely and irreversibly damaged heart. A
number of companies are developing permanent heart assist devices, some of
which are in clinical trials in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of these assist
devices are in advanced stages of clinical testing and pursuing regulatory
approval. One implantable left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, has been
approved in the U.S. for commercial use as a destination device.

We estimate
the U.S. market for all destination therapy circulatory support devices is
approximately the same as the total device market of between 60,000 and 100,000
patients.  The distribution of those
patients between assist devices and replacement devices is subject to debate
among clinicians and cannot be definitively determined until both types of
devices are clinically available and considerable clinical experience has been
gained.  Major variables include the
percentage of congestive heart failure patients in the group who would require
long term biventricular support, and would therefore require a replacement
heart,


and the percentage of the coronary heart
disease patients in the group who have isolated left-side damage and therefore
might be adequately treated with an LVAD. 
At least two different registries from different manufacturers of
temporary ventricular assist devices in commercial use over a period of more
than ten years indicate an incidence of approximately 50% biventricular support
and 50% univentricular support.  If and
when the technology advances to the point where, in addition to safety and
efficacy, implanted patients can live without constant awareness that their
heart has been replaced or is being permanently assisted, then the potential
use of these devices could increase significantly.

ABIOMED Products and
Products Under Development

Our current commercial heart assist
product line consists of the BVS and AB5000 models. Our primary products under
development are the AbioCor system, a second generation replacement heart, the
AbioCor II, incorporating elements of the Penn State Heart technology, and
enhancements to our heart assist product line. In May 2005, we acquired Impella
CardioSystems AG, based in Aachen, Germany. 
Impella develops, manufactures and markets minimally invasive
cardiovascular support systems for numerous indications in the fields of
cardiology and cardiac surgery.  Each of
these systems consists of various component elements.  Impella has the CE mark for each of its
products and currently markets them throughout Europe.

Heart Assist: The BVS
5000 Biventricular Support System and the AB5000 Circulatory Support System

The BVS was
the first heart assist device capable of assuming the pumping function of the
heart to be approved by the FDA, and is the most widely used heart assist
device today, with thousands of patients supported to date. It is a
bridge-to-recovery device designed to provide a patient’s failing heart with
full circulatory assistance while allowing the heart to rest, heal and recover
its function. The BVS can support the left, right or both ventricles of the
heart. The average age of patients supported with the BVS is 53; however the
BVS has been used to support patients as young as 8 and as old as 86 years old.

The BVS is
most frequently used in patients whose hearts fail to recover function
immediately following heart surgery. The FDA approved the BVS for use with
these post-surgical patients in November 1992. In 1996, the FDA approved
use of the BVS for all other categories of post-surgical patients with
potentially reversible heart failure. In 1997, the FDA approved use of the BVS
on patients who, prior to BVS insertion, are non-surgical patients with abrupt
heart failure as a result of viral attack of the heart or certain heart
attacks, expanding its use to the temporary treatment of all patients with
potentially reversible heart failure. We market and sell the BVS system in
Europe under a CE mark and in 2001 we received regulatory approval to market
and sell the BVS in Japan.

The AB5000
is a new heart assist product approved for commercial distribution during
fiscal 2004.  It incorporates a number of
features to facilitate temporary patient mobility within the hospital, patient
transport between hospitals, and improved ease of use for caregivers.  These features include a smaller and more
mobile control console incorporating computer-based technology, a blood pump
geometry and design that allows paracorporeal placement, and a simpler and more
intuitive user interface.  In addition,
the AB5000 console is designed to serve as a flexible and upgradeable platform
for future blood pump product enhancements to address broadened patient
populations for longer periods of support subject to regulatory approval.

The BVS and
AB5000 are the only devices that the FDA has approved for the temporary
treatment of all categories of patients with failing but potentially
recoverable hearts. Both the BVS and AB5000 systems consist of the following
components:

•

Single-use external blood pumps, which provide pumping of blood
for the left, right or both sides of a patient’s heart and are designed to
emulate the function of the natural heart;


•

Cannulae, which are specially designed tubes used to connect the
blood pumps to a patient’s heart; and

•

A computer-controlled pneumatic drive and control console, which
automatically adjusts the pumping rate to meet the basic needs of the
patient.  The BVS console can control only
the BVS blood pump.  The AB5000 console
can be used to control the BVS and AB5000 blood pumps.

The
integration of the cannulae, blood pumps and console creates an “external heart”
system with the ability to reduce the load on the heart, provide pulsatile
blood flow to vital organs and allow the heart muscles time to rest and
recover. Both the BVS and the AB5000 are designed to be easy to use and do not
require a specially trained technician to constantly monitor or adjust the
pumping parameters.

These
products are designed to facilitate the recovery of patients’ hearts as quickly
as possible. Historically, patients who recover under BVS support typically
stabilize in a period of less than one week. It generally takes three to five
days for the damaged but recoverable heart muscle to restore its function in a
post-cardiotomy patient. While the BVS has been used to support some patients
for weeks or months, the BVS is not intended nor approved for long-term use.
The BVS, although it is an external ventricular assist device, serves a
different function than bridge-to-transplant devices, which are intended for
long-term use by patients awaiting a heart transplant.  In contrast, the AB5000, while its current
regulatory approval is identical to that of the BVS, is designed to allow for
longer periods of operation, and has already demonstrated its reliability for
extended periods in the test laboratory. 
It is our intention to seek regulatory approval of expanded indications
for use for the AB5000.

The BVS and
AB5000 are most frequently used to support patients who have undergone
open-heart surgery, when the heart cannot be successfully restarted and weaned
off the heart-lung machine used in surgery. Each can assume the full pumping
function of the heart for these patients while reducing certain risks
associated with extended support on the heart-lung machine, including bleeding,
strokes and blood cell damage. The traditional therapy for these patients has
been the combined use of drugs and intra-aortic balloon pumps. Intra-aortic
balloon pumps are capable of providing limited enhancement to the pumping
function of a failing heart. Despite the availability of such therapy, many
thousands of these patients die each year.

Other
categories of patients who can be supported by the BVS or the AB5000 include
those suffering from viral myocarditis, a viral infection of the heart. For
these patients, the devices assume the full pumping function of the heart,
allowing the patient’s immune system to defend against the virus. Other uses
include supporting patients following failed heart transplants, supporting
heart attack patients while their status and therapeutic options are evaluated,
and supporting the right ventricle of a patient’s heart in conjunction with the
implantation of a device to assist the left ventricle.

Any hospital
performing open-chest heart surgery may use the BVS or the AB5000. There are
approximately 900 of these hospitals in the U.S. and more than 1,000 such
hospitals outside the U.S. Over 650 medical centers in the U.S. have purchased
the BVS, including 70% of the major U.S. centers that perform more than 500
heart surgeries annually. In marketing the BVS, we are focusing on providing
disposable blood pumps to existing customers. 
AB5000 marketing efforts were initially focused on introducing the
system in the largest cardiothoracic surgical centers through sales of consoles
and sales of blood pumps.  Moving
forward, we are focusing on upgrading the BVS installed base to the AB5000
console, enabling more centers to benefit from the flexibility and
upgradeability of the AB5000 console platform.

The AbioCor
Implantable Replacement Heart

The AbioCor
is a battery-powered totally implantable replacement heart system, designed to
operate without wires or any other material penetrating the patient’s
skin.  Implantation is achieved in the
space vacated by the removal of a patient’s diseased ventricles, where it will
take over the full pumping function of the heart. The AbioCor is intended for
use as destination therapy by patients with irreparably damaged hearts who are
at risk of imminent death but whose other vital organs remain viable.


In 1988, we
began to receive directed funding for AbioCor development and testing from the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institutes, known as the NHLBI.  We maintained this competitively-funded
support through the research phase of our AbioCor development program by
achieving various designated milestones. Cumulatively, the NHLBI has provided
over $20 million toward of the development of the AbioCor.

Design of the AbioCor

.  The AbioCor system
consists of the following principal components:

•

A thoracic unit, or “replacement heart,” which includes two
artificial ventricles with their associated valves and a hydraulic pumping
system. The unit weighs approximately two pounds and provides complete blood
circulation to the lungs and the rest of the body. The ventricles and their
associated valves have seamless surfaces made from our blood-contacting
material, Angioflex, and special geometries with flow patterns designed to
reduce the risk of blood cell damage and blood clots. Our current configuration
of the thoracic unit is sized for patients with relatively large chest
cavities. We are also developing future generation replacement hearts sized to
fit the majority of adults who might benefit from a replacement heart.

•

An implantable rechargeable internal battery allows the AbioCor to
operate without any external power supply for limited periods of time.

•

A microprocessor-based internal electronic device, or “controller”
controls and monitors the thoracic unit and provides radio communication with
an external monitor affording patients, clinicians and caregivers the
opportunity for real-time information on its operating status.

•

An across-the-skin, or transcutaneous energy transmission system,
which eliminates the need for wires penetrating the patient’s skin and the
inherent associated risks of infection. It transfers the power to operate the
AbioCor system and to recharge the implantable battery without tethering the
patient to an external drive console. This system includes an internal energy
coil that is implanted beneath the skin and an external coil that is aligned in
proximity to the internal coil but resides outside the skin. The external coil
emits power that is received by the internal coil.

•

A patient-carried rechargeable battery pack and monitor is
designed to be pulled by the patient like a small briefcase. These components
supply primary power to the system, allow patient mobility, provide basic
system alarm information, and recharge the implanted back-up battery as needed.


The AbioCor
design is intended to preserve life and to restore the quality of a patient’s
life to an acceptable level.  Restoration
of the quality of a patient’s life means that the patient should be able to
return to a comfortable lifestyle, free from pain, with good mental acuity and
an ability to carry out everyday activities. Among the quality-of-life features
of the AbioCor design are quiet heart valves, no penetration of the skin, no
tethering to a large external drive console and no need for immuno-suppression
therapies. The AbioCor system is designed for both low maintenance and low
patient involvement. However, during our ongoing initial clinical trial of the
first generation AbioCor, patients have largely remained under sustained
medical supervision in the hospital and have typically used a portable
monitoring device in lieu of the less-burdensome patient-carried external
battery pack and electronics until such time as their health has recovered and
a greater degree of independence has been demonstrated.

We have also
created tools and methods intended to make the AbioCor system easier to
implant. These tools include quick-connectors for attachment of the AbioCor to
the human anatomy and a virtual surgery software tool to allow for the
simulated implant of the AbioCor into a three-dimensional anatomical
computerized model of a particular patient prior to opening that patient’s
chest.

Initial Clinical
Trial

. In our initial
clinical trial we were seeking to determine whether the first generation
AbioCor can effectively and safely extend life with acceptable quality of life
for patients who are otherwise likely to die within thirty days and who have no
other life-saving option. The results of this initial fifteen patient trial
will allow us to better assess our status with regard to obtaining regulatory
approval to commercially market and sell the AbioCor for an initial subset of
patients in the U.S.

In January 2001,
we received FDA permission under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to
begin the initial human clinical trial. Under the terms of the IDE, we planned
to implant up to a total of fifteen patients divided into three groups of five
each, with expansion to each successive group of five patients if the 60-day
experience of patients with the first generation AbioCor was satisfactory to
the FDA.  Patients could be included in
this initial clinical trial only if they had biventricular heart failure, were
more than eighteen years old, were unresponsive to any other existing
therapies, were ineligible for heart transplantation and were sufficiently
large for the first generation AbioCor to fit and operate adequately.  Patients were excluded from the clinical
trial if their heart failure had a significant potential of being reversible,
if they did not have a high likelihood of dying within the next 30 days, if
they were pregnant, had serious psychiatric illness or an inadequate social
support system.  Patients were also
excluded if they were suffering from other severe irreversible non-cardiac
medical ailments.

As of May 2005, a total of 14 patients have participated
in the initial AbioCor clinical trial. 
Twelve of those patients were supported for some period of time, and 2
died just subsequent to surgery.  The
duration of support for the 12 patients supported by the AbioCor has ranged
from 53 to 512 days, with an average support duration of approximately 5
months.  In a cumulative total of
approximately 5 patient-years of support, the mechanical operation of the first
generation AbioCor system has been highly reliable, providing appropriate and
predictable circulatory support.  One
device experienced wearout of one component after nearly 17 months of
operation.  This was within the predicted
range of durability for the current first generation device, and the process
was tracked by the clinical team and by ABIOMED’s engineers, who were able to
offer the patient an opportunity, which was declined, for a replacement
AbioCor.  There was also one device
stoppage in one patient, the causes of which were determined and corrective
actions implemented.  None of the
patients has experienced device-related infection or sepsis.  Some patients have experienced strokes that
led to withdrawal of support.  Strokes
are a continuing risk for any circulatory support system, and may be impacted
by surgical technique, device characteristics and/or patient management.  Potential causes of the strokes will continue
to be monitored and addressed, primarily through efforts to identify and
facilitate optimal blood flow at the point of surgical attachment of the
AbioCor to the atria of the natural heart. Adequate anticoagulation management
has been a challenge for most of these sickest of heart failure patients.

Five of 12 supported
patients were ambulatory.  Four patients
had excursions outside of the hospital. 
Two patients were discharged to facilities near the hospitals as an
intermediate step toward final discharge to


home.  These
patients were able to go to restaurants, attend shows, sporting events, and
religious services, and visit with family and friends.  Such activities have been conducted mostly
with wearable external components allowing for freedom and mobility.  Two patients were discharged from the
hospital with one returning home.

Encouraged
by the results of the initial clinical trials, we applied

for initial
FDA market approval for the AbioCor to treat a defined subset of irreversible
end-stage heart failure patients under a Humanitarian Device Exemption

(HDE). This would allow implantation of the AbioCor in up to 4,000
U.S. patients a year. As of May 31, 2005, an expert panel of cardiovascular
surgeons and cardiologists are reviewing the HDE application and a recommendation
is expected by June 23, 2005.

While the
AbioCor is designed as a permanent replacement for the failing heart, the
AbioCor as it exists today is a first-generation device that will likely
require improvement over time to incorporate feedback from its clinical use.
The patients who will be initially treated with the AbioCor will be relatively
large framed adults who are near death and for whom the AbioCor represents the
only potential viable alternative to death. We have tested the AbioCor
extensively. The results of such testing were part of our IDE submission to the
FDA from which we gained permission to commence initial clinical trials. We
believe that for patients ill enough to qualify for the initial clinical trial,
the first generation AbioCor presents the best alternative to potentially
extend their lives and to provide them with an acceptable quality of life.
However, we understand that this patient category represents only a fraction of
the potential patients who might benefit annually from the AbioCor. Our
clinical and regulatory strategy of continuing to improve the AbioCor based on
clinical experience is intended to allow us to demonstrate that the AbioCor can
provide patients with a reasonable quality of life for sustained periods of
time. We believe that demonstration of this capability is needed for eventual
use of the product in end-stage heart failure patients who are not as ill as is
required to qualify for our initial clinical trial.

Cost Effectiveness

. We are developing the AbioCor with the intent to eventually
offer a cost-effective treatment for end-stage heart failure patients. In
addition, the AbioCor has the potential to allow patients an opportunity to
return to productive lives. This would allow the medical system to save money
by discharging the patient from the hospital and allowing the person to become
productive and lead a reasonably normal life.

If the
safety, effectiveness and durability of the AbioCor are clinically demonstrated
for multiple-year durations, it has the potential to be less expensive than
heart transplantation over a five-year period. One reason for this reduced cost
is that recipients of a mechanical replacement heart are not expected to need
immuno-suppression drugs. The blood and tissue contacting portions of the
AbioCor are constructed of inert materials, which are not expected to elicit a
response from a patient’s immune system. Other cost savings could result
because the patients can receive a replacement heart sooner and would not
require extensive tests and biopsies to assess donor heart compatibility. While
recipients of the AbioCor will need to purchase new batteries periodically, we
anticipate that the annual comparative cost of battery purchases will be
significantly less than the cost of immuno-suppression drugs required by donor
heart recipients.  AbioCor patients do
require common and relatively inexpensive anticoagulation drugs on an ongoing
basis

While
developing the AbioCor, we introduced the BVS, a temporary heart-assist device,
which is currently being sold in the U.S. and international markets, and more
recently the AB5000. Certain key elements of the technology developed for the
AbioCor, especially the blood contacting material, Angioflex, have been
clinically tested and are currently in commercial use in these heart assist
products.  The AbioCor blood pumping
technology developed and refined over more than two decades has found a
commercial application in the AB5000 Ventricle. 
In addition, our heart assist business has enabled us to develop
significant experience in areas such as research and development,
manufacturing, regulatory compliance, clinical support and sales and marketing.
We believe our experience in these areas will provide us with a competitive
advantage in commercializing the AbioCor.

Ongoing Development

.

The AbioCor is subject
to ongoing development and refinements. 
The first generation AbioCor does not yet meet our longer-term goal of
five years of operational reliability. In the United States its current size
fits less than 50% of adult males and less than 20% of adult females.  External


elements of the system are subject to
ongoing refinement to improve ease of use for clinicians and quality of life
for patients and their families.  The
experience gained in the initial AbioCor clinical trial is invaluable in
guiding these ongoing development efforts.

Our
development of the smaller, second-generation AbioCor II is in the animal
testing phase.  The AbioCor II
incorporates features of both the first-generation AbioCor and the Penn State
Heart. We acquired the technology rights to the Penn State Heart in 2000.  Similar to the AbioCor, the development of
the Penn State Heart was supported by significant funding from the NHLBI.  The AbioCor and the Penn State Heart were the
only two replacement heart programs that achieved the technological progress
needed to qualify for the final pre-clinical rounds of funding from NHLBI. In
addition to its size, approximately 30% smaller than AbioCor, AbioCor II has a
reliability goal of five years of operation.

The Impella Recover
2.5/5.0 Micro Blood Pumps

In May 2005,
we acquired Impella CardioSystems AG of Aachen, Germany. In so doing, we added
to our heart assist product portfolio Impella’s Recover System circulatory
assist devices. The Recover 2.5 and 5.0 are the world’s smallest, minimally
invasive, high-performance micro blood pumps. These devices, designed for use
by cardiologists in the cardiac catheterization lab, can be inserted
percutaneously into patients to provide left ventricle support to patients with
AMI, including those suffering cardiogenic shock. Currently, the Impella
Recover devices have CE marks and are not yet approved by the FDA for sale in
the U.S.

Other Products and
Technologies

We are using
the technology and know-how derived from the AbioCor, BVS, AB5000 and Impella
products in the research and development of other potential cardiovascular
products. We are also using our experience and commitment to this field to
evaluate potential collaborative arrangements relating to third-party
technologies and products.

Other new
technologies are in various stages of research, development or evaluation, and
include passive and active heart wraps as well as specialized implantable and
external heart assist devices. Some are technologies developed earlier and
placed on hold, such as an advanced intra-aortic balloon pump, the SupraCor. In
addition, research and development activities under our product development
programs incorporate certain technologies that have potential as separate
spin-off products. Examples include implantable monitoring systems with remote
transmission capability software for virtual surgery, non-invasive power
transmission systems, and external monitoring systems.

Research and Product
Development

As of May
31, 2005, our research and development staff, including those employees who
joined us from Impella, consisted of 84 professional and technical personnel,
including 9 individuals in design assurance and a total of 35 engineers, many
with advanced degrees, covering disciplines such as electronics, mechanics,
software, reliability engineering, fluid mechanics, physics, materials and
physiology.

Our research
and development efforts are focused on mechanical heart assist and heart
replacement, and the continued enhancement of our product offerings.
Interaction continues with the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory
agencies to obtain the necessary clearances and approvals for our products.
Sophisticated but established tools, such as three-dimensional computer-aided
design systems are used to permit smooth transition of new designs from
research to product development and into manufacturing. We have substantial
expertise in electro-mechanical systems, cardiac physiology and experimental
surgery, blood-material interactions, fluid mechanics and hemodynamics,
internal and external electronic hardware, battery technology, software and
plastics processing. Our expertise has been primarily focused on addressing
challenges associated with the safe and effective pumping of blood.


We expended
$20.6 million, $14.3 million and $13.5 million on research and development in
fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 
Since our inception, U.S. government agencies, particularly the NHLBI,
have provided significant support to our product development efforts when such
products are in their early stages of research and development. As of March 31,
2005, our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was $0.3
million. All of these contracts and grants contain provisions making them
terminable at the convenience of the government.

Sales, Clinical
Support, Marketing and Field Service

We believe
that the sales, clinical support, marketing and field service teams established
for our heart assist product line and the relationships developed with existing
customers will be instrumental not only in continuing to expand BVS and AB5000
usage and sales, but also in launching heart replacement products such as the AbioCor
and the AbioCor II and the minimally invasive ventricular assist products
gained through the recent acquisition of Impella CardioSystems, AG, once
appropriate regulatory approvals are achieved.

The BVS and
AB5000 are sold in the U.S. through direct sales and clinical support teams. As
of May 31, 2005, our worldwide sales, clinical support, marketing and
field service teams included 58 full-time employees. The acquisition of Impella
in May 2005 added 5 clinical sales and service employees based in Aachen,
Germany. Also in May 2005, two vice presidents of sales and two additional
sales positions were added in the U.S. 
In the year ahead, we plan to increase our sales and clinical support
personnel.

Currently, our
sales force primarily focuses on increasing sales from expanded usage of
disposable blood pumps and ventricles by our large installed base of customers
as well as from initial and upgrade sales to new and existing customers.  Our clinical support group focuses on
training and educating new and existing customers in order to help improve
clinical outcomes.  We believe the
efforts of our clinical support group contribute significantly to the number of
lives saved by physicians using our products. This, in turn, promotes usage and
reorders of single-use BVS blood pumps and AB5000 ventricles.  We believe the reputation and customer
relationships of our sales and support teams, strengthened by our best
practices learned through experiences at leading heart centers, will be key
assets for the introduction of future products such as the AbioCor, Impella
products, and other products under development (once appropriate regulatory
approvals are achieved).

Building on
our experience in the U.S., in recent years we have expanded our international
sales efforts for our heart assist products and in preparation for future
availability of AbioCor and Impella products (once appropriate regulatory
approvals are achieved).  We conduct our
international sales efforts through distributors and by selling directly in selected
European markets through ABIOMED B.V., our wholly-owned subsidiary located in
The Netherlands.  As of May 31, 2005, we
have signed international sales and distribution agreements with: Japan; China;
Australia; Canada; and Latin America.  We
also utilize distributors in Spain; Italy; Greece; Turkey; and the Middle East.

Manufacturing

We have over
15 years of experience in the manufacture of mechanical circulatory support
consoles, blood pumps, cannulae and related accessories.  The manufacture of our BVS and AB5000 blood
pumps and consoles, and the pilot manufacturing of our AbioCor system
components, includes assembly, testing and quality control.  All of the AbioCor systems manufactured are
being used for our testing and other investigational purposes.  None of the AbioCor systems manufactured are
currently available or approved for commercial sale.  Key blood-contacting components for the blood
pumps, including valves and bladders, are manufactured from our proprietary
Angioflex polymer. The production of the AbioCor is based on some processes
that are similar to the processes used for the BVS.  We produce the majority of the AbioCor blood
contacting components in our facility and all such components are assembled
in-house. A majority of the metallic mechanical parts and batteries used to
produce the AbioCor are contract-manufactured or purchased.  We contract with third parties to manufacture
our AB5000 and AbioCor consoles. Depending on the size and design of cannulae,
they are either purchased or manufactured by us.


Impella
CardioSystems has over ten years of experience manufacturing microminiature
rotary blood pumps, control consoles and related accessories.  Impella’s subcomponents are procured from
various suppliers.  The rotary blood
pumps are then assembled and tested at Impella in a clean room controlled
environment using proprietary and patented processes.  Control console components, including custom
circuit board assemblies, power modules, molded enclosures and miscellaneous
electronic components are purchased from outside suppliers.  Finished control consoles are assembled and
tested in-house at Impella.

As of May
31, 2005, a total of 98 employees were engaged in BVS and AB5000 manufacturing
and AbioCor pilot manufacturing. 
Manufacturing and pilot manufacturing operations are further supported
by an additional 18 people devoted to quality assurance and documentation and
by 11 people in materials management and purchasing.  We also have 13 employees located in Aachen,
Germany supporting manufacturing documentation, materials management and
purchasing for the Impella Recover blood pump and console products.

We believe
our existing manufacturing facilities give us the physical capacity to produce
sufficient quantities of BVS and AB5000 disposable blood pumps and cannulae and
Impella Recover 2.5 and 5.0 micro blood pumps to meet market demand for the
foreseeable future. Our BVS and AB5000 manufacturing area is ISO9001 certified
and operates under the FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements set forth
in the current quality system regulations, known as QSR. Our AbioCor
manufacturing areas are ISO9001 certified, and we are taking steps towards
ensuring that our AbioCor manufacturing area will be QSR compliant for purposes
of eventual commercial distribution of AbioCor, subject to regulatory
approvals.  Raw material for processing
of Angioflex, a material critical to our products, is purchased from a single
source, and the company typically maintains inventory to last in excess of five
years.

Proprietary Rights,
Patents and Know-How

We have
developed significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our
business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on
trade secret laws, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and confidentiality
agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only limited
protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent
proprietary information, gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such
technology without our approval.

A
substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the
AbioCor, the Penn State Heart, the BVS and the AB5000 is in the form of trade
secrets, rather than patents. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary
knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees,
consultants and other parties. We cannot assure that our trade secrets will not
become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.

As of June 11, 2005, we own 47 U.S. patents, including
17 related to the AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart and two related to the
BVS 5000 Bi-Ventricular Support System. 
Additionally, we have an exclusive worldwide license to 10 U.S. patents
related to the Penn State Heart.  These
57 U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from June 21, 2005, to January
25, 2025.

Through our acquisition of Impella CardioSystems AG, we
own 12 U.S. patents and 37 foreign patents covering Impella’s commercial
products and products under development.

Our patents may not provide us
with competitive advantages. They may also be challenged by third parties. Our
pending or future patent applications may not be approved. The patents of
others may render our patents obsolete or otherwise have an adverse effect on
our ability to conduct business. Because foreign patents may afford less
protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately protect our proprietary
information.

The medical
device industry is characterized by a large number of patents and by frequent
and substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies
could infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. If third parties
successfully assert infringement or other claims against us, we may not be able
to sell our products. In addition, patent or intellectual property disputes or
litigation may be costly, result in product development delays, or divert the
efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. If any such
disputes or litigation arise, we may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing
arrangement. However, such an arrangement may not be available on commercially
acceptable terms, if at


all. We may decide, in the alternative, to
litigate the claims or to design around the patented or otherwise proprietary
technology.

The
government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose technical data
developed under government contracts that supported the development of some of
our products. We retain the right to obtain patents on any inventions developed
under those contracts (subject to a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
royalty-free license to the government), provided we follow prescribed
procedures.

Competition

Competition
among providers of treatments for the failing heart is intense and subject to
rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. We
compete with companies developing or marketing cardiovascular products that
have substantially greater or broader financial, product development, sales and
marketing resources and experience than ABIOMED. These competitors may develop
superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices.
Moreover, improvements in current or new technologies may make them technically
equivalent or superior to our products in addition to providing cost or other
advantages. Other advances in medical technology, biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for our products
or render those products obsolete.

No fully
implantable replacement heart is commercially available today. We are aware of
other heart replacement device research efforts in the U.S., Canada, Europe and
Japan, but are not aware of any plans for any other totally implantable
replacement heart to commence clinical trials in the U.S. or anywhere in the
world. In March 2004, the FDA’s Circulatory Systems Devices Panel
recommended approval of Syncardia Systems’ CardioWest Total Artificial Heart for
use as a bridge to transplantation in cardiac transplant-eligible candidates at
risk of imminent death from non-reversible biventricular failure.  The FDA approved the recommendation in October of
2004.  Unlike our AbioCor, the CardioWest
heart is not fully implantable.  For this
reason, we do not view it as a direct competitor to the AbioCor.  We believe that if and when other implantable
replacement hearts are available, our AbioCor will compete with them based on
quality-of-life advantages, cost effectiveness, device reliability, clinical
support and customer relationships.

In addition
to the developers of implantable replacement hearts, there are a number of
companies—including Thoratec Corporation, World Heart Corporation, MicroMed
Technology, and Ventracor—which are developing permanent heart assist products,
including implantable LVADs and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices,
that may address markets that overlap with certain segments of the markets
targeted by ABIOMED’s products. We believe that implantable replacement hearts,
LVADs and other VADs, if developed and proven effective for destination
therapy, will generally be used to address the needs of different patient
populations, with an overlap for certain segments of the heart failure
population. We believe that there is a need for both implantable LVADs and
implantable replacement hearts as destination therapies, and that when both
technologies demonstrate the required reliability, surgeons will make decisions
based upon the specific needs and conditions of individual patients.

In addition
to devices being developed for patients in need of heart replacement, several
companies and institutions have been for many years investigating
xenotransplantation, the transplantation of a heart from another species, as a
potential therapy. Most notably, some developers are investigating the use of
genetically engineered pig hearts as an alternative source of donor hearts.
This technology remains in its formative stage and subject to a number of significant
challenges, including controlling elevated immunologic reactions leading to
heightened rejection problems between cross-species grafting and major concerns
for cross-species disease transmission to the recipient and the public at
large. We believe that this technology remains in the research phase.

Research is also
being conducted to develop gene and cell therapy as potential to reverse the
disease process or to supplant diseased heart cells.  We believe that the key research activities
in this area, while promising, remain in the formative stage.

The BVS and
AB5000 systems can assume the full pumping function of the heart. The FDA
approved these systems as bridge-to-recovery devices for the treatment of all
patients with potentially


reversible heart failure. They compete
with a temporary cardiac assist device from Thoratec Corporation, which is also
capable of assuming the full pumping function of the heart and is today
approved for post-cardiotomy support. The Thoratec device was originally
approved for bridge-to-transplant and bridge-to-transplant continues to be the
primary use of the device. In addition, the BVS and AB5000 compete with other
blood pumps, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps (Datascope, Arrow
International) and centrifugal pumps, that are used in medical centers for a
variety of applications but which are limited to either providing partial
pumping support of failing hearts, or are non-pulsatile, or are not recommended
for the duration of support generally required for bridge-to-recovery. We are
aware of one other company, Levitronix, that is conducting clinical trials in
the U.S. with a device that may compete with our current heart assist products
in some applications. Approval by the FDA of products that compete directly
with our products could increase competitive pricing and other pressures. We
believe that we can compete with such products based on cost, clinical utility
and customer relations.

Our
customers frequently have limited budgets. As a result, our products compete
against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies for these limited
funds. Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance our
existing products, to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer
requirements, and to achieve market acceptance. We believe that important
competitive factors with respect to the development and commercialization of
our products include the relative speed with which we can develop products, establish
clinical utility, complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes,
obtain reimbursement, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the
market.

Third-Party
Reimbursement

We sell our
current products and intend to sell most of our potential products under
development to medical institutions. Medical institutions and their physicians
typically seek reimbursement for the use of these products from third-party
payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers and managed
care organizations. As a result, market acceptance of our current and proposed
products may depend in large part on the extent to which reimbursement is
available to medical institutions and physicians for use of our products.

Coverage and
the level of payment provided by U.S. and foreign third-party payers varies
according to a number of factors, including the medical procedure, payer,
location, outcome, and cost. In the U.S., many private health care insurance
carriers follow the lead of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS), which establishes guidelines for the coverage of procedures, services
and medical equipment and the payment of health care providers treating
Medicare patients. The amount that Medicare pays a medical institution for
in-patient care of Medicare patients is based on the Diagnosis Related Group
(DRG) to which a specific hospitalization is assigned for payment purposes,
without regard to the actual costs of the specific hospitalization.  AB5000 and BVS products are currently
reimbursed under DRG 525 when implanted, one of the five highest paying DRGs
available from CMS. Physicians bill separately for the procedures that they
perform. Internationally, healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly.
In certain countries, medical center budgets are fixed regardless of levels of
patient treatment. In other countries, such as Germany and Australia, a
structure similar to that of the U.S. has been implemented.  Impella products are not yet reimbursed in
the U.S. prior to FDA approval, however are reimbursed in parts of Europe.

Reimbursement
levels have not yet been established for our products under development,
including the AbioCor. Prior to approving coverage for new medical devices,
most third-party payers require evidence that the product has received FDA
approval in the U.S. or clearance for marketing, is safe and effective and not
experimental or investigational, and is medically necessary and appropriate for
the specific patient for whom the product is being used. Increasing numbers of
third-party payers require evidence that the procedures in which the products
are used, as well as the products themselves, are cost-effective. Heart
transplantation currently qualifies for reimbursement, as does bridge-to-transplant
treatment with implantable and percutaneous VADs. Comparatively, we believe
that when the AbioCor product reaches maturity, it should cost less over a
five-year period than heart transplantation today. We believe that these
factors should benefit the AbioCor when our customers begin to seek
reimbursement for it from third-party payers. However, we cannot assure that
the AbioCor or our other products under development will meet the criteria


for coverage and reimbursement or that
third-party payers will reimburse physicians and medical institutions at levels
sufficient to encourage the widespread use of the products.

Government Regulation

Clinical
trials, manufacture and sale of our products and products under development,
including the BVS, AB5000, AbioCor and AbioCor II are, or will be, subject to
regulation by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies.
Noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other
things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products,
total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant
marketing approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal
prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or
refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by ABIOMED.

U.S. Clinical Use
Regulations

.  In the United States, our BVS and AB5000
heart assist systems are classified as Class III medical devices under FDA
rules, as is the AbioCor. In the U.S., medical devices are classified into one
of three classes (i.e., Class I, II or III) based on the controls deemed
necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class
III medical devices are subject to the most rigorous regulation. Class III
devices, which are typically life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable
devices, or new devices that have been found not to be substantially equivalent
to legally marketed devices, must generally receive pre-market approval (PMA)
by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are also
subject to some of the requirements applicable to Class I and Class II devices,
including general controls, such as labeling, pre-market notification,
performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and
adherence to Quality System Regulations (QSR) requirements, which include
testing, control and documentation requirements.

A PMA
application is the most common route to obtain permission to market and sell a
Class III device in the U.S. for a particular indication.  A PMA application must be supported by valid
scientific evidence, which typically includes extensive information including
relevant bench tests, laboratory and animal studies and clinical trial data to
demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device. The PMA application
also must contain a complete description of the device and its components, a
detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to
manufacture the device, and the proposed labeling, advertising literature and
training materials. By regulation, the FDA has 180 days to review the PMA
application, and during that time an advisory committee may be called on to evaluate
the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. Advisory committee
reviews often occur over a significantly protracted period, and a number of
devices for which FDA approval has been sought have never been cleared for
marketing. In addition, modifications to a device that is the subject of an
approved PMA, or to its labeling or manufacturing process, may require the
submission of PMA supplements or new PMAs and approval by the FDA.

The FDA also
provides that certain devices can be distributed under a Humanitarian Device
Exemption (HDE) rather than a PMA. In order for a device to be eligible for an
HDE, a qualifying target patient population of less than 4,000 patients per
year for which there is currently no other available therapy must be approved
by the FDA.  The FDA’s approval of an HDE
to treat that qualifying patient population then requires demonstration that
the device is safe for its intended application, that it is potentially
effective, and that the probable benefits outweigh the associated risks.  Adoption of an HDE device within a hospital
is subject to the hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.  The regulatory hurdle for an HDE, while far
from negligible, is therefore significantly less burdensome than that for a PMA.  A device distributed under an HDE may be
sold, but compensation may not exceed recovery of costs, including cumulative
research and development costs as well as the costs of manufacturing and
distribution.

If clinical
trials of a device are required in order to obtain FDA approval, the sponsor of
the trial is required to file an Investigational Device Exemption, known as an
IDE, application prior to commencing clinical trials. The IDE application must
be supported by data, which typically include the results of extensive device
bench testing, animal testing performed in conformance with Good Laboratory
Practices, and formal laboratory testing and documentation in accordance with
appropriate design controls and scientific


justification. If the FDA approves the IDE
application, and the IRBs at the institutions at which the clinical trials will
be performed approve the clinical protocol and related materials, clinical
trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific
number of patients, as approved by the FDA. Sponsors of clinical trials are
permitted to charge for investigational devices distributed in the course of
the study provided that compensation does not exceed recovery of the costs of
manufacture, research, development and handling. An IDE supplement must be
submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make
a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness
or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.

In November 1992,
the FDA approved our PMA for the BVS. In 1996 and 1997, the FDA approved the
use of the BVS for additional indications, expanding its use to the treatment
of all patients with potentially reversible heart failure. In April 2003
the AB5000 Circulatory Support System Console was approved under a PMA
Supplement, and in September 2003 a PMA supplement for the AB5000 blood
pump was approved.

The AbioCor
is classified as a Class III device and therefore is subject to a stringent
regulatory approval and monitoring process. In January 2001, the FDA
granted an IDE providing us with regulatory permission to commence the initial
clinical trial of the AbioCor. The initial clinical trial, which began on July 2,
2001, is subject to periodic review and to the readiness of each collaborating
medical center, including training of its surgical and post-operative care
teams and approval of the clinical trial protocol by the hospital’s IRB. The
trial was undertaken with patients who, despite all available therapies, had an
extremely high probability of death within thirty days due to heart failure.

We are
seeking initial FDA approval of the AbioCor for a limited category of
indications and patients through an HDE, and subsequent approval via PMA for
additional indications and patient populations. After the initial regulatory
approval, we will need to complete additional clinical testing and request
supplemental approvals for additional indications and broader marketing claims.
If we obtain approval of the AbioCor in this manner, the FDA may initially
impose restrictions on use of the AbioCor. Nevertheless, we believe that this
phased approach will permit us to obtain initial marketing approval for the
AbioCor more quickly than if we were to seek a broader approval from the
outset.

U.S. Manufacturing
and Sales Regulation

. Any
devices, including the BVS and AB5000 circulatory assist systems, which we
manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals, are subject
to continuing regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
Manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the U.S. are required to
adhere to QSR requirements and must also comply with Medical Devices Reporting,
or MDR, which requires that a firm report to the FDA any incident in which its
product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in
which its product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it would
be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling and
promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain
circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy
prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. We are
subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for
compliance with QSR and MDR requirements, as well as other applicable
regulations.

International
Regulation

. We
are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which we
sell our products. Many of the regulations applicable to our products in these
countries are similar to those of the FDA. 
We believe that foreign regulations relating to the manufacture and sale
of medical devices are becoming more stringent. The European Union requires
that medical devices such as the BVS and AB5000 comply with the Medical Device
Directive, which includes quality system and CE certification
requirements.  The BVS, AB5000 and Impella
Recover temporary cardiac assist products comply with the Medical Devices
Directive, are CE marked and available for sale in the European Union.  We have obtained the requisite regulatory
approvals for sale of the BVS in other foreign countries, as well. In the
European Union, implantable devices, such as the AbioCor, must comply with the
Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, known as AIMDD, which includes
quality system requirements, in order to obtain CE certification.  The scope of our quality system specifically
includes the design, development, and manufacture of cardiac


replacement systems, but obtaining CE
certification under the AIMDD for the AbioCor or other implantable products
under development may be difficult, costly and time-consuming.

to markets for our products and trends in sales, gross profit and anticipated
expense levels, as well as other statements, including words such as “may,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “expect,” and “intend” and other similar
expressions constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties, and
our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in
the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such
differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under “Risk
Factors” as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this Report.

Overview

We are a
leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed to
safely and effectively assist, recover or replace the pumping function of the
failing heart. Our AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart, the world’s first
battery-powered implantable replacement heart system, was submitted to the FDA
for limited commercial approval under an HDE in September 2004.  The FDA has subsequently announced that it
will convene a special expert panel of cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists
on June 23, 2005 to review and potentially recommend approval for the
groundbreaking technologies and clinical trial data behind the AbioCor.  The AbioCor, the development of which follows
decades of fundamental and applied research, development and testing, is
intended to extend life and provide an improved quality of life for end-stage
acute and chronic heart failure patients.

We currently
manufacture and sell two models of our temporary heart assist product.  The BVS 5000 Biventricular Support System was
the first device approved by the FDA as a bridge-to-recovery device for
temporary treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable
hearts.  The BVS system has an installed
base of approximately 900 consoles located in approximately 650 medical centers
in the United States, including 70% of all medical centers that perform more
than 500 heart surgeries annually.  The
BVS system has also been placed in more than 100 medical centers outside the United
States, primarily in Europe.  In marketing
the BVS, we are focusing on providing disposable blood pumps to existing
customers.  Our newer AB5000 Circulatory
Support System is a heart assist product model, designed to provide enhanced
patient mobility within and between centers, to facilitate patient ambulation,
and to provide enhanced features and ease of use for caregivers.  In April 2003, we introduced the AB5000
console, a new console that will serve as a platform for ongoing and future
blood pump product line enhancements to meet patient needs across a broader
spectrum of temporary heart assist applications.  In September 2003 we received FDA
approval to market the AB5000 Ventricle, the first of these new blood
pumps.  AB5000 marketing efforts were
initially focused on introducing the system in the largest cardiothoracic
surgical centers through sales of consoles and sales of blood pumps.  Moving forward, we are focusing on upgrading
the BVS installed base to the AB5000 console, enabling more centers to benefit
from the flexibility and upgradeability of the computer-based AB5000 console.

The BVS and
AB5000 systems each consist of single-use external blood pumps and cannulae and
a reusable pneumatic drive and control console. 
Both are capable of assuming the full pumping function of a patient’s
failing heart, and are designed to provide either univentricular or
biventricular support.  Both are
currently approved by the FDA for temporary use while the patient’s heart is
allowed to rest, heal and recover.  The
AB5000 console is capable of controlling both the BVS and the AB5000 blood
pumps, and incorporates upgradeable software features to accommodate future
product line enhancements, while the BVS console supports only the BVS blood
pump.  It is our intent to seek expansion
of the current approved indications for use of the AB5000 in order to allow
support of expanded patient populations for longer periods of support.

On May 10, 2005, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding capital stock of Impella CardioSystems AG (“Impella”), a privately
held company located in Aachen, Germany. 
Accordingly, the operating results of Impella from May 10, 2005 will be
included in the Company’s results beginning with the


first quarter of fiscal 2006.  Impella
manufactures and sells small, minimally invasive, high performance micro blood
pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use in interventional cardiology
and heart surgery.  These pumps are
designed to provide left ventricle support for patients suffering from reduced
cardiac output and can potentially aid in recovering the hearts of patients
suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI or Heart Attack), including
those who have gone into cardiac shock. 
Impella has CE marks for each of its devices and currently markets them
throughout Europe.  We intend to seek FDA
approval to sell the Impella Recover System blood pumps in the United States in
order to address wider market opportunities for cardiac assist and
recovery.  ABIOMED acquired Impella in
exchange for approximately $1.6 million in cash and 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED
common stock, of which 210,000 shares are to be held in escrow for potential
claims for indemnification by the Company pursuant to the terms of the purchase
agreement. The 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED common stock have a fair value of
$42.2 million.  Accordingly, the purchase
price (before contingent payments) will be $45.3 million, inclusive of
approximately $1.5 million of acquisition costs.  In addition, the agreement provides that
ABIOMED may make additional contingent payments to Impella’s former
shareholders based on the Company’s future stock price performance and
additional milestone payments related to FDA approvals and unit sales of
Impella products.  These contingent
payments range from zero dollars to approximately $29 million and will be made
in a combination of cash or stock, if at all. 
The Company has not yet determined the preliminary purchase price
allocation due to the recent nature of the acquisition.  However, management believes that more than
half of the purchase price will be recorded to goodwill, and a write-off of
in-process research and development will be recorded in the first quarter of
fiscal 2006.  Also, significant
amortization of intangible assets will impact fiscal 2006 and future results.

Research and
development is a significant portion of our operations.  Our research and development efforts are
focused on the development of new products related to heart assist, heart
recovery and heart replacement, and the continued enhancement of current
technologies.  One such effort is the
AbioCor II, a smaller replacement heart incorporating a pumping mechanism
different from that of the AbioCor that is currently undergoing animal
testing.  Our operating results reflect
the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research
and development of new technologies.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The Company’s
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
are based on its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate
our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,
bad debts, warranty obligations, inventory valuations and income taxes. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe
the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements.

Revenue Recognition

.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB
104”) provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of
revenue in financial statements.  SAB 104
establishes the SEC’s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue
until all of the following criteria are met: 
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is
fixed or determinable, and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.   Further, SAB 104 requires that both title
and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before
revenue can be recognized.  We believe
that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SAB 104.


We derive our revenues from two principal sources:  (1) product sales, including maintenance
service agreements, and (2) funded research and development contracts and
grants from government and other third party sources.  The great majority of our product revenues
are derived from our shipment of BVS and AB5000 products to fulfill customer
orders for a specified number of consoles and/or blood pumps for a specified
price. We recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon
product shipment.

During the three years ending March 31, 2005 a
declining percentage of our BVS product revenue was derived from extended-term
contracts with certain of our customers. 
These contracts, the last of which ended in due course this past fiscal
year, provided customers with units of our BVS product under contract terms of
one to three years.  The Company received
a fixed, non-refundable amount of money for providing these customers with BVS
blood pumps during the term of the contract to replace those used to support
patients.  In addition to SAB 104, we
followed the guidance of EITF 00-21

, Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables

, in our calculation and recognition of
the relative sales value for each element of these extended-term
contracts.  In so doing, we recognized
revenue and recorded cost of product revenues ratably over the term of the
contract using an estimated per unit selling price based upon actual shipments
of pumps to customers compared to the maximum number of additional pumps
allowable under the contract.  When a
maximum number of pumps was not specified in the sales contract, we compared
actual shipments to our estimate of additional pumps that might be required by
the customer. In the majority of contracts that contained contractual limits on
the number of pumps, customers did not use the maximum number of allowable
pumps and, as a result, we recognized the remaining deferred revenue at the end
of the contract term with no associated incremental cost.

Cash received in advance of revenue in
connection with the sale of blood pumps under extended-term contracts is
recorded as deferred revenue and is classified as a current or long-term
liability depending on the expected shipment dates of the blood pumps.

Maintenance service revenues are recognized
ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of
the service contract.

Government-sponsored
research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on
a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. Revenues from these contracts and grants are
recognized as work is performed, provided the government has appropriated
sufficient funds for the work. Under contracts in which the Company elects to
spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract
than the total contract amount, the Company prospectively recognizes revenue on
such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as it incurs related
research and development costs, provided the government has appropriated
sufficient funds for the work.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

. We
continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a
provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any
specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit
losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions
established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same
credit loss rates that we have in the past. If the financial condition of our customers
were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, additional allowances would be required.

Warranties

. Our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality
standards. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers, our
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and product recalls.
Our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product
failures, including product recalls, exceeds our estimated warranty provision.

Inventories

.  We value our inventory of
products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value.

We regularly review inventory quantities on
hand and write down to its net realizable value any inventory believed to be
impaired.  If actual demand or market
conditions are less favorable than projected demand, additional inventory
write-downs may be required that could adversely


impact
financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete
inventory is identified.  The inventory
balances at March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005, are net of accumulated
impairment write-downs of $1,119,000 and $887,000, respectively.

All of our inventories are
related to our heart assist product line. We will not capitalize any costs
related to AbioCor inventory until we receive regulatory approval to begin
commercial sales.

Income Taxes

. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial
statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the
jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our
actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences
resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition,
as of March 31, 2005, the Company had federal and state tax net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $74.8 million and $34.6 million, respectively,
that begin to expire in 2006. The Company also has federal and state research
and development credit carryforwards of approximately $5.1 million and $3.3
million, respectively, that begin to expire in 2006. We have recorded a
valuation allowance of $52.2 million as an offset against these otherwise
recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the
timing of the realization of the tax benefit. In the event that we determine in
the future that the Company will be able to realize all or a portion of its net
deferred tax benefit, an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would
increase net income in the period such a determination was made.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth certain
consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a
percentage of total revenues (which includes revenues from products and funded
research and development):

Fiscal Years Ended
March 31, 2005 and March 31, 2004 (“fiscal 2005” and “fiscal 2004”)

Product Revenues.

Product revenues increased by $12.9 million, or 51%, from $25.1
million in fiscal 2004 to $37.9 million in fiscal 2005.  The improvement is attributable to increased
sales of both our AB5000 consoles and ventricles and our BVS 5000 disposable
blood pumps.  A majority of the increased
product sales were derived from our delivering a record number of AB5000
systems and reorder ventricles during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as a
result of the product continuing to gain market acceptance as patient outcomes
continued to improve with its wider use. 
Higher average unit selling prices for both products also contributed to
approximately half the increased revenue performance during the past fiscal
year.  Our European subsidiary, ABIOMED
B.V., set a company record for revenues during the fiscal year ending March 31,
2005 by increasing product revenues by 56%, or $0.7 million, over the prior
year.  International product revenue from
sources outside of Europe also increased by 10% during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2005 as a result of our efforts to establish and strengthen
international distribution channels.  Of
the $37.9 million in product revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005,
approximately 80% was derived from sales of


AB5000 Ventricles and BVS disposable blood
pumps.  As of March 31, 2005, we have a
sales backorder and deferred revenues of approximately $0.6 million, primarily
as a result of our multi-year customer service support contracts.

International
sales accounted for 8% of total product revenue during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2005 and 2004.

Going
forward, we expect our core legacy products to generate revenue growth of 26 –
36% during our fiscal year ending March 31, 2006, in addition to sales of
Impella product sales of approximately $4 million in Europe.  We also expect that the BVS will remain an
important part of our heart assist product portfolio, as we anticipate
continuing demand for BVS blood pumps.

Funded Research and
Development Revenues.

During recent years our efforts to obtain
government research and development contracts and grants have been limited, as
a result of directing our technical personnel and other resources towards
development and commercialization of existing technology.  As a result, externally funded research and
development revenue decreased by $0.4 million, or 59%, from $0.7 million during
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 to $0.3 million during the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2005.

As of March 31, 2005, our total backlog of
research and development contracts and grants was $0.3 million. All of these
contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the
convenience of the government.

Cost of Product
Revenues.

Our cost of product revenues as a percentage
of product revenue improved for the fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal
2004.  Cost of product revenues as a
percentage of product revenues was 25% for fiscal 2005 compared to 30% in
fiscal 2004.  Approximately 80% of the
improvement in margin is the result of higher average unit selling prices for
our AB5000 and BVS pumps in comparison to the prior fiscal year with the
remainder in improvement coming from increased productivity in our
manufacturing processes.

Research and
Development Expenses

.

Research and development expenses
decreased by $0.8 million, or 6%, from $14.3 million in fiscal 2004 to $13.5
million in fiscal 2005.  Research and
development expenses were 35% of total revenues for fiscal 2005 and 56% of
total revenues in fiscal 2004. The decrease is primarily as a result of
shifting our labor and other costs to commercial BVS and AB5000 manufacturing
activities offset by increased development efforts on potential new products.
We expect research and development expenses to increase year over year as we
invest in the development of new products in circulatory care to be introduced
in the market in the next 12 to 18 months.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $4.5
million, or 32%, from $14.1 million in the prior year to $18.6 million in
fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.  The
increases are primarily the result of labor, recruiting and relocation expenses
incurred in connection with our adding new senior management earlier this
fiscal year and expenses in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley 404
compliance.  In addition, sales and
marketing expenses increased significantly as a result of our efforts to expand
our commercial operations both domestically and internationally.

Other Income

.  Other income consists
primarily of interest earned on our investment balances, net of expenses and
foreign exchange gains or losses.  Other
income was $0.9 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of $0.1 million from $0.8
million in fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily due to interest income
representing better yields on investments offset by a reduction of the foreign
translation gain.

Net Loss.

Net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was
approximately $2.3 million, or $0.11 per share. This is a 75% reduction from
the net loss of approximately $9.4 million, or $0.45 per share, in the prior
fiscal year.


Fiscal Years Ended
March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2003 (“fiscal 2004” and “fiscal 2003”)

Product Revenues.

Product revenues increased by $2.0 million, or 8%, from $23.1
million in fiscal 2003 to $25.1 million in fiscal 2004. The increase is
attributable to sales of AB5000 consoles and ventricles during the controlled
clinical rollout that began in the first fiscal quarter for the console and in
the second fiscal quarter for the ventricle. 
Product revenue reflects fulfillment of all of the sales backlog
reported at the end of our third fiscal quarter.  Going forward, we expect total revenue growth
in excess of 10% annually driven by sales of AB5000 consoles and ventricles
subsequent to the full product rollout in April 2004.  Revenue growth may be concentrated in the
second half of fiscal 2005. We also expect that the BVS will remain an
important part of our heart assist product portfolio, as we anticipate
continuing demand for BVS blood pumps.

Domestic
sales accounted for 92% of total product revenue during fiscal 2004 and 94% of
product revenue for fiscal 2003.

Funded Research and
Development Revenues.

Contract revenues increased by $0.5 million
to $0.7 million in fiscal 2004 from $0.2 million in fiscal 2003.  As of March 31, 2004, our total backlog of
research and development contracts and grants was $0.3 million. All of these
contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the
convenience of the government.

Cost of Product
Revenues.

Cost of product revenues as a percentage of
product revenues improved to 30% for fiscal 2004 from 32% in fiscal 2003.  The improvement in margin is primarily the
result of lower manufacturing costs, increased sales as a result of the
introduction of the new AB5000 system, and a write-down of inventory of an
older model of the BVS console to its net realizable value in the prior
year.  We expect that the growth of
AB5000 product revenues will support continued margin improvement in future
reporting periods.

Research and
Development Expenses

.

Research and development expenses
decreased by $6.3 million, or 30%, from $20.6 million in fiscal 2003 to $14.3
million in fiscal 2004.  Research and
development expenses were 88% of total revenues for fiscal 2003 and 56% of
total revenues in fiscal 2004. The largest portion of this decrease is
attributable to research and development expenses incurred for the AbioCor,
which decreased by $5.3 million from $15.0 million for fiscal 2003 to $9.7 million
during fiscal 2004. These AbioCor reductions are primarily due to labor and
material purchases related to manufacture of AbioCor units as well as
development and testing activities.

Research
and development expense for fiscal 2004 also included costs

associated
with ongoing development of the AB5000, including costs associated with efforts
to obtain regulatory approval for our new AB5000 ventricle as well as those
associated with future heart assist blood pumps and cannulae that are expected
to operate with the new AB5000 platform. 
Also included in research and development expense during fiscal 2004 are
lesser costs associated with continued development and testing of the AbioCor
II.  We anticipate that the majority of
our near-term research and development focus will be on further extending the
AB5000 product line, completing the initial AbioCor clinical trial and securing
approval of a humanitarian device exemption for initial commercial introduction
of the AbioCor, and developing the AbioCor II.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 4%,
from $14.7 million in the prior year to $14.1 million in fiscal year ended
March 31, 2004.  This reduction is
attributable to lower accounting and legal costs as well as reductions in
selling and clinical support costs.  As
we plan to increase both sales and clinical support staffing in order to
support the ongoing rollout of the AB5000 product, selling and clinical support
costs are likely to increase going forward.

Throughout
fiscal 2004 we incurred certain expenses associated with business development
activities, primarily related to the review of business opportunities related
to rotary blood pump technologies.  These
activities may continue in the coming year and beyond, and may be expanded to
encompass a wider array of different business opportunities clustered around
our existing mechanical circulatory support business.  If these activities were to result in a major
new business initiative, it is possible that we would decide to seek new
financing in order to support that initiative.


In April
2004 David M. Lederman, Ph.D., ABIOMED’s founder, stepped down as President and
Chief Executive Officer and was succeeded in those positions by Michael R.
Minogue.  Dr. Lederman remains Chairman
of the Board and an employee of the Company. 
Subsequent to our fiscal year ending March 31, 2004, ABIOMED’s
management team has been strengthened by a number of new appointments to fill
existing vacancies and/or newly defined senior management functions.  We have incurred one-time costs associated
with recruitment and/or relocation of Mr. Minogue and these new senior
personnel, much of which will be recorded in the Company’s fiscal year ending
March 31, 2005.

Other Income

. Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our
investment balances, net of expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss.  Interest and other income was $0.8 million in
fiscal 2004, a decrease of $0.5 million from $1.3 million in fiscal 2003. This
decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from
lower average interest rates and lower average fund balances available for
investment.  As a result of our improving
financial performance and the continuing reduction in research and development
expenditures as the AbioCor approaches initial commercial introduction, we were
able during fiscal 2004 to move some of our cash and short term assets into
longer term instruments in order to improve future yields.  Foreign translation costs were nearly
constant year-to-year.

Net Loss

. Net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 was
approximately $9.4 million, or $0.45 per share. This is a 48% reduction from
the net loss of approximately $18.2 million, or $0.87 per share, in the prior
fiscal year. The losses for both years are primarily attributable to
development and clinical testing costs associated with the AbioCor, the AbioCor
II, the AB5000 circulatory assist system and costs of developing other
technologies and products.  Continued
reduction of our net loss is an important goal of management, and we anticipate
moving into profitability before the end of fiscal 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have supported
our operations with net revenues from sales of our BVS and AB5000 circulatory
assist product line, government contracts and proceeds from our equity
offerings.  As of March 31, 2005, our
cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities and long-term
investments totaled $43.6 million.

During the
year our financial performance from business operations, driven by higher
product revenues, resulted in a substantial reduction in our use of cash.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, cash used by operating activities
was $ 5.2 million, or 49%, less than the $10.0 million consumed by operations
in the comparable period of the prior year. 
There was also an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of $2.6
million and $1.2 million, respectively as a result of the Company's planned
higher level of product sales.  Net cash
consumption from all activities, as determined by the net change in cash,
short-term marketable securities and long-term investments, decreased to $1.9
million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, compared to $9.0 million
consumed in the prior fiscal year.  The
difference of $7.1 million represents an 79% decline in cash consumption.

During this
fiscal year the Company benefited from $4.1 million in cash proceeds from the
employee stock option exercises and employee participation in the company’s
stock purchase plan.

Income taxes incurred during the fiscal year 2005 were
not material, and we continue to have significant net tax operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards.

We believe that
our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be
sufficient to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months, including
funding operating capital of approximately $12.0 million to $15.0 million for
Impella operations and the planned expenditures for our AbioCor and AbioCor II
implantable replacement hearts, and continued development and commercialization
efforts of our BVS 5000 and AB5000 circulatory assist products.  We may, however, need additional funds for
possible strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies
complementary to our business and their subsequent integration and operating
capital. If additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to
time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings.


Contractual
Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The
following table (in thousands) summarizes our contractual obligations at March
31, 2005 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity
and cash flows in future periods.

The Company has no long-term debt or
material commitments at March 31, 2005. 
We have elected not to exercise a buyout option available under the
Company’s primary lease that would have allowed for early termination of the
lease in 2005.

On May 10,
2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Impella
CardioSystems AG (“Impella”), a privately held company located in Aachen,
Germany.  Accordingly, the operating
results of Impella from May 10, 2005 will be included in the Company’s
results beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006.  Impella manufactures and sells small,
minimally invasive, high performance micro blood pumps with integrated motors
and sensors for use in interventional cardiology and heart surgery.  ABIOMED acquired Impella in exchange for
approximately $1.6 million in cash and 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED common
stock, of which 210,000 shares are to be held in escrow for potential claims
for indemnification by the Company pursuant to the terms of the purchase
agreement. The 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED common stock have a fair value of $42.2
million.  Accordingly, the purchase price
(before contingent payments) will be $45.3 million, inclusive of approximately
$1.5 million of acquisition costs.  The
agreement provides that ABIOMED may make additional contingent payments to
Impella’s former shareholders based on the Company’s future stock price
performance and additional milestone payments related to FDA approvals and unit
sales of Impella products.  These
contingent payments range from zero dollars to approximately $29 million and
will be made in a combination of cash or stock, if at all.  The Company has not yet determined the
preliminary purchase price allocation due to the recent nature of the
acquisition.  However, management
believes that more than half of the purchase price will be recorded to
goodwill, and a write-off of in-process research and development will be
recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. 
Also, significant amortization of intangible assets will impact fiscal
2006 and future results.

In November 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34

.
This interpretation expands the disclosure requirements of guarantee
obligations and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair
value of the obligation assumed under a guarantee.  In general, FIN No. 45 applies to contracts
or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make
payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument
that is related to an asset, liability, or equity security of the guaranteed
party.  We apply the disclosure
provisions of FIN 45 to agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification
clauses.  These disclosure provisions
expand those required by SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
Contingencies

, by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types
of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance
is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which we are a
guarantor.

Product warranties – The Company
routinely accrues for estimated future warranty costs on its product sales at
the time of sale.  The AB5000 and BVS
products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards.  While the Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the
quality of component suppliers, its warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates.  Operating results could
be adversely effected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the
estimated warranty provision.

Patent
indemnifications – In many sales transactions, the Company indemnifies
customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by the Company’s
products.  The indemnifications contained
within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims. The Company
has never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent
infringement claims related to sales transactions.  Under the provisions of FIN No. 45,
intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only.

Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock involves
a high degree of risk. Current and prospective investors should carefully
consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all
of the other information in this Report. Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be severely harmed by any of the following risks.
The trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks and
uncertainties develop into actual events.

We do not operate at
a profit and cannot be assured of future profitability

.

We have had net losses in each of the past
three fiscal years. We are committed to making large expenditures for our new
products, including those acquired in connection with our recent acquisition of
Impella CardioSystems, AG, under development in fiscal 2006 and subsequent
fiscal years, which may result in losses in future periods. These expenditures
include costs associated with performing clinical trials, continuing our
research and development relating to our new products under development,
seeking regulatory


approvals and, if we receive these
approvals, commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing. The amount of
these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately, and cost overruns may
occur. We plan to fund a portion of these expenditures from our limited
existing financial resources and revenues from AB5000, BVS and Impella product
sales. We cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and
commercialize our new products, or that additional funds will be available on
commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In the event that we are unable to
obtain the necessary funding to develop and commercialize our products, our
business may be adversely affected.

Our operating results
may fluctuate unpredictably.

Our annual and quarterly operating results
have fluctuated historically and we expect these fluctuations to continue.
Among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are:

•

costs we incur developing and testing the AbioCor, AbioCor II and
other new products or product enhancements;

•

the timing of
regulatory actions, such as product approvals or recalls;

•

costs we incur
in anticipation of future sales, such as inventory purchases, expansion of
manufacturing facilities, or establishment of international sales offices;

•

the timing of
customer orders and deliveries;

•

competitive changes, such as price
changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make; and

•

economic conditions in the health
care industry and the state of cost containment efforts, including
reimbursement policies.

We believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our historical and future results will not necessarily be
meaningful, and that investors should not rely on them as an indication of
future performance. To the extent we experience the factors described above,
our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities
analysts or investors from time to time, which may cause the market price of
our common stock to decline.

The BVS and AB5000
circulatory assist products, our principal product and current primary source
of revenues, are vulnerable to competitive pressures, disruptions in sales,
continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements.

All of our product revenues to date have
come from sales of the BVS and AB5000 products. We believe that we will continue
to rely heavily on these products for at least the next several years until we
obtain regulatory approval for new products. In the event that a competitor
were to introduce new treatments, products and technologies which compete with
our products, add new features to their existing products or reduce their
prices to make their products more financially attractive to customers, our
revenue from our BVS and AB5000 products could decline. For example, in the
event of the expansion of technologies, which allow heart surgical procedures
to be performed without stopping the heart, a reduction in the market for the
BVS and AB5000 products could potentially result. Further, the BVS and AB5000
are subject to stringent and continuing FDA and other regulatory requirements,
including compliance with the QSR, adverse event reporting, prohibitions on
promoting the products for unapproved uses, and continued inspection and market
surveillance by the FDA. If our products are recalled or otherwise withdrawn
from the market, our revenues would likely decline, which would hurt our
business. In addition, variations in the quantity and timing of sales of our
new AB5000 consoles have a disproportionate effect on our revenues, because the
price of the console is substantially greater than the price of our disposable
blood pumps. If we cannot maintain and


increase our disposable blood pump
revenues from our BVS and AB5000 product line, our overall business and
financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our product
revenues increased in fiscal 2005 by 51% in comparison to fiscal 2004 and in
fiscal 2004 our product revenues increased by 8% in comparison to fiscal
2003.  To maintain or increase revenues
from sales of our current products, we may be required to adopt new sales and
marketing strategies, some of which may require expending additional capital
resources, or execute on existing strategies. The new strategies we may adopt
or execute on include:

•

regularly introducing enhancements and product line extensions;

•

product expansion within our markets through the acquisition of
existing companies whose products may require additional development or
clinical analysis for regulatory approval;

•

expanding sales of our BVS and AB5000 product line in
international markets, some of which require separate regulatory approvals; and

•

seeking new categories of patients to support with our technology
platform.

In the event that we are unsuccessful in
carrying out these new strategies, our revenues may decline.

We may not be
successful in expanding our sales activities into international markets.

We are seeking to expand our international
sales of the AB5000, BVS and Impella Recover circulatory assist systems by
recruiting direct sales and support teams for selected countries in
Europe.  To date we have limited
experience in selling our products internationally.  In fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, approximately
8% of our product revenues were derived from international sales.  Our international operations will be subject
to a number of risks, which may vary from the risks we experience in the U.S.,
including:

•

the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries
before our products may be sold or used;

•

longer sales cycles;

•

dependence on local distributors;

•

limited protection of intellectual property rights;

•

difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;

•

fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies; and

•

political and economic instability.

If we are unable to effectively expand our
sales activities in international markets, our results of operations could be
negatively impacted.

We depend on third
party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products. If
third party payers fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for
purchase and use of our products, our profitability would be adversely
affected.

Sales of medical products largely depend
on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government health care
programs and private health insurers. The cost of our AB5000 and BVS systems is


substantial, and we anticipate that the
cost of implanting the AbioCor in a patient will also be substantial. Without
the financial support of the government or third party insurers, the market for
our products will be limited. Medical products and devices incorporating new
technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to
determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement,
and if so, the level of reimbursement which may apply. We cannot be sure that
third party payors will reimburse sales of our products now under development,
or enable us to sell them at profitable prices. We also cannot be sure that
third party payors will continue the current level of reimbursement to
physicians and medical centers for use of the BVS and AB5000. Any reduction in
the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business.

The federal government and private
insurers have considered ways to change, and have changed, the manner in which
health care services are provided and paid for in the U.S. In the future, it is
possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on
Medicare and Medicaid spending. These controls and limits could affect the
payments we collect from sales of our products. Internationally, medical
reimbursement systems vary significantly, with some medical centers having
fixed budgets, regardless of levels of patient treatment, and other countries
requiring application for, and approval of, government or third party
reimbursement.  Even if we succeed in
bringing our new products to market, uncertainties regarding future health care
policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could
affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities
at profitable prices.

Prior to approving coverage for new
medical devices, most third party payors require evidence that the product has
received FDA approval, is not experimental, and is medically necessary for the
specific patient. Increasingly, third party payors require evidence that the
devices being used are cost-effective. The AbioCor and our other products under
development may not meet these or future criteria, which could hurt our ability
to market and sell these products.

If we fail to achieve
and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require or if
we are unable to develop additional manufacturing capacity, we will not be
successful.

Our products
require precise, high quality manufacturing. Our failure to achieve and
maintain these high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of
manufacturing errors, design defects or component failures, could result in
patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in
product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could
seriously hurt our business. We have from time to time voluntarily recalled
certain products. Despite our very high manufacturing standards, we cannot
completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or failures. If we are not
able to manufacture the AB5000, BVS and Impella Recover 2.5/5.0 micro blood
pump products in accordance with necessary quality standards, our business and
results of operations may be negatively affected.

The AbioCor involves even greater
manufacturing complexities than our current commercial products. The AbioCor
must be significantly more durable and meet different standards, which may be
more difficult to achieve, than those that apply to our current product line.
If we are unable to manufacture the AbioCor or other future products on a
timely basis at acceptable quality and cost and in commercial quantities, or if
we experience unanticipated technological problems or delays in production, our
business will suffer.

The manufacture of our products is and
will continue to be complex and costly, requiring a number of separate
processes and components. Achieving precision and quality control requires
skill and diligence by our personnel. Further, to be successful, we believe we
will need to increase our manufacturing capacity. We may experience
difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our new products, including
problems related to product yields, quality control and assurance, component
and service availability, adequacy of control policies and procedures, and lack
of skilled personnel. If we cannot hire, train and retain enough experienced
and capable scientific and technical workers, we may not be able to manufacture
sufficient quantities of our current or future products at an acceptable cost
and on time, which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise
damage our business.


If our suppliers
cannot provide the components we require, our ability to manufacture our
products could be harmed.

We rely on third party suppliers to
provide us with certain components used in the AB5000, BVS, Impella Recover
2.5/5.0 micro blood pumps, AbioCor, AbioCor II, and our other products under
development. Relying on third party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component
part failures and to interruptions in supply, either of which could impair our
ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a
timely basis. Using third party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes
impossible for us to test fully certain components, such as components on
circuit boards, maintain quality control, manage inventory and production
schedules and control production costs. Vendor lead times to supply us with
ordered components vary significantly and can exceed six months or more. Both
now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity, we cannot be sure that our
suppliers will furnish us with required components when we need them. These
factors could make it more difficult for us to effectively and efficiently
manufacture our products, and could adversely impact our results of operations.

Some
suppliers may be the only source for a particular component, which makes us
vulnerable to cost increases and supply interruptions. Vendors may decide to
limit or eliminate sales of certain products to the medical industry due to
product liability or other concerns, and we might not be able to find a
suitable replacement for those products. Manufacturers of our product
components may be required to comply with the FDA or other regulatory
manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection
with the manufacture of the components. If we cannot obtain a necessary
component, we may need to find, test and obtain regulatory approval for a
replacement component, produce the component ourselves or redesign the related
product, which would cause significant delay and could increase our
manufacturing costs. Any of these events could adversely impact our results of
operations.

We own
patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property
and know-how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. If we cannot
protect our intellectual property, competition could force us to lower our
prices, which could hurt our profitability.

Our intellectual property rights are and
will continue to be a critical component of our success. A substantial portion
of our intellectual property rights relating to the AB5000, BVS, Impella
Recover 2.5/5.0 micro blood pumps, AbioCor, AbioCor II and other products under
development is in the form of trade secrets, rather than patents. In order to
preserve certain proprietary information as trade secrets, we are required to
restrict disclosure of information intended to constitute trade secrets to
third parties. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part
through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other
parties. Certain of our consultants and third parties with whom we have
business relationships may also provide services to other parties in the
medical device industry, including companies, universities and research
organizations that are developing competing products. In addition, some of our
former employees may seek employment with, and become employed by, our
competitors. We cannot assure that confidentiality agreements with our
employees, consultants and third parties will not be breached, that we will
have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not
become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.  The loss of trade secret protection for
technologies or know-how relating to the AB5000, BVS, Impella Recover 2.5/5.0,
AbioCor or AbioCor II could adversely affect our business prospects.

Our business position will also depend in
part on our ability to defend our existing and future patents and rights and
conduct our business activities free of infringement claims by third parties.
We intend to seek additional patents, but our pending and future patent
applications may not be approved, may not give us a competitive advantage, and
could be challenged by others. Patent proceedings in the U.S. and in other
countries may be expensive and time consuming. In addition, patents issued by
foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under U.S.
patent law, and may not adequately protect our proprietary information. Our
competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes
that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours, or design around our
patents.


Companies in the medical device industry
typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual
property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the rights
of others. If a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement
against us, we may be liable for substantial damages, be unable to sell
products using that technology, or have to seek a license or redesign the
related product. These alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible. Patent
litigation could be costly, result in product development delays and divert the
efforts and attention of management from our business.

If we cannot attract
and retain the management, sales and other personnel we need, we will not be
successful.

We depend heavily on the contributions of
the principal members of our business, financial, technical, sales and support,
regulatory and clinical, operating and administrative management and staff,
many of whom would be difficult to replace. Competition for skilled and
experienced business management, scientific personnel and sales personnel in
the medical devices industry is intense. If we lose the services of any of the
principal members of our management and staff, or if we are unable to attract
and retain qualified personnel in the future, especially scientific and sales
personnel, our business could be adversely affected.

We expect to
grow rapidly if our products under development advance through the approval
process. The expansion of personnel and facilities will strain our management
and our financial and other resources. If we cannot manage this growth
successfully, our business will likely suffer.

Product liability
claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results.

The clinical use of medical products, even
after regulatory approval, poses an inherent risk of product liability claims.
We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage, subject to
deductibles and exclusions. We cannot be sure that product liability insurance
will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at
reasonable costs, or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage
against potential liabilities. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or
potential outcome, may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of
our products or expand our business.

Many patients supported by our products do
not survive. There are many factors beyond our control that could result in
patient death, including the condition of the patient prior to use of the
product, the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using
and monitoring the product, and product maintenance by customers. However, the
failure of the life support products we distribute for clinical test or sale
could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity.

The risk of product liability claims will
increase as we introduce new products that are intended to support a patient
until the end of life. For example, the AbioCor will have a finite life and
could cause unintended complications to other organs and may not be able to
successfully support all patients. Its malfunction could give rise to product
liability claims whether or not it has extended or improved the quality of the
patient’s life. We cannot be sure that we can obtain liability insurance to
cover the AB5000, BVS, Impella Recover 2.5/5.0, AbioCor or other new products
at a reasonable cost, if at all. If we have to pay product liability claims in
excess of our insurance coverage, our financial condition will be adversely
affected.

Failure
of our recent Impella acquisition to achieve its potential benefits could harm
our business and operating results.

We recently acquired all
of the outstanding capital stock of Impella CardioSystems AG. The acquisition
may not achieve its anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including:

•

problems in
successfully integrating our operations;

•

our inability
to obtain FDA approval and market acceptance for Impella’s products;


•

problems with
compatibility of business cultures;

•

problems in
successfully coordinating our research and development efforts;

•

difficulty in
integrating sales, support and product marketing;

•

costs and
delays in implementing common systems and procedures, including financial accounting
systems; and

•

the inability
to retain and integrate key management, research and development and customer
support personnel.

Further, we cannot assure
you that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits and synergies of the
acquisition. Any one or all of the factors identified above could cause
increased operating costs, lower than anticipated financial performance, or the
loss of customers, employees or business partners. The failure to integrate
Impella successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The
substantial costs of our Impella acquisition could harm our financial results.

In connection with our
acquisition of Impella, we incurred substantial costs. These include fees to
legal counsel, independent accountants and consultants.  We may also be required to make additional
contingent payments under the terms of the acquisition, in an amount of up to
$29,350,000, based on our future stock price performance and milestones related
to FDA approval and unit sales of Impella’s products.  If the benefits of the acquisition do not
exceed the associated costs, including any dilution to our stockholders
resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock in the transaction,
our financial results, including earnings per share, could suffer, and the
market price of our common stock could decline.

If we
acquire other companies or businesses, we will be subject to risks that could
hurt our business.

In addition to our recent
acquisition of Impella, in the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions to
obtain complementary businesses, products or technologies. Any such acquisition
may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we
anticipated, and an acquired business, product or technology might not perform
as we expected. If we pursue an additional acquisition, our management could
spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the
acquisition. If we complete an additional acquisition, we may encounter
significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the
operations and personnel of the acquired company into our operations while
preserving the goodwill of the acquired company. In particular, we may lose the
services of key employees of the acquired company and we may make changes in
management that impair the acquired company’s relationships with employees and
customers.

Any of these outcomes
could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of our additional
acquisitions. To pay for an acquisition, we might use stock or cash.
Alternatively, we might borrow money from a bank or other lender. If we use our
stock, our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests.
If we use cash or debt financing, our financial liquidity would be reduced. We
may be required to capitalize a significant amount of intangibles, including
goodwill, which may lead to significant amortization charges. In addition, we
may incur significant, one-time write offs and amortization charges. These
amortization charges and write offs could decrease our future earnings or
increase our future losses.


Our
rights distribution, certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could make
it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent our
stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock.

Our rights
distribution and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the
Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire us, even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a
premium over the prevailing market price of our stock. Our rights distribution
and those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law are
intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our
Board of Directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the
interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, such provisions may also
discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which
could negatively affect our stock price.

The market value of
our common stock could vary significantly, based on market perceptions of the
status of our development efforts.

The perception
of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could
significantly affect our stock price. As a result, the market price of our
common stock has and could in the future change substantially when we or our
competitors make product announcements. 
Many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond
our control.

Our future success is
strongly dependent on development of new assist products and implantable
replacement heart devices. Our development efforts may not be successful.

We are currently devoting our major
research and development and regulatory efforts, and significant financial
resources, to the development of the AbioCor and AbioCor II, product extensions
of existing commercial products and new products, such as the Impella Recover
2.5 and 5.0 micro blood pumps, for which we expect to obtain FDA approval and
to market in the next twelve to eighteen months. The development of assist and
replacement heart devices such as the AbioCor and AbioCor II, and other new
products, presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas, many or all of
which we may have difficulty in overcoming, including blood compatible
surfaces, blood compatible flow, manufacturing techniques, pumping mechanisms,
physiological control, energy transfer, anatomical fit and surgical techniques.
Specifically, for many years, we and other parties have been attempting to
develop a heart replacement device.  We
cannot be sure that we will be successful in our development efforts, and in
the event that we are unable to commercialize the AbioCor and AbioCor II, our
business and financial condition would be adversely affected.

The markets for our
products under development are unproven.

Even if our products are successfully
developed and approved by the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory
authorities, they may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success, which would
adversely affect our business and results of operations. Several factors could
limit our success, including:

•

our need to create a market for our new products: AB5000, AbioCor,
AbioCor II, Impella Recover 2.5 and Recover 5.0 micro blood pumps and possible
limited market acceptance among physicians, medical centers, patients and third
party payers;

•

the need for surgeons and cardiologists to develop or be trained
in new surgical techniques or non-invasive procedures in order to use our
products effectively;

•

limitations on the number of patients who may have access to
physicians and medical centers with adequate training, equipment and personnel
to make use of our products;

•

limitations inherent in first generation devices, and the
potential failure to develop successive improvements, including increases in
service life, which would reduce the addressable market for our products;

•

the lifestyle limitations that patients will have to accept;

•

the timing and amount of reimbursement for these products, if any,
by third party payers;


•

the introduction by other companies of new treatments, products
and technologies which compete with our products, and may reduce their market
acceptance, or make them obsolete;

•

the reluctance, due to ethical considerations, of physicians,
patients and society as a whole to accept significant medical devices that
replace or assist the heart; and

•

the reluctance of physicians, patients and society as a whole to
accept the finite life and risk of mechanical failure of devices that replace
or assist the heart.

The
commercial success of the AB5000, AbioCor, AbioCor II, Impella Recover 2.5 and
5.0 micro blood pumps and other heart assist products will require acceptance
by cardiovascular surgeons and interventional and heart failure cardiologists,
a limited number of whom significantly influence medical device selection and
purchasing decisions. We may achieve our business objectives only if our other
products are accepted and recommended by leading physicians, which is likely to
be based on a determination by these physicians that our products are safe,
cost-effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment. Although we have
developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons and cardiologists, we
cannot assure that these existing relationships and arrangements can be
maintained or that new relationships will be established in support of our
products. If cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists do not consider our
products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient
population or if a sufficient number of physicians recommend and use competing
products, it would seriously harm our business.

Testing of our new
products will involve uncertainties and risks which could delay or prevent new
product introductions, require us to incur substantial additional costs or
result in our failure to bring our products to market.

Development
and testing of design changes to the AbioCor, AbioCor II, Impella Recover 2.5
and 5.0 micro blood pumps and other products under development is often
extensive, expensive and time consuming. Some of the tests for our products may
require months or years to perform, and we could be required to begin these
tests again if we modify one of our products to correct a problem identified in
testing. Even modest changes to certain components of our products can take
months or years to complete and test. If results of pre-clinical or clinical
testing of our products under development indicate that design changes are
required, such changes could cause serious delays that would adversely affect
our results of operations. A number of companies in the medical industry have
suffered delays, cost overruns and project terminations despite achieving
promising results in pre-clinical testing or early clinical testing. In the
event that we suffer setbacks in the pre-clinical or clinical testing of our
heart assist and replacement products, these products may be delayed, require
further funding, and possibly may not be brought to market.

If we fail to obtain
approval from the FDA and from foreign regulatory authorities, we cannot market
and sell the AbioCor or other products in the U.S. and in other countries.

If we cannot demonstrate through clinical
testing on humans or other means that the AbioCor or other new products under
development and testing are safe and effective, we will not be able to obtain
regulatory approvals in the U.S. or other countries for the commercial sale of
these products. Our initial clinical testing of the AbioCor has been completed
and the results were submitted to the FDA to support our request for market
approval under an HDE in September 2004. The FDA has subsequently announced
that it will convene a special expert panel of cardiovascular surgeons and
cardiologists on June 23, 2005 to review and potentially approve the
groundbreaking technologies and clinical trial data behind the AbioCor.  We cannot assure that the FDA or any other
regulatory authority will act quickly or favorably on our requests for this
product approval, or that the FDA or any other regulatory authority will not
require us to provide additional data that we do not currently anticipate in
order to obtain product approvals.  If we
are successful in obtaining FDA approval for the AbioCor based on a phased
approach that begins with an HDE, the initial approval is likely to include conditions
or limitations to particular indications that would limit the available market
for these products. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use
of the AbioCor or our


other products under development, or if
the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad,
the commercial success of these products could be limited.

We intend to
market the AbioCor and our other new products in international markets, including
the European Union and Japan. We must obtain separate regulatory approvals in
order to market our products in other jurisdictions. The approval process may
differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the U.S. or in any other
jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign
approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us,
and require additional trials and additional expense.

If we obtain
regulatory approval of our new products, the products will be subject to
continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements, which could affect the
manufacturing and marketing of our products.

The FDA
continues to review products even after they have received initial approval. If
and when the FDA approves the AbioCor, or our other products under development,
the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing
regulation, including compliance with QSR, adverse event reporting requirements
and prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses.

We will also
be required to obtain additional approvals in the event we significantly modify
the design of an approved product or the product’s labeling or manufacturing
process. Modifications of this type are common with new products, and we
anticipate that the first generation of each of our products will undergo a
number of changes, refinements and improvements over time. For example, the
current configuration of the AbioCor’s thoracic unit, or “replacement heart,”
is sized for patients with relatively large chest cavities, and we anticipate
that we will need to obtain regulatory approval of thoracic units of other
sizes. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approval of modifications to our
current and future products, the commercial success of these products would be
limited.

We and our
third-party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and
market surveillance by the FDA for QSR and other requirements. Enforcement
actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could
result in fines, suspensions of approvals, recalls of products, operating
restrictions and criminal prosecutions, and affect the manufacture and
marketing of our products. The FDA could withdraw a previously approved product
from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information, including a
failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the occurrence of unanticipated
problems with products following approval, or other reasons, which could
adversely affect our operating results.

The cost of
developing and manufacturing the AbioCor, AbioCor II and other planned new
products acquired in connection with our acquisition of Impella CardioSystems,
AG, is substantial for a company of our size and might exert a strain on our
available resources.

While our total research and development
expenditures have decreased, spending on our AbioCor, AbioCor II and other
products under development or acquired in connection with our acquisition of
Impella CardioSystems, AG will remain significant for some time.  We expect that we will also need to make
significant expenditures to begin to manufacture and market the AbioCor and our
other planned new products in commercial quantities for sale in the U.S. and
other countries, if and when we obtain regulatory approval. We cannot be sure
that our estimates of capital expenditures for the development of our new
products will be accurate. We could have significant cost overruns, which could
reduce our ability to commercialize our products. Any delay or inability to
commercialize our products under development could adversely affect our
business prospects and results of operations.


ITEM 7A

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT
MARKET RISK

While we do not invest
for speculative purposes, we are exposed to market risk related to changes in
interest rates. Our guidelines allow for an investment portfolio consisting
mainly of U.S. Treasury notes, federal agency obligations, state and municipal
bonds, and corporate bonds with maturities of two years or less and ratings of
at least AA by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s. These held-to-maturity
securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market
interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately
and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at March 31, 2005, we believe the
decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be
immaterial.  We believe, however, that we
have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and
therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be
affected by a change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief
Executive Officer and our Acting Chief Financial Officer (the principal
accounting officer),

and
all members of the senior management team held a Disclosure Committee meeting
on May 18, 2005 and after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e)) have concluded that, based on such evaluation as of the end of the
period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to
the Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries, was made known to them by
others within those entities.

Evaluation of Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended
March 31, 2005, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that have affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, materially
our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations


of the Treadway Commission.  Based on our evaluation under the framework
in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

,
our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of March 31, 2005.  Our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which is included herein.

Important
Considerations

The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to
various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in
decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the
soundness of our systems, and the risk of fraud.  Moreover, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree
of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.  Because of these limitations, there can be no
assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal
control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or
fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the
appropriate levels of management.

ABIOMED, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS OF MARCH 31,
2004 AND 2005

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To Board of Directors and
Stockholders of ABIOMED, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit of ABIOMED, Inc.’s 2005
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2005 and audits of its 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based
on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders’ equity, and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ABIOMED, Inc. and its subsidiaries at March 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A,
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of March 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control
over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes

F-1

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUMMARY OF
OPERATIONS

ABIOMED, Inc.
and subsidiaries (the Company) is engaged primarily in the development,
manufacture and marketing of medical products designed to safely and
effectively assist, recover or replace the pumping function of the failing
heart. The Company is currently seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) for its
AbioCor battery-powered totally implantable artificial heart for patients who
would otherwise die from heart failure. 
The FDA has scheduled an expert panel of cardiovascular surgeons and
cardiologists to meet on June 23, 2005 to review and potentially approve
the Company’s HDE submission.  The
Company currently markets and sells circulatory assist devices for the
temporary support of patients with reversible heart failure.

(2)

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of
certain significant accounting policies described below.

(a)

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries.  All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

(b)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated or assumed.  The more significant estimates reflected in
these financial statements include unit pricing of our BVS blood pumps sold
under extended-term contracts, revenue recognition, collectibility of accounts
receivable, inventory valuation, accrued warranty and other judgmental accrued
expenses.

(c)

Risks and Uncertainties

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the cardiac assist, recovery
and replacement industry, including, but not limited to, development by its
competitors of new technological innovations, uncertainty of unproven markets,
the high cost of new product development, dependence on key personnel,
protection of proprietary technology and compliance with regulations of the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign regulatory authorities
and agencies.

F-7

(d)

Revenue Recognition from Product Sales and Accounts
Receivable

SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104 (“SAB 104”) provides guidance on the recognition,
presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements.  SAB 104 establishes the SEC’s view that it is
not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are
met:  (1) persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, (3) the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable,
and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured.   Further, SAB 104 requires that both title
and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before
revenue can be recognized.

We derive our revenues
primarily from the sale of our AB5000 and BVS 5000 circulatory assist products,
including maintenance service agreements. 
To a lesser extent, we also recordrevenue from funded research and development
contracts and grants from government and other third party sources.  The majority of our BVS and AB5000 product
revenues are derived from our shipment of products to fulfill customer orders
for a specified number of consoles and blood pumps for a specified price. We
recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product
shipment.

During the three years
ending March 31, 2005 a declining percentage of our BVS product revenue
was derived from extended-term contracts with certain of our customers.  These contracts, the last of which ended in
due course this past fiscal year, provided customers with units of our BVS
product under contracts terms of one to three years.  The Company received a fixed, non-refundable
amount of money for providing these customers with BVS blood pumps during the
term of the contract to replace those used to support patients.  In addition to SAB 104, we followed the
guidance of EITF 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables

, in our calculation and recognition of the
relative sales value for each element of these extended-term contracts.  In so doing, we recognized revenue and
recorded cost of product revenues ratably over the term of the contract using
an estimated per unit selling price based upon actual shipments of pumps to
customers compared to the maximum number of additional pumps allowable under
the contract.  When a maximum number of
pumps was not specified in the sales contract, we compared actual shipments to
our estimate of additional pumps that might be required by the customer. In the
majority of contracts that contained contractual limits on the number of pumps,
customers did not use the maximum number of allowable pumps and, as a result,
we recognized the remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term
with no associated incremental cost. Revenue recognized from extended-term
contracts approximated $4,100,000, $1,000,000 and $100,000 for the fiscal years
ending March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Maintenance service
revenues are less than 5% of total revenues and are recognized ratably over the
term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service
contract.

International sales
represented 6%, 8% and 8% of product revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31,
2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. No single customer accounted for greater
than 10% of product revenues or accounts receivable during fiscal 2003, 2004 or
2005.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and
maintains a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and
any specific customer collection issues that are identified.  While such credit losses have historically
been within expectations and the provisions established, no guarantee can be
made that the Company will experience the same credit loss rates that it has in
the past.  If the financial condition of
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments, additional allowances would be required

.

Funded Research and Development Revenues

A portion of the Company’s
research and development expenses has been supported by contracts and grants
with various government agencies and other third party sources. The
government-sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally
provide for payment on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. The Company recognizes
revenues under its government contracts and grants as work is performed,
provided that the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work.
Under contracts in which the Company elects to spend significantly more on the
development project during the term of the contract than the total contract
amount, the Company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably
over the term of the contract as it incurs related research and development
costs, provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work.
The Company retains rights to all technological discoveries and products
resulting from these efforts

Warranties

The
Company routinely accrues for estimated future warranty costs on its product
sales at the time of sale.  The AB5000
and BVS products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards.  While the Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the
quality of component suppliers, its warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates.  Operating results could
be adversely effected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the
estimated warranty provision.  Warranty
costs are included in costs of sales within the consolidated statements of
operations. The Company estimated its current obligation for warranties at
$231,000 as of March 31, 2005.

The
following table summarizes the activities in the warranty accrual for the two
years ended March 31, 2005 (in thousands),

F-9

(h)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower
of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and consist of the following (in
thousands):

All of the Company’s
inventories on the balance sheet relate to the AB5000 and BVS temporary cardiac
assist product line. Because the AbioCor replacement heart is not yet available
for commercial sale, inventories do not currently include any costs associated
with AbioCor manufactured systems or component parts.  Finished goods and work-in-process
inventories consist of direct material, labor and overhead.

The Company regularly
reviews inventory quantities on hand and writes down to its net realizable
value any inventory believed to be impaired. 
If actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected
demand, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could adversely
impact financial results for the period in which the additional excess or
obsolete inventory is identified.  The
inventory balances at March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005 are net of
accumulated impairment write-downs of $1,119,000 and $887,000, respectively.

(i)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is
recorded at cost.  Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the cost of significant
improvements is capitalized.  The Company
provides for depreciation and amortization on property and equipment by charges
to operations in amounts that allocate the cost of depreciable assets over
their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:

Depreciation and
amortization expense related to property and equipment was $1,513,000,
$1,230,000 and $1,093,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2004
and 2005, respectively.

F-10

(j)

Intellectual Property

The
Company capitalizes as intellectual property costs incurred, excluding costs
associated with Company personnel, relating to patenting its technology.  Capitalized costs, the majority of which
represent legal costs, reflect the cost of both awarded patents and patents
pending.  The Company amortizes the cost
of these patents over the estimated useful life of the patents up to seven
years.  If the Company elects to stop
pursuing a particular patent application or determines that a patent
application is not likely to be awarded for a particular patent or elects to
discontinue payment of required maintenance fees for a particular patent, the
Company at that time records as expense the net capitalized amount of such
patent application or patent.

(k)

Net Loss per Share

Basic
net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of
dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Dilutive shares
outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted shares outstanding any potential
(unissued) common stock from outstanding stock options and warrants based on
the treasury stock method. In fiscal years when net income is reported, the
calculation of diluted net income per share typically results in lower earnings
per share than is calculated using the basic method.  In fiscal years when a net loss is reported,
such as the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, these
potential shares from stock options and warrants are not included in the
calculation because they would have an anti-dilutive effect, meaning the loss
per share would be reduced.  Therefore,
in fiscal years when a loss is reported the calculation of basic and dilutive
loss per share results in the same value.

The
calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 excludes potential stock from
unexercised stock options that have a purchase price below the average market
price as shown below.

The
calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding excludes unissued
shares of Common Stock associated with outstanding stock options that have
exercise prices greater than the average market price.  For the fiscal years ending March 31,
2003, 2004 and 2005, the weighted average number of these potential shares
totaled 2,463,715, 1,908,347 and 825,014 shares, respectively.  The calculation of diluted weighted average
shares outstanding for these fiscal years also excludes warrants to purchase
400,000 share of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of
intellectual property (see Note 4).

F-11

On May 10,
2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Impella
CardioSystems AG (“Impella”), a privately held company located in Aachen,
Germany, in exchange for approximately $1,600,000 in cash and 4,029,004 shares
of ABIOMED common stock.  The agreement
also provides for a contingent payments in cash, ABIOMED stock, or a
combination of both, based on the Company’s future stock price performance and
additional milestone payments related to FDA approvals and unit sales of
Impella products.  The issuance of the
stock will have a material effect on future reported loss or earnings per share
(see Note 11).

(l)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company classifies
any marketable security with a maturity date of 90 days or less at the time of
purchase as a cash equivalent.

(m)

Restricted Cash

At March 31, 2004 and March 31, 2005, the
Company had restricted cash of approximately $58,000 and $97,000, respectively,
which is included in intellectual property and other assets, net.  This cash represents security deposits held
in the Company’s European bank for the primary office facility and certain auto
leases of ABIOMED B.V.

(n)

Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments

The Company classifies
any security with a maturity date of greater than 90 days at the time of
purchase as marketable securities and classifies marketable securities with a
maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date as long-term
investments.  Under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,

Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,

securities
that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
reported at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity securities.

The amortized cost,
including interest receivable, and market value of short-term marketable
securities were approximately $20,432,000 and $20,433,000 at March 31,
2004, and $33,887,000 and $33,773,000 at March 31, 2005, respectively.

The amortized costs,
including interest receivable, and market value of the long-term investments
were approximately $18,216,000 and $18,290,000 at March 31, 2004, and
$2,112,000 and $2,093,000 at March 31, 2005, respectively

At March 31, 2005
the investment portfolio consisted primarily of government securities and
corporate bonds with maturities of two years or less.

Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

As of March 31, 2004
and 2005, the Company’s financial instruments were comprised of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable,
the carrying amounts of which approximated fair market value because of their
short maturity.

(p)

Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130,

Reporting
Comprehensive Income

, requires disclosure of all components of
comprehensive income and loss on an annual and interim basis. Comprehensive
income and loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise
during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources.  Other than the
reported net loss, there were no components of comprehensive income or loss
which require disclosure for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and
2005.

(q)

Segment Information

SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, requires certain financial
and supplementary information to be disclosed on an annual and interim basis
for each reportable segment of an enterprise. The Company believes that it operates
in one business segment—the research, development and sale of medical devices
to assist, recover or replace the pumping function of the failing heart.

(r)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The
Company assesses the realizability of long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived
Assets and Disposal of Long-lived Assets

.  The Company reviews its long-lived assets for
impairment as events and circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable.  As a result of
its review, the Company does not believe that any impairment currently exists
related to its long-lived assets.

(s)

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for
stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed
by APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees

, and related interpretations, including
Interpretation 44,

Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation,

for its plans. The
Company has elected to follow the disclosure-only alternative requirements of
SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

(“SFAS 123”). 
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to
employees in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the
fair market value of Common Stock at the date of grant.

F-13

(s)

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (continued)

If compensation cost for
the Company’s fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005 grants issued under stock-based
compensation plans, including costs related to prior years grants had been
determined based on SFAS 123, the Company’s pro forma net loss and pro forma
loss per share for the years ended March 31, would have been as follows
(in thousands, except per share data):

The fair value per share
of the options granted during fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005 was computed as $1.69,
$1.53 and $3.94, per share, respectively

,

and was
calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions.

In addition to
compensation expense related to stock option grants, the pro forma compensation
expense shown in the table above includes compensation expense related to stock
issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan of approximately
$44,000, $19,000 and $28,000 for fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

This pro forma
compensation expense may not be representative of the amount to be expected in
future years as pro forma compensation expense may vary based upon the number
of options granted and shares purchased. 
The pro forma tax effect of the employee compensation expense has not
been considered due to the Company’s reported net losses.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs

(FAS 151), which adopts wording from the
International Accounting Standards Board’s (IASB) Standard No. 2,

Inventories

, in an effort to improve the comparability of
international financial reporting. The new standard indicates that abnormal
freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be
treated as current period charges rather than as a portion of inventory cost.
Additionally, the standard clarifies that fixed production overhead should be
allocated based on the normal capacity of a production facility. The statement
is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year
2007. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets

(FAS 153) which eliminates the exception from fair value
measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces
it with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The Company is
required to adopt FAS 153 for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2004 the
FASB issued a revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

(FAS 123(R)).  FAS 123(R) requires public entities to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and
recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to
provide service in exchange for the award. 
In April 2005, the SEC announced the adoption of a new rule that
amends the effective date for SFAS 123(R). The requirements of SFAS 123(R) are
effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.  Currently, the Company follows APB No. 25
which does not require the recognition of compensation expense relating to the
issuance of stock options so long as the quoted market price of the Company’s
stock at the date of grant is less than or equal to the amount an employee must
pay to acquire the stock.  The original
FAS 123 requires footnote disclosure only of pro forma net income as if a
fair-value-based method had been used. 
The adoption of FAS 123(R) is expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, although management is still
evaluating the impact.

INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS

Intellectual property and
other assets includes costs related to the Company’s awarded and pending
patents. The Company is amortizing the cost of these patents on a straight-line
basis over seven years, the estimated useful lives of the patents. The
unamortized cost of these patents approximated $569,000 and $418,000 as of March 31,
2004 and 2005, respectively. 
Amortization expense for patents totaled $191,000, $158,000 and $138,000
for the years ending March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.  Expense for abandonment of certain patents
totaled $235,000, $55,000 and $49,000 for the years ended March 31, 2003,
2004 and 2005.

CAPITAL
STOCK

Each share of
common stock has a voting right of one vote per share and generally has the
right to elect, as a class, at least 25% of the Company’s directors.

The Company has
authorized 1,000,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value,
of which the Board of Directors can set the designation, rights and
privileges.  No shares of Class B
Preferred Stock have been issued or are outstanding.

In August 1997,
the Company declared a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (the
Right) for each outstanding share of common stock to its stockholders of record
at August 28, 1997.  Each right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth
of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with a par
value of $0.01 per share, at a price of $45.00 per one one-thousandth of a
share, subject to amendment. In accordance with the terms set forth in the
Rights Agreement, the Rights are not exercisable until the occurrence of
certain events, as defined. In addition, the registered holders of the Rights
will have no rights as a common stockholder of the Company until the Rights are
exercised. The Company’s Board of Directors may amend the terms of the Rights.
The Rights expire on August 13, 2007.

In September 2000,
the Company issued common stock and warrants to acquire the exclusive rights to
the Penn State Heart together with complete ownership of a company incorporated
to commercialize the Penn State Heart called BeneCor Heart Systems, Inc.
The terms of this transaction consisted of payment of 110,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock, plus the issuance of warrants to purchase up to 400,000
additional shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01
per share.  Exercise of the warrants is
contingent on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones
with the Penn State Heart by specified dates, the last of which is September 30,
2007.  Warrants not vested and exercised
by September 30, 2007 expire. The value of the common stock and warrants
issued in connection with the transaction are included

F-16

in stockholders’
equity at values of $3,145,000 and $3,145,000, respectively, representing the
fair value of the stock and warrants based on the closing market price for the
Company’s stock on the closing date for this transaction.  These amounts were fully expensed as
in-process research and development on the date of acquisition because the
technology had no future alternate use. As of March 31, 2005, 400,000
warrants were outstanding and none were exercisable.

On May 10,
2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Impella
CardioSystems AG, a privately held company located in Aachen, Germany, in
exchange for approximately $1,600,000 in cash and 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED
common stock, of which 210,000 shares are to be held in escrow for potential
claims for indemnification by the Company pursuant to the terms of the purchase
agreement. The agreement also provides for contingent payments in cash, ABIOMED
stock, or a combination of both, based on the Company’s future stock price
performance and additional milestone payments related to FDA approvals and unit
sales of Impella products (see Note 11).

INCOME
TAXES

The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”)

.

The asset and
liability approach used under SFAS 109 requires recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of other assets and
liabilities.

Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the
financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
basis.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates.  A valuation reserve is established if it is
more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not
be realized.  Accordingly, a valuation
reserve has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset.

At March 31,
2005, the Company had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately  $74,800,000 and $34,600,000, which begin to
expire in 2006.  Additionally, at March 31,
2005, the Company had federal and state research and experimentation credit
carryforwards of approximately $5,100,000 and $3,300,000, respectively, which
begin to expire in 2006.  Based upon the
Internal Revenue Code, certain changes in company ownership may subject these
carryforwards to an annual limitation.

F-17

The
components of the Company’s net deferred taxes were as follows at March 31
(in thousands):

The
effective tax rate of zero differs from the statutory rate of 34% primarily due
to the inability of the Company to recognize deferred tax assets as a result of
its net operating loss position and the requirement that the Company pay income
taxes in states where net operating losses may not be utilized.  Of the total valuation allowance,
approximately $5,100,000 relates to stock option compensation deductions.  The tax benefit associated with the stock
option compensation deductions will be credited to equity when realized.

In
October 2004, the President signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act
(the “Act”).  The Act allows for a
federal income tax deduction for a percentage of income earned from certain
domestic production activities.  The
Company’s domestic, or U.S., production activities, will qualify for the deduction.  Based on the effective date of the Act, the
Company will be eligible for this deduction in the first quarter of fiscal
2006.  Additionally, on December 21,
2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 109-1,

Application
of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109),
to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

(FSP 109-1).  FSP 109-1, which was effective upon issuance,
states the deduction under this provision of the Act should be accounted for as
a special deduction in accordance with SFAS 109.  The Company has not yet quantified the
benefit, if any, that will be realized from this provision of the Act.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

The
Company applies the disclosure provisions of FIN No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, and Interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34

(FIN No. 45) to its agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification
clauses.  These disclosure provisions
expand those required by SFAS No. 5

Accounting for
Contingencies

, by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types
of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance
is remote.  The following is a
description of arrangements in which the Company is a guarantor.

Product
Warranties – The Company routinely accrues for estimated future warranty costs
on its product sales at the time of sale. 
The AB5000 and BVS products are subject to rigorous regulation and
quality standards.  While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including monitoring
and evaluating the quality of component suppliers, its warranty obligation is
affected by product failure rates. 
Operating results could be adversely effected if the actual cost of
product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision.

Patent
indemnifications – In many sales transactions, the Company indemnifies
customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by the Company’s
products.  The indemnifications contained
within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims. The Company
has never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent
infringement claims related to sales transactions.  Under the provisions of FIN No. 45,
intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only.

As
of March 31, 2005, the Company had entered into leases for its facilities,
including its primary operating facility in Danvers, Massachusetts, with terms
through fiscal 2010.  The Danvers lease
may be extended, at the Company’s option, for two successive additional periods
of five years each with monthly rent charges to be determined based on then
current fair rental values.  Total rent
expense under these leases, included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations, was approximately $823,000, $821,000 and $824,000 for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.

During the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2000, the Company entered into 36-month operating
leases totaling approximately $644,000 for the lease of office furniture.  These leases ended in fiscal year 2003 and at
the Company’s option the furniture was purchased.  Rental expense recorded for these leases
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 was approximately $127,000.

During
fiscal 2000, the Company entered into a 36-month capital lease for computer
equipment and software for approximately $221,000.  This lease ended in fiscal year 2003 and at
the Company’s option these assets were purchased.

Future minimum
lease payments under all non-cancelable operating leases as of March 31,
2005 are approximately as follows (in thousands):

F-19

From time-to-time,
the Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of
various types. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty,
management, in consultation with the Company’s general counsel, presently
believes that the outcome of each such other proceedings or claims which are
pending or known to be threatened, or all of them combined, will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

STOCK
OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS

With the exception of
10,140 outstanding options that were granted to certain employees during our
fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, with an exercise price of $0.01 per
share, all outstanding stock options of the Company as of March 31, 2005
were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date
of grant.  On March 1, 2005 we issued a
restricted stock grant of 24,000 shares to an officer of the Company. For the
stock awards granted below fair market value and the restricted stock grant,
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period in
accordance with SFAS 123.  Outstanding
stock options, if not exercised, expire 10 years from the date of grant.

The 1992
Combination Stock Option Plan (the “Combination Plan”), as amended, was adopted
in September 1992 as a combination and restatement of the Company’s then
outstanding Incentive Stock Option Plan and Nonqualified Plan. A total of
2,670,859 options were awarded from the Combination Plan during its ten-year
term that ended on May 1, 2002.  As
of March 31, 2005, 345,346 of these options remain outstanding, fully
vested and eligible for future exercise.

The 1998 Equity
Incentive Plan, (the “Equity Incentive Plan”), was adopted by the Company in August 1998.  The Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants
of options to key employees, directors, advisors and consultants as either
incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options as determined by the
Company’s Board of Directors.  A maximum
of 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be awarded under this plan.  Options granted under the Equity Incentive
Plan are exercisable at such times and subject to such terms as the Board of
Directors may specify at the time of each stock option grant.  Options outstanding under the Equity
Incentive Plan have vesting periods of 3 to 5 years from the date of grant.

F-20

The
2000 Stock Incentive Plan, (the “2000 Plan”), as amended, was adopted by the
Company in August 2000.  The 2000
Plan provides for grants of options to key employees, directors, advisors and
consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries as either incentive or
nonqualified stock options as determined by the Company’s Board of
Directors.  Up to 2,900,000 shares of
common stock may be awarded under the 2000 Plan and are exercisable at such
times and subject to such terms as the Board of Directors may specify at the
time of each stock option grant. Options outstanding under the 2000 Plan
generally vest 4 years from the date of grant.

The
Company has a nonqualified stock option plan for non-employee directors (the “Directors’
Plan”). The Directors’ Plan, as amended, was adopted in July 1989 and
provides for grants of options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock
to non-employee Directors of the Company. Up to 400,000 shares of common stock
may be awarded under the Directors’ Plan. Options outstanding under the
Director’s Plan have vesting periods of 1 to 5 years from the date of grant.

The following
table summarizes stock option activity under all of the Company’s stock option
plans:

F-21

The following table
summarizes certain data for options outstanding and exercisable under all plans
at March 31, 2005.

The Company has an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan), as amended.  Under the Purchase Plan, eligible employees
(including officers and directors) who have completed three months of
employment with the Company or its subsidiaries who elect to participate in the
Purchase Plan instruct the Company to withhold a specified amount from each
payroll period during a six-month payment period (the periods April 1 - September 30
and October 1 - March 31).  On
the last business day of each payment period, the amount withheld is used to

RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT

Research
and development is a significant portion of the Company’s operations. The
Company’s research and development efforts are focused on the development of
new products related to cardiac assist, recovery and heart replacement,
including the continued enhancement of the AB5000 and BVS products and related
technologies.  Research and development
costs are expensed when incurred and include direct materials and labor,
depreciation, contracted services and other costs associated with developing
new products and significant enhancements to existing products, including
amortized costs of purchased technology. Costs associated with
government-funded contracts and grants are recorded in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations as part of research and development
expenses as shown in the table below.

The
Company, at its sole discretion, may elect to further develop government-funded
technologies or products by spending resources outside or above the contract
limits. In fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005, the majority of the Company’s research
and development expenditures were directed towards the development of the
AbioCor Implantable Replacement Heart, the first generation of which has been
submitted to the FDA for approval under a Humanitarian Device Exemption.  Future costs for such development cannot be
definitively estimated at this time and are likely to be highly variable based
upon a number of factors, including clinical results and regulatory
requirements.

Research
and development costs consist of the following amounts (in thousands):

SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS – ACQUISITION OF IMPELLA CARDIOSYSTEMS AG

On May 10,
2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Impella
CardioSystems AG (“Impella”), a privately held company located in Aachen,
Germany.  Accordingly, the operating
results of Impella from May 10, 2005 will be included in the Company’s
results beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006.  Impella manufactures and sells small,
minimally invasive, high performance micro blood pumps with integrated motors
and sensors for use in interventional cardiology and heart surgery.  ABIOMED acquired Impella in exchange for
approximately $1.6 million in cash and 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED common
stock, of which 210,000 shares are to be held in escrow for potential claims
for indemnification by the Company pursuant to the terms of the purchase
agreement. The 4,029,004 shares of ABIOMED common stock have a fair value of $42.2
million.  Accordingly, the purchase price
(before contingent payments) will be $45.3 million, inclusive of approximately
$1.5 million of acquisition costs.  The
agreement provides that ABIOMED may make additional contingent payments to
Impella’s former shareholders based on the Company’s future stock price
performance and additional milestone payments related to FDA approvals and unit
sales of Impella products.  These
contingent payments range from zero dollars to approximately $29 million and
will be made in a combination of cash or stock, if at all.  The Company has not yet determined the
preliminary purchase price allocation due to the recent nature of the
acquisition.  However, management
believes that more than half of the purchase price will be recorded to
goodwill, and a write-off of in-process research and development will be
recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. 
Also, significant amortization of intangible assets will impact fiscal
2006 and future results.
