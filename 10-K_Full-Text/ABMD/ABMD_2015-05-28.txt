PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

We are a leading provider of temporary percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices and we offer a continuum of
care to heart failure patients. We develop, manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily performing the
pumping function of the heart. Our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab (cath lab) by interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons. A physician may use our
devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support before, during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures. We believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for patients experiencing heart failure because it enables
patients to go home with their own native heart and restores their quality of life. In addition, we believe that for the care of such patients, heart recovery is the most cost-effective solution for the healthcare system.

Our strategic focus and the driver of the majority of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our Impella family of products. Our
Impella 2.5 product received 510(k) clearance in June 2008 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. In March 2015, we received Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, from the FDA for Impella 2.5
during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, procedures. Impella 2.5 is the first hemodynamic support device to receive a PMA indication for use during high-risk PCI procedures, demonstrating its safety and
effectiveness for this complex patient population. With this approval, the Impella 2.5 is a temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients
with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 in these patients may
prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce peri- and post-procedural adverse events. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision to leave Impella 2.5 in place beyond the
intended duration of

£

6 hours due to unforeseen circumstances. Per our PMA approval, we will conduct a single-arm, post approval study on the Impella 2.5, collecting data on high-risk PCI patients. The
study will be a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from 70 sites supported with the Impella 2.5 system. The Impella 2.5 heart pump is supported by clinical guidelines, has been eligible to be reimbursed in the U.S. by the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS under ICD-9-CM code 37.68 since 2008 for multiple indications, including high-risk PCI.

We received 510(k) clearance in April 2009 for our Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices for circulatory support for up to six hours. These devices are larger and provide more blood flow to patients than the
Impella 2.5. In September 2012, our Impella CP product received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. We expect to submit Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD in fiscal 2016 as PMA supplements and that
these devices will retain their 510(k) clearances until FDA completes its review of the PMA supplements. We received FDA approval for Impella RP under a Humanitarian Device Exemption, or HDE, in January 2015. The Impella RP is the first percutaneous
single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval. Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP products also have CE Mark approval and Health Canada approval which allows us to market these
devices in the European Union and Canada.

The Impella product portfolio, which includes the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella
RP, Impella LD and Impella 5.0, has supported over 25,000 patients in the U.S.

Our revenues are primarily generated from this
product portfolio. Revenues from our non-Impella products, largely focused on the heart surgery suite, have been lower over the past several years as we have strategically shifted our sales and marketing efforts towards our Impella products and the
cath lab. We expect that most of our product and service revenues in the near future will be from our Impella products.

Our Products

Impella 2.5

The Impella 2.5 catheter is a percutaneous micro heart
pump with an integrated motor and sensors. The device is designed primarily for use by interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab who may require assistance to maintain their circulation. The Impella 2.5 catheter can be quickly
inserted via the femoral artery to reach the left ventricle of the heart where it is directly deployed to draw blood out of the ventricle and deliver it to the circulatory system. This function is intended to reduce ventricular work and provide flow
to vital organs. The Impella 2.5 is introduced with normal interventional cardiology procedures and can pump up to 2.5 liters of blood per minute.

The Impella 2.5 product received 510(k) clearance in June 2008 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. In March 2015, we received
Pre-Market Approval, or PMA, from the FDA for Impella 2.5 during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures. Impella 2.5 is the first hemodynamic support device to receive a PMA indication for use during high-risk PCI procedures, demonstrating its
safety and effectiveness for this complex patient population. With this approval, the Impella 2.5 is a temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically
stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 in these
patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce peri- and post-procedural adverse events. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision to leave Impella 2.5 in place
beyond the intended duration of

£

6 hours due to unforeseen circumstances. Per our PMA approval, we will conduct a single-arm, post-approval study on the Impella 2.5, collecting data on high-risk PCI
patients. The study will be a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from 70 sites supported with the Impella 2.5 system. The Impella 2.5 device has CE mark approval in Europe for up to five days of use and is approved for use in
over 40 countries.

A November 2011 update to the American College of Cardiology Foundation, or ACCF, / American Heart
Association, or AHA, Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions

Guidelines for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

, for the first time, included Impella in both the emergent and
prophylactic hemodynamic support settings. In addition, a December 2012 update to the AHA’s

Recommendations for the Use of Mechanical Circulatory Support: Device Strategies and Patient Selection

recommended Impella for use in mechanical
circulatory support; a December 2012 update to the ACCF/AHA

Guidelines for the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction

(STEMI) included Impella 2.5 for use in patients requiring urgent coronary artery bypass grafting with STEMI and
in treatment of patients with cardiogenic shock complications after STEMI; and a January 2013 update to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation

Guidelines for Mechanical Circulatory Support

included Impella for the first
time for patients with multi-organ failure. In addition, Impella was included in a January 2013 update to the ACCF /AHA Task Force on Practice

Guidelines for the Management of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction

and a September 2014 AHA /the
American College of Cardiology (ACC) Task Force on Practice

Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes

.

In addition to the U.S. clinical trial data, the Impella 2.5 PMA submission included clinical and scientific supporting evidence from more than 215 publications, covering 1,638 Impella 2.5 patients and
incorporated a medical device reporting (MDR) analysis from 13,981 Impella 2.5 patients. In addition to PROTECT I and PROTECT II, further data was provided in the submission from 637 high-risk patients enrolled in the U.S. Impella registry. The
U.S. Impella registry is an ongoing multicenter, observational retrospective registry that includes 49 centers. The data collection from the registry includes Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval, complete data monitoring and Clinical Events
Committee adjudication. Additionally, the PMA analysis included hemodynamic science described in the literature and validated with a series of pre-clinical and clinical studies.

Impella CP

In September 2012, we announced that the Impella CP received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The Impella CP provides blood flow of approximately one liter more per minute than the Impella 2.5 and is
primarily used by either interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab or by surgeons in the heart surgery suite. The Impella CP is indicated for up to six hours of partial circulatory support using an extracorporeal bypass
control unit. It is also intended to be used to provide partial circulatory support, for up to six hours, during procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. The Impella CP received CE Mark approval to be marketed in the European Union in April
2012 and Health Canada approval to be marketed in Canada in June 2012.

We are currently working with the FDA on a PMA
supplement for the Impella CP and we expect to file the application in fiscal 2016. We expect Impella CP to retain its 510(k) clearance until FDA completes its review of the PMA supplement.

Impella 5.0 and Impella LD

The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD are percutaneous micro heart pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use primarily in the heart surgery suite. These devices are designed to support patients who
require higher levels of circulatory support as compared to the Impella 2.5. The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices received 510(k) clearance in April 2009, for circulatory support for up to six hours and have CE Mark approval in Europe for up to
ten days’ duration and are approved for use in over 40 countries.



The Impella 5.0 can be inserted into the left ventricle via femoral cut down or through the
axillary artery. The Impella 5.0 pump goes through the ascending aorta, across the valve and into the left ventricle. The Impella LD is similar to the Impella 5.0 but is implanted directly through an aortic graft. The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD can
pump up to five liters of blood per minute, providing full circulatory support.

We are currently working with the FDA on a
PMA supplement for the Impella 5.0 and LD devices and we expect to file the application for these products in fiscal 2016. The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD will retain their 510(k) clearances until completion of the FDA process.

Impella RP

The Impella RP is a percutaneous catheter-based axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of flow per minute and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate
for right side heart failure.

In November 2012, we announced that the Impella RP received U.S. investigational device
exemption, or IDE, approval from the FDA for use in RECOVER RIGHT, a pivotal clinical study in the U.S. In March 2014, we completed enrollment of 30 patients at sites that present with signs of right side heart failure, require hemodynamic support,
and are being treated in the catheterization lab or cardiac surgery suite. The study collected safety and effectiveness data on the percutaneous use of the Impella RP and was submitted to the FDA in connection with the HDE application towards the
submission of an HDE. In January 2015, we received FDA approval for Impella RP under an HDE.

Impella RP is the first
percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval. An HDE is similar to a PMA application but is intended for patient populations of 4,000 or less per year in the U.S. and is subject to certain profit and
use restrictions. The Impella RP is a percutaneous device approved to provide support of the right heart during times of acute failure for certain patients who have received a left ventricle assist device or have suffered heart failure due to acute
myocardial infarction, or AMI, or a failed heart transplant. An HDE requires demonstration of the safety and probable benefit of the product, which is a lower standard than is applied to a PMA. In order to receive an HDE, there must be no comparable
devices approved under PMA that are available to treat the targeted population. An approved HDE authorizes sales of the device to any hospital after Institutional Review Board review and approval by the hospital. In April 2014, the Impella RP
received CE Marking approval which allows for commercial sales of Impella RP in the EU and other countries that require a CE Marking approval for sales.

AB5000

We manufacture and sell the AB5000 Circulatory Support
System for the temporary support of acute heart failure patients in profound shock, including patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack, post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock, or myocarditis. We believe the AB5000 is the only
commercially available cardiac assist device that is approved by the FDA for all indications where heart recovery is the desired outcome, including patients who have undergone successful cardiac surgery and subsequently develop low cardiac output,
or patients who suffer from acute cardiac disorders leading to hemodynamic instability. We expect revenues from the AB5000 to be a smaller part of our business in the future as we focus our efforts on the Impella suite of products.

Symphony

In November 2011, we announced Symphony, a synchronized minimally invasive implantable cardiac assist device designed to treat chronic patients with moderate heart failure by improving patient
hemodynamics and potentially improving their quality of life. The device is designed with the primary goal of stabilizing the progression of heart failure and recovering or remodeling the heart. To date, we have implanted the device in four patients
in first-in-human clinical trials of Symphony outside the U.S. We are evaluating the results of these cases and what impact on the Symphony product program moving forward. If we do continue to proceed, we would expect to conduct additional Symphony
trials outside of the U.S. in the future. Symphony is not currently approved by the FDA for sale in the U.S.

ECP

In July 2014, we acquired all of the issued shares of ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, or ECP, a German limited liability company, for
$13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payments up to a maximum of $15.0 million based on the achievement of certain technical, regulatory and commercial milestones. ECP, based in Berlin, Germany, is engaged in research, development,
prototyping and the pre-serial production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft. In connection with our acquisition of ECP, ECP acquired all of the issued shares of
AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions, or AIS, a German limited liability company, for $2.8 million in cash which was provided by us. AIS, based in Aachen, Germany, holds certain intellectual property useful to ECP’s business, and, prior to
being acquired by ECP, had licensed such intellectual property to ECP.

Summary of Recent Financial Performance

During fiscal 2015, we recognized net income of $113.7 million, or $2.80 per basic share and $2.65 per diluted share, compared to $7.4
million, or $0.19 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 was primarily



due to the net income tax benefit of $84.9 million primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We also had higher
Impella product revenue due to greater utilization of our Impella products in the U.S. and Europe in fiscal 2015.

Our Markets

According to the AHA, Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2014 Update Report, coronary heart disease, or CHD, causes
approximately one of every seven deaths in the United States. Coronary heart disease is a condition of the coronary arteries that causes reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected portion of the heart. Coronary heart disease
leads to AMI, commonly known as a heart attack, which may lead to heart failure, a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body’s major organs. In 2011, CHD mortality was 375,295. Each year, an estimated 635,000
Americans have a new coronary attack (defined as first hospitalized myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death) and approximately 300,000 have a recurrent attack. It is estimated that an additional 155,000 “silent” first
myocardial infarctions occur each year.

A broad spectrum of therapies exists for the treatment of patients in early stages of
CHD. Angioplasty procedures and stents are commonly used in the cath lab to restore and increase blood flow to the heart. These treatments are often successful in slowing the progression of heart disease, extending life, and/or improving the quality
of life for some period of time. Patients presenting with acute cardiac injuries potentially have recoverable hearts. Treatment for these patients in pre-shock in the cath lab is primarily focused on hemodynamic stabilization. Acute heart failure
patients in profound shock typically require treatment in the surgery suite. These are patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack, post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock or myocarditis complicated with cardiogenic shock. Chronic heart
failure patients have hearts that are unlikely to be recoverable due to left and/or right-side heart failure and their conditions cause their hearts to fail over time. Limited therapies exist today for patients with severe, end-stage, or chronic
heart failure.

In more severe cases of heart failure, patients are sent directly to the surgery suite for coronary bypass or
valve replacement surgery. The most severe acute heart failure patients are in profound cardiogenic shock, including those suffering from myocarditis (a viral attack of the heart), or from those suffering from an impaired ability of the heart to
pump blood after a heart attack or heart surgery. According to results of the SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial published in the August 26, 1999 edition of

The New England Journal of
Medicine

, approximately 7 to 10% of the patients who are hospitalized for a heart attack suffer from cardiogenic shock and 60 to 80% of those patients die. These patients typically require treatments involving the use of mechanical circulatory
support devices that provide increased blood flow and reduce the stress on the heart. Many less severe patients in the cath lab could also benefit from circulatory support devices or other clinical treatment, which could potentially prevent them
from entering into profound shock.

There are a few primary types of devices used in the cath lab and surgery suite in the
U.S. for circulatory support for pre-shock and profound shock patients: IABs, percutaneous assist devices, and surgical ventricular assist devices, or VADs.

An IAB is an inflatable balloon inserted via a catheter into a patient’s circulatory system and is inflated and deflated in the aorta. This is used as an initial line of therapy in the cath lab or
the surgery suite for patients with diminished heart function. There are an estimated 170,000 annual IAB procedures globally, with an estimated 75,000 IAB procedures annually in the U.S. However, IABs typically provide only limited enhancement and
depend on the patient’s own heart to generate the majority of the patient’s blood flow. In addition, IABs are often required to be used in conjunction with inotropes or other drugs to stimulate heart muscle ejection. The use of these
drugs, however, increases the risk of mortality. Clinical publications have demonstrated that the need for two or more inotropes to improve blood flow results in mortality rates of approximately 80%. Further, the clinical efficacy of IABs has
recently come into question due to the conclusions of the randomized, prospective, open-label, multicenter “SHOCK II” Trial. The conclusion of the trial was that the use of IAB counterpulsation did not significantly reduce 30-day mortality
in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction for whom an early revascularization strategy was planned. Further, IABs have limited effectiveness in patients that are arrhythmic and/or in cardiogenic shock and published
reports have indicated that IABs do not reduce mortality for patients in cardiogenic shock.

Percutaneous assist devices and
VADs are mechanical devices that help the failing heart pump blood or take over the pumping function of the failing heart. Historically, VADs have been highly invasive and require implantation in the surgery suite. Percutaneous assist devices allow
for less invasive placement and removal, and can be done through a small puncture in the leg in the catheterization lab, electrophysiology lab, or operating room. The use of surgically placed VADs generally falls into three sub-categories: recovery,
bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy.

Recovery VADs are designed to enable the patient’s heart to rest and
potentially recover so that the patient can return home with his or her own heart. Because recovery is the goal, these devices are designed to minimize damage to heart tissue and are removed once the patient’s heart has recovered. If possible,
recovery of a patient’s heart is generally preferred to transplantation or prolonged device implantation, both of which have significant side effects for the patient and increase the risk of mortality. We believe heart recovery is a preferred
clinical outcome for patients, since it also generally lowers the overall relative cost to the healthcare system versus alternative therapies and treatment paths that may require multiple surgeries, lengthy or repeated hospital stays, chronic
therapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs and other related healthcare costs.



Research and Product Development

Since our founding in 1981, we have gained substantial expertise in circulatory support through the development of many product platforms
to support heart patients. This includes our Impella platform and AB5000 systems that we currently market and other technologies that we previously supported, such as our BVS system and AbioCor program. We also continue to work on developing new
technologies as well, such as ECP and Symphony development programs. Our current strategy is to develop a complete portfolio of products for partial and full circulatory support to treat acute heart failure patients. We intend to continue to use
this experience to develop additional circulatory support products. Our research and development efforts are focused on developing a broader portfolio of products across the continuum of care in heart recovery, primarily focused in the area of
circulatory care. In addition, we have a number of new products at various stages of development some of which integrate the Impella technology platform.

As of March 31, 2015, our research and development staff consisted of 123 employees. We expended $36.0 million, $30.7 million and $25.6 million on research and development in fiscal years 2015, 2014
and 2013, respectively. Our research and development expenditures include costs related to clinical trials, including ongoing clinical studies for our Impella products.

Sales, Clinical Support, Marketing and Field Service

As of March 31,
2015, our worldwide sales, clinical support, marketing and field service teams included 235 full-time employees, 213 of whom are in the U.S. and Canada and 22 of whom are in Europe and Japan. Over the past five years, we have significantly increased
the number of our direct sales and clinical support personnel in the U.S and Europe.

Our clinical support personnel consist
primarily of registered nurses and other personnel with considerable experience in either the surgery suite or the cath lab, and they play a critical role in training current and prospective customers in the use of our products.

International sales (sales outside the U.S., primarily in Europe) accounted for 10%, 9% and 7% of total product revenue during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our products in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany. Our Aachen facility performs final assembly and manufactures
most of our Impella disposable products, including Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP. Our Danvers facility manufactures certain Impella subsystems and accessories, including our Automated Impella Console, or AIC, our
console for our Impella products, the AB5000, and Portable Driver. Beginning in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, we started producing the Impella CP product in our Danvers facility. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide us
with components used in our existing products and products under development. For example, we outsource some of the manufacturing for components and circuit cards within our consoles.

We believe our existing manufacturing facilities give us the necessary physical capacity to produce sufficient quantities of products to
meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months based on our current revenue forecast. We expect to continue to increase Impella manufacturing capacity in our Aachen and Danvers facilities in fiscal 2016 to support the growing demand for
our Impella products. Our U.S. and German manufacturing facilities are certified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and operate under the FDA’s good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the current
quality system regulation, or QSR.

Intellectual Property

We have developed significant know-how and proprietary technology, upon which our business depends. To protect our know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on trade secret laws, patents, copyrights,
trademarks, and confidentiality agreements and contracts. However, these methods afford only limited protection. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technology, gain access to our trade secrets or
disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval.

A substantial portion of our intellectual property rights
relating to the Impella products, AB5000, and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets, rather than patents. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees,
consultants and other parties. We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors.

We own or have rights to numerous U.S. and foreign patents. Our U.S. patents have expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2031 and our foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2032. We
also own or have rights to certain pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We believe patents will issue pursuant to such applications, but cannot guarantee it. Moreover, neither the timing of any issuance, the scope of protection, nor the
actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision. We have licensed patent rights from third parties in connection with which we are generally required to pay royalties.



Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. Our pending or future patent
applications may not be issued. The patents of others may render our patents obsolete, limit our ability to patent future innovations, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Because foreign patents may afford less
protection than U.S. patents, they may not adequately protect our technology.

The medical device industry is characterized by
a large number of patents and by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. If third parties successfully assert infringement or other claims
against us, we may not be able to sell our products or we may have to pay significant damages and ongoing royalties. In addition, patent or intellectual property disputes or litigation may be costly, result in product development delays, or divert
the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. If any such disputes or litigation arise, we may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement. However, such an arrangement may not be available on commercially acceptable
terms, if at all. We may decide, in the alternative, to litigate the claims or seek to design around the patented or otherwise protected proprietary technology.

The U.S. government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose technical data developed under government contracts that supported the development of some of our products. We retain the right to obtain
patents on any inventions developed under those contracts, provided we follow prescribed procedures and are subject to a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to the U.S. government.

Competition

Competition among providers of treatments for the failing heart is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving
industry requirements and standards. We compete with companies that have substantially greater or broader financial, product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than we do. Other advances in medical technology, biotechnology
and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for our products or render those products obsolete. Among our medical device competitors are Getinge (Maquet Cardiovascular), Teleflex Inc., Thoratec Corporation, HeartWare
International Inc., Terumo Heart, Inc. and CardiacAssist Inc.

Our customers are hospitals that have limited budgets. As a
result, our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies for these limited funds. Our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance our existing products, to develop new products to meet
regulatory and customer requirements, and to achieve market acceptance. We believe that important competitive factors with respect to the development and commercialization of our products include the relative speed with which we can develop
products, establish clinical utility, complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, obtain and protect reimbursement, maintain cost effectiveness for our products, and supply commercial quantities of our product to meet customer
demand.

Third-Party Reimbursement

Our products and services are generally purchased by healthcare institutions that rely on third-party payers to cover and reimburse the costs of related patient care. In the U.S., as well as in many
foreign countries, government-funded or private insurance programs pay the cost of a significant portion of a patient’s medical expenses. No uniform policy of coverage or reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payers.
Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer and by jurisdiction.

Third-party payers
may include government healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurers or managed care organizations. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, is responsible for administering the Medicare program in the U.S.
and, along with its contractors, establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business because a large percentage of the population
for which our products are intended includes elderly individuals who are Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure that government or private third-party
payers will continue to cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate.

Medicare payment may be made, in appropriate cases, for procedures performed in the in-patient hospital setting using our technology. Medicare generally reimburses healthcare institutions in which the
procedures are performed based upon prospectively determined amounts. For hospital in-patient stays, the prospective payment generally is determined by the patient’s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the
in-patient stay, using a classification system known as International Classification of Diseases, or ICD-9, and medical severity diagnosis-related groups, or MS DRGs. Prospective rates are adjusted for, among other things, regional differences,
co-morbidity and complications. Hospitals performing in-patient procedures using our devices generally do not receive separate Medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing or implanting our products. Rather, reimbursement for these
costs is bundled with the MS DRG-based payments made to hospitals for the procedures during which our devices are implanted, removed, repaired or replaced. Because prospective payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a
hospital’s actual costs in furnishing care, hospitals have incentives to lower their in-patient operating costs by utilizing products, devices and supplies that will reduce the length of in-patient stays, decrease labor or otherwise lower their
costs.

Medicare has announced plans to transition to a new system of ICD-10 in October 2015. CMS has stated that the
transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes is intended to provide more descriptive information about procedures used to deliver care to patients, and is not a mechanism



for remapping DRGs or changing payment. Recently CMS updated their description for Impella to use 5A02(1,2)1D: “Assistance with Cardiac Output Using Impeller Pump,” which continues to
map to DRG 216-221. We believe this is an accurate description/DRG assignment and do not expect changes. However future updates before and after implementation are possible.

Coverage and reimbursements for procedures to implant, remove, replace or repair our products are generally established in the U.S. market. For instance, Medicare covers the use of LVADs when used for
support of blood circulation post-cardiotomy, as a temporary life-support system until a human heart becomes available for transplant, or as destination therapy for patients who require permanent mechanical cardiac support, when the use is
consistent with FDA approval and FDA-approved labeling instructions, as applicable. Coverage and reimbursements for procedures to implant the Impella 2.5, CP, 5.0, or LD are also established for in-hospital use by Medicare including ICD-9 for
procedures and MS DRG coding. Actual coverage and payment may vary by local Medicare fiscal intermediary or third-party insurer. We also announced in 2013 recent coverage decisions by third party insurers including Aetna, Humana, Cigna, HCSC Blue
Cross Blue Shield, and United Healthcare, to include Impella policies in their commercial and/or Medicare plans.

In addition
to payments to hospitals for procedures using our technology, Medicare makes separate payments to physicians for their professional services when they perform surgeries to implant, remove, replace or repair our devices or when they perform
percutaneous insertion and removal of Impella. Physicians generally bill for such services using a coding system known as Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. Physician services performed in connection with the implantation, removal,
replacement or repair of our approved products are billed using a variety of CPT codes. Generally, Medicare payment levels for physician services are based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and are revised annually by CMS.

In general, third-party reimbursement programs in the U.S. and abroad, whether government-funded or commercially insured, are developing
a variety of increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, including prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, reducing benefit coverage, requiring second opinions prior to major surgery, negotiating
reductions to charges on patient bills, promoting healthier lifestyle initiatives and exploring more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. These types of cost-containment programs, as well as legislative or regulatory changes to
reimbursement policies, could limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our medical devices.

Government
Regulation

The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign
regulation. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject
to change.

Premarket Regulation

In the U.S., the FDA strictly regulates medical devices under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and its regulations. The FDA classifies U.S. medical devices into one of
three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the statutory framework described in the FFDCA. Class III devices, which are typically life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or new devices that have been found not to be substantially
equivalent to legally marketed devices. Class III devices must generally receive a PMA by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness.

The PMA approval pathway requires reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. The PMA approval pathway is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain
than the 510(k) path. In the PMA process, the FDA examines detailed data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the device. This information includes design, development, manufacture, labeling, advertising, preclinical testing and clinical study
data. Prior to approving a PMA, the FDA may conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities and the clinical sites where the supporting study was conducted. The facility inspection evaluates the company’s compliance with the Quality
System Regulation, or QSR. An inspection of clinical sites evaluates compliance with the IDE requirements. Typically, the FDA will convene an advisory panel meeting to seek review of the data presented in the PMA. The panel’s recommendation is
given substantial weight, but is not binding on the agency. By regulation, the FDA has 180 days to review a PMA application not requiring an advisory panel meeting, and 320 days to review a PMA application that does require an advisory panel
meeting. While the FDA has approved PMA applications within the allotted time period, reviews can occur over a significantly protracted period, usually 18 to 36 months, but sometimes longer, and a number of devices have never been approved for
marketing.

If the FDA’s evaluation is favorable, the PMA is approved and the device may be marketed in the U.S. The FDA
may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling and promotion, and post-market collection of clinical data. Failure to comply with
the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its
labeling or its manufacturing process. Even if a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, the FDA may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a device may be marketed. FDA enforcement policy prohibits the promotion
of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. In addition, product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing.



Certain Class III devices that were on the market before May 28, 1976, known as
pre-amendment Class III devices, and devices that are determined to be substantially equivalent to them, can be brought to market through the 510(k) process until the FDA, by regulation, calls for PMA applications for these devices. In addition, the
Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDAISIA) of 2012, requires the FDA either to down-classify pre-amendment Class III devices to Class I or Class II or to publish an
administrative order retaining the devices in Class III. Manufacturers of pre-amendment Class III devices that the FDA retains in Class III must submit a PMA application within 90 days after the FDA publishes a final order requiring premarket
approval for the device, or 30 months after final classification of the device, whichever is later. Failure to meet the deadline can lead the FDA to prevent continued marketing of the device during the PMA application review period. The Impella 2.5,
Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD received 510(k) clearance based on substantial equivalence to a pre-amendment Class III device. In December 2012, as part of the FDA’s 515 Program Initiative, an FDA panel voted to recommend continuation
of Class III status for temporary ventricular support devices within the non-roller type cardiopulmonary bypass blood pumps category, which includes our Impella products. The panel’s recommendation of Class III for this category of device is
consistent with the current Class III designation for these device types. The FDA accepted the panel’s recommendation and has issued a proposed administrative order reflecting this categorization.

During the 510(k) process, the FDA reviews a premarket notification and determines whether or not a proposed device is
“substantially equivalent” to “predicate devices.” If the intended use and technological characteristics are comparable to a predicate device, the device may be cleared for marketing. If the device has the same intended use as a
predicate device and different technological characteristics, but data is submitted to the FDA showing that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed device, it may also be cleared for marketing. The FDA’s 510(k)
clearance pathway usually takes three to 12 months, but it can often last longer and clearance is never assured. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. After a device receives
510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require PMA approval. The FDA requires each
manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the agency can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the
manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Additionally, the manufacturer may be subject
to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

In 2009, the FDA began implementing the 515 Program Initiative to facilitate
the potential reclassification of twenty-six medical device types that are currently considered Class III devices. Class I and II devices are generally considered to be lower risk than Class III devices and require clearance through the FDA’s
510(k) premarket notification process. Class III devices, however, are typically higher risk and first-of-a-kind and require approval through a PMA which is more costly and uncertain process to approval than the 510(k) premarket notification
process.

In December 2012, as part of the FDA’s 515 Program Initiative, an FDA panel voted to recommend continuation of
Class III status for temporary ventricular support devices within the non-roller type cardiopulmonary bypass blood pumps category, which includes our Impella products. The panel’s recommendation of Class III for this category of device is
consistent with the current Class III designation for these device types. The FDA accepted the panel’s recommendation and we worked with the FDA on the PMA application for our Impella 2.5 pump for use during high-risk PCI procedures. Under the
515 Program Initiative, we are permitted to continue to market our Impella products pursuant to the 510(k) clearance for a sufficient time to allow for the submission and review of PMA applications relating to our Impella products.

In March 2015, we received Pre-Market Approval, or PMA , from the FDA for Impella 2.5 during elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous
coronary intervention, or PCI, procedures. Impella 2.5 is the first hemodynamic support device to receive a PMA indication for use during high-risk PCI procedures, demonstrating its safety and effectiveness for this complex patient population. With
this approval, the Impella 2.5 is a temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left
ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during
planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce peri- and post-procedural adverse events. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision to leave Impella 2.5 in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours due to unforeseen
circumstances. Per our PMA approval, we will conduct a single-arm, post approval study on the Impella 2.5, collecting data on high-risk PCI patients. The study will be a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from 70 sites
supported with the Impella 2.5 system.

When clinical trials of a device are required in order to obtain FDA approval, the
sponsor of the trial is required to file an IDE application before commencing clinical trials. The FDA reviews and must approve an IDE before a study may begin in the U.S. In addition, the study must be approved by an Institutional Review Board, or
IRB, for each clinical site.

We are currently conducting the U.S. Impella registry, the first U.S. multicenter observational
registry collecting clinical data and outcomes for general use patients supported with the Impella 2.5, CP, and 5.0. The FDA, the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed or we, may suspend a clinical trial at any time
for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Following the completion of a study,
the data from the study must be collected, analyzed and presented in an appropriate submission to the FDA, either through an IDE, 510(k) premarket notification or a PMA.



In addition, certain medical devices can be approved by the FDA in the U.S. under an HDE
rather than a PMA. In order for a device to be eligible for an HDE, there must be a qualifying target patient population of less than 4,000 patients per year for which there is no other comparable device available to treat the condition. The FDA
must agree that a device meets these criteria before it can be approved under an HDE. To treat that qualifying patient population FDA approval of an HDE also requires demonstration that the device is safe for its intended application, that it is
potentially effective, and that the probable benefits outweigh the associated risks. Within the regulations for an HDE, if a device becomes available through the PMA process that addresses the same patient population as the HDE device, the HDE
device may need to be withdrawn from the U.S. market. An approved HDE authorizes sales of the device to any hospital after Institutional Review Board review and approval by the hospital. Proposed modifications to approved HDE devices, like
modifications to approved PMA devices, require FDA approval through a new HDE application or an HDE supplement.

We received
FDA approval for Impella RP under an HDE in January 2015. Impella RP is the first percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval. The Impella RP is a percutaneous device approved to provide support of
the right heart during times of acute failure for certain patients who have received a LVAD or have suffered heart failure due to AMI or a failed heart transplant.

Our AB5000 system is approved by the FDA for use in patients who have undergone successful cardiac surgery and subsequently develop low cardiac output, or patients who suffer from acute cardiac disorders
leading to hemodynamic instability. The intent of therapy is to provide circulatory support, restore normal hemodynamics, reduce ventricular work, and allow the heart time to recover adequate mechanical function. In April 2003, the AB5000
Circulatory Support System Console and in September 2003, the AB5000 VAD were approved under PMA supplements. We received FDA clearance for our IAB in December 2006. Our iPulse console was approved by the FDA under a PMA supplement in December 2007.
Our Impella 2.5 device received 510(k) clearance in June 2008 for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. We received FDA 510(k) clearance of our Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices in April 2009 for circulatory support for up to six hours.
Our AB Portable Driver received FDA approval under a PMA supplement in March 2009. All of these products have CE marks allowing distribution within the European Union. In September 2012, we announced that the Impella CP received 510(k) clearance
from the FDA for up to six hours of partial circulatory support using an extracorporeal bypass control unit. The Impella CP (previously marketed outside of the U.S. as Impella cVAD) received CE Mark approval to market the device in the European
Union in April 2012 and Health Canada approval to market the device in Canada in June 2012. . In April 2014, the Impella RP received CE Marking approval which allows for commercial sales of Impella RP in the EU and other countries that require a CE
Marking approval for sales.

Postmarket Regulation

The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by
the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA reviews design, manufacturing, and distribution practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experience and other information to identify potential
problems with marketed medical devices. Among other FDA requirements, we must comply with the FDA’s good manufacturing practice regulations. These regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design,
manufacture, packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. We must also comply with Medical Devices Reporting, or MDR, which requires us to report to the FDA any incident in any of our products that may have caused
or contributed to a death or serious injury, or required an unnecessary intervention for a patient, or in which any of our products malfunctioned and, if such malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious
injury. Labeling, advertising, and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for
unapproved uses. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with QSR and MDR requirements, as well as other applicable regulations. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with
applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair,
replacement, or refund of such devices, and require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and
restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal fines and penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion
of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If the FDA or another regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training
or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered
off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion.

In June 2011, we received a warning letter from the FDA stating that some of our promotional materials marketed the Impella 2.5 for uses that had not been approved by the FDA. We cooperated with the FDA
and made changes to our promotional materials in response to the warning letter. However, in April 2012, we received a follow up letter from the FDA stating that some of our promotional materials continued to market the Impella 2.5 in ways that are
not compliant with FDA regulations. After additional action by us, we received a close-out letter in February 2013 from the FDA with respect to this matter, which noted that the FDA’s Office of Compliance had completed its review of the
corrective actions we took in response to the warning letter and that the concerns cited appeared to have been addressed.



On October 26, 2012, we were informed that the Department of Justice, United States
Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia was conducting an investigation, or the “Marketing and Labeling Investigation” focused on our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5. On October 31, 2012, we accepted service of a
subpoena related to this investigation seeking documents related to the Impella 2.5. We believe that we have substantially complied with the subpoena and have submitted the requested documents to the United States Attorney’s Office. On
September 13, 2013, we entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorney’s Office, pursuant to which we and the United States Attorney’s Office mutually agreed to toll the applicable statutes of limitations for all
criminal, civil and administrative offenses and violations that could be charged or claimed against us as of that date. On May 27, 2014 and January 30, 2015, we executed extensions of the tolling agreement. These extensions expired on
March 2, 2015. The investigation is ongoing and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or determine whether a liability has been incurred or make an estimate of the reasonably possible liability, if any, that could result from any
unfavorable outcome associated with this investigation. We have incurred significant expenses related to this investigation and we could continue to incur additional expenses in the future related to this action.

On April 25, 2014, we received a subpoena from the Boston regional office of the United States Department of Health and Human
Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General requesting materials relevant to our reimbursement of expenses and remuneration to healthcare providers for a six month period from July 2012 through December 2012 in connection with a civil
investigation under the False Claims Act (the “FCA Investigation” and, together with the Marketing and Labeling Investigation, the “DOJ Investigations”). We submitted the requested documents to HHS and believe that we have
substantially complied with the subpoena. On November 6, 2014, we received notice from the Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts in the form of a Civil Investigative Demand
(“CID”) requesting additional materials relating to this matter for the time period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. We are currently in the process of responding to the additional requests for information contained
in the CID and intend to continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in connection with the FCA investigation.

The FDA often requires post-market surveillance, or PMS, for significant risk devices, such as VADs, that require ongoing collection of
clinical data during commercialization that must be gathered, analyzed and submitted to the FDA periodically for up to several years. The PMS data collection requirements are often burdensome and expensive and have an effect on the PMA approval
status. The failure to comply with the FDA’s regulations can result in enforcement action, including seizure of products, injunction, prosecution, civil fines and penalties, recall and/or suspension of FDA approval. The export of devices such
as ours is also subject to regulation in certain instances.

The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection,
or CBP, administers controls over the import and export of medical devices into and out of the U.S. The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of medical devices, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. The
FDA also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the U.S. International sales of our medical devices that have not received FDA approval are therefore subject to FDA export requirements.

Fraud and Abuse Laws

Our business is regulated by laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by significant criminal and civil
sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Because of the far-reaching nature of these laws, we may be required to alter one or more of our practices
to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could adversely affect our arrangements with customers and physicians. In addition, any violation of these laws or regulations
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Anti-Kickback Statute

Subject to a number of statutory exceptions, the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons
from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, recommending, purchasing,
leasing, ordering, or arranging for, a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value,
including gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything of value at less than fair market value. The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, or the OIG, and the Department of Justice are responsible for enforcing the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute and the OIG is primarily responsible for identifying fraud and abuse activities affecting government
healthcare programs.

Penalties for violating the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute include substantial
criminal fines and/or imprisonment, substantial civil fines and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal healthcare programs
Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs and do not include comparable exceptions to those provided by the federal
healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute.

The OIG has issued safe harbor regulations that identify activities and business
relationships that are deemed safe from prosecution under the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute. There are safe harbors for various types of arrangements, including certain investment interests, leases, personal service arrangements,
discounts and management contracts. The failure of a particular activity to comply with all



requirements of an applicable safe harbor regulation does not mean that the activity violates the federal healthcare programs Anti-Kickback Statute or that prosecution will be pursued. However,
activities and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG.

In recent years, the federal government and several states have enacted legislation requiring biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical
device companies to establish marketing compliance programs and file periodic reports on sales, marketing, and other activities. Similar legislation is being considered in other states. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and available
guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could harm our business, if it is alleged that we have failed to fully comply with such laws and regulations.
Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities that we do business with are found to have not complied with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business.

Federal False Claims Act

The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. A claim that is filed
pursuant to an unlawful kickback may be a false claim under this law. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory
civil penalties for each separate false claim. Private individuals can file suits under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These lawsuits are known as “qui tam” actions, and the individuals bringing such suits, sometimes
known as “relators” or, more commonly, “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims
Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs
as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.

HIPAA

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false
statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute
is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false,
fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.

HIPAA also protects the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare
providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates. HIPAA restricts the use and disclosure of patient health information, including patient records. Although we believe that HIPAA does not apply to us directly, most
of our customers have significant obligations under HIPAA, and we intend to cooperate with our customers and others to ensure compliance with HIPAA with respect to patient information that comes into our possession. Failure to comply with HIPAA
obligations can result in civil fines and/or criminal penalties. Some states have also enacted rigorous laws or regulations protecting the security and privacy of patient information. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could
face additional sanctions.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act

In March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act, or together, the Affordable Care Act. The law includes provisions that, among other things, reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions) and impose increased
taxes. Specifically, the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices beginning in 2013. We began paying the medical device excise tax in
January 2013. We expect that the excise tax will continue to impact our operating expenses in the future. Because many other parts of the Affordable Care Act remain subject to implementation, the long-term impact to us is uncertain. The new law or
any future legislation could reduce medical procedure volumes, lower reimbursement for our products, and impact the demand for our products or the prices at which we sell our products.

The Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or PPSA, which requires manufacturers of
drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to CMS, for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements
have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. Particularly, some states such as
Massachusetts and Vermont impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. We have reported the information as required by the PPSA for the period from
August 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014.



Additionally, the compliance environment is changing, with more states, such as California,
Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, requiring reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation
and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting regulatory environment, along with the requirement to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements, increases the possibility that a company may run afoul of
one or more laws.

International Regulation

We are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign countries in which we sell our products. Many of the regulations applicable to
our products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The European Union requires that our medical devices comply with the Medical Device Directive or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, which includes quality system and CE
certification requirements. To obtain a CE Mark in the European Union, defined products must meet minimum standards of safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements) and then undergo an appropriate conformity assessment procedure. A Notified
Body assesses the quality management systems of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirements within the Medical Device Directive. In the European Union, we are also required to maintain certain ISO
certifications in order to sell our products. Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP, Impella RP, AB5000, BVS 5000, IAB, iPulse console and Portable Driver are all approved under CE mark and are available for sale in the European
Union. We are also subject to regulations and periodic review from various regulatory bodies in Canada, Japan and other countries where we sell our products. Lack of regulatory compliance in any of these jurisdictions could limit our ability to
distribute products in these countries.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and
their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are, either directly or indirectly, with
governmental entities and employees (such as physicians) and are therefore subject to various anti-bribery laws. Although our corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have
experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from
reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Other Regulations

We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use,
handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities. Specifically, the manufacture of our biomaterials is subject to compliance with federal
environmental regulations and by various state and local agencies. Although we believe we are in compliance with these laws and regulations in all material respects, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs
to comply with these and other laws or regulations in the future.

Seasonality

Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors, including new product introductions, acquisitions, regulatory approvals, patient
and physician holiday schedules, and other factors. Net sales in the first half of our fiscal year are typically lower than the second half of our fiscal year due to the seasonality of the United States and European markets, where summer vacation
schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures.

Employees

As of March 31, 2015, we had 589 full-time employees, including:

•

123 in product engineering, research and development, and regulatory;

•

235 in sales, clinical support, marketing, field service and related support;

•

174 in manufacturing; and

•

57 in general and administration.



We routinely enter into contractual agreements with our employees, which typically include
confidentiality and non-competition commitments. Our employees are not represented by unions. We consider our employee relations to be good. If we were unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, our operations could be
negatively impacted.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as the other information we include or incorporate
by reference in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. If any of these risks materializes, the trading price of our common
stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment.

This section includes or refers to forward-looking
statements. You should read the explanation of the qualifications and limitations of such forward-looking statements discussed at the beginning of the report.

Risks Related to Our Business

If we fail to obtain and maintain necessary
governmental approvals for our products and indications, we may be unable to market and sell our products in certain jurisdictions.

Medical devices such as ours are extensively regulated by the FDA in the U.S. and by other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Governmental regulations relate to the testing, development,
manufacturing, labeling, design, sale, promotion, distribution, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. In the U.S., before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing
product, we must generally first receive either PMA approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Both of these processes can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant expenses, primarily related to clinical trials. The FDA’s 510(k)
clearance process usually takes between three to twelve months, but it can often last longer.

The process of obtaining a
PMA approval is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. It generally takes between one to three years, or even longer, from the time the PMA application is submitted to the FDA. We cannot assure you that any regulatory
clearances or approvals, either foreign or domestic, will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for use of our products under development, or if the patient populations for which they
are approved are not sufficiently broad, the commercial success of these products could be limited. The FDA may also limit the claims that we can make about our products. Our devices will increasingly be subject to the PMA and HDE processes as it
converts its Impella products from 510(k) clearance to the PMA approvals which were called for under the FDA 515 program. The FDA has indicated it will allow for all Impella products to remain on the market while this conversion takes place. Once
approved, any significant modifications to the design, materials, or intended use of those devices will require FDA approval through PMA or HDE supplemental applications, and the devices will be subject to more burdensome regulatory reporting
requirements than they have been as 510(k) cleared devices.

If we do not receive FDA approval or clearance for one or more of
our products, we will be unable to market and sell those products in the U.S. which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects.

We intend to market our products in international markets, including the European Union, Canada, and Japan. Approval processes differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the U.S. or any other single
jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in any other jurisdiction. Obtaining foreign approvals could involve significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could require additional clinical trials.

If the FDA or another regulatory or enforcement agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various
penalties, including civil or criminal penalties. We have received an administrative subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice which is conducting an investigation that is focused on our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5 device.

The FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General
and other regulatory or enforcement agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label use and the promotion of medical products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained. If any such agency determines that our
promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter,
injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, such agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label
promotion. In June 2011 we received a warning letter from the FDA stating that some of our promotional materials marketed the Impella 2.5 for uses that had not been approved by the FDA. We cooperated with the FDA and made changes to our promotional
materials in response to the warning letter. However, in April 2012, we received a follow-up letter from the FDA stating that some of our promotional materials continued to market the Impella 2.5 in ways that are not compliant with FDA regulations.
After additional actions by us, we



received a close-out letter in February 2013 from the FDA with respect to this matter, which noted that the FDA’s Office of Compliance had completed its review of the corrective actions we
took in response to the warning letter and that the concerns cited appeared to have been addressed. The close-out letter, however, provides no assurance that there may not be other occurrences that may be subject to regulatory or enforcement action.

On October 26, 2012, we were informed that the Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the
District of Columbia was conducting an investigation, or the “Marketing and Labeling Investigation”, focused on our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5. On October 31, 2012, we accepted service of a subpoena related to this
investigation seeking documents related to the Impella 2.5. We believe that we have substantially complied with the subpoena and have submitted the requested documents to the United States Attorney’s Office. On September 13, 2013, we
entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorney’s Office, pursuant to which we and the United States Attorney’s Office mutually agreed to toll the applicable statutes of limitations for all criminal, civil and
administrative offenses and violations that could be charged or claimed against us as of that date. On May 27, 2014 and January 30, 2015, we executed extensions of the tolling agreement. These extensions expired on March 2, 2015. The
investigation is ongoing and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome or determine whether a liability has been incurred or make an estimate of the reasonably possible liability, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome associated
with this investigation. We have incurred significant expenses related to this investigation and we could continue to incur additional expenses in the future related to this action.

We may not be able to resolve these matters, or any similar matters that may come up in the future, without incurring penalties or facing
significant consequences. Even if we are successful in resolving this matter without incurring penalties, responding to the subpoena has resulted and in the future could result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our
reputation and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations.

Off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.

The use of our products outside the indications cleared for use, or “off-label use,” may increase the risk
of injury to patients. Clinicians may use our products for off-label uses, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a clinician’s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Off-label use of our products may increase the risk of
product liability claims against us. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management’s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.

We have historically been named as a party to purported stockholder class actions and a derivative action, and we may be named in additional litigation in the future, which may require significant
management time and attention, and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

On June 10, 2014, U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, or the First Circuit affirmed the dismissal by the U.S. District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, or the District Court, of a previously disclosed complaint brought by an alleged stockholder as a derivative action instituted on our behalf against each of our directors. The complaint alleged that the
directors breached their fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders in connection with disclosures related to our marketing and labeling of its Impella 2.5 product and sought damages in an unspecified amount. On February 6, 2015, the First
Circuit, affirmed the dismissal by the District Court of a previously disclosed complaint brought by alleged purchasers of our common stock, on behalf of themselves and persons or entities that purchased or acquired our common stock between
August 5, 2011 and October 31, 2012. The complaint related to two previously reported complaints that were filed on November 16 and 19, 2012 and alleged that we and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws in
connection with disclosures related to our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5 product and sought damages in an unspecified amount. We do not expect any further activity related to this matter or the derivative action.

We may continue to be the subject of class action or derivative actions, which we intend to defend vigorously. We cannot be assured,
however, that we will be successful. We may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers and directors from damage awards that may be entered against them or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. Any
such payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. Even if the plaintiffs’ claims are not successful, defending litigation could result in substantial costs
and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations.

Our current and planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, and may not be completed on schedule, or at all.

In order to obtain PMA approval and in some cases, 510(k) clearance, we may be required to conduct well-controlled
clinical trials designed to test the safety and effectiveness of the product. In order to conduct clinical studies, we must generally receive an IDE for each device from the FDA. An IDE allows us to use an investigational device in a clinical trial
to collect data on safety and effectiveness that will support an application for premarket approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA.



Conducting clinical trials is a long, expensive and uncertain process that is subject to
delays and failure at any stage. Clinical trials can take months or years to complete. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including:

•

the FDA may not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or may place a clinical trial on hold;

•

subjects may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect and/or subjects may not be followed-up on at the rate we expect;

•

subjects may experience adverse side effects or events related or unrelated to our products;

•

third-party clinical investigators may not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and
good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;

•

the interim results of any of our clinical trials may be inconclusive or negative;

•

regulatory inspections of our clinical trials may require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials if
investigators find us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements;

•

510(k) clearance of our devices may have the effect of slowing down the progress of related clinical trials since physicians can use our cleared
devices commercially outside of the trials;

•

our manufacturing process may not produce finished products that conform to design and performance specifications expected with the clinical trial; or

•

governmental regulations or administrative actions may change and impose new requirements, particularly with respect to reimbursement for products used
in clinical trials.

The results of pre-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial
results and previous clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. We may suffer delays and cost overruns, and terminate manufacturing of certain of our products despite achieving promising results in pre-clinical testing
or early clinical testing. In addition, the data obtained from clinical trials may be inadequate to support approval or clearance of a submission. The FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our clinical trials, or may find the
clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which could further delay approval
of our products. The FDA or other international regulatory agencies will require post-market studies which can be burdensome and expensive. Per our PMA approval, the FDA has required that we conduct a single-arm, post approval study on the Impella
2.5, collecting data on high-risk PCI patients. The study will be a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from 70 sites supported with the Impella 2.5 system. If we are unable to receive FDA approval of an IDE to conduct clinical
trials or the trials are halted by the FDA or others or if we are unsuccessful in receiving FDA approval of a product candidate, we would not be able to sell or promote the product candidate in the U.S., which could seriously harm our business.
Moreover, we face similar risks in each jurisdiction in which we sell or propose to sell our products. If we make modifications to a product, whether in response to results of clinical testing or otherwise, we could be required to start our clinical
trials over, which could cause serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations. Even modest changes to certain components of our products could result in months or years of additional clinical trials.

Our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including continuing regulatory review, which could affect the manufacturing and
marketing of our products.

The FDA and other regulatory agencies continue to review products even after they have
received initial approval. If and when the FDA or another regulatory agency clears or approves our products under development, the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation, including compliance with the
FDA’s adverse event reporting requirements, prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses, and QSR requirements, which obligate manufacturers, including third-party and contract manufacturers, to adhere to stringent design, testing,
control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the design and manufacture of a device.

Any modification
to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this
determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any such decision. Modifications of this type are common with new products. We anticipate that the first generation of each of our products will undergo a number of changes, refinements,
enhancements and improvements over time. If the FDA requires us to seek clearance or approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease
marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position. We
also cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications, if required. We and our third-party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA and
other regulatory agencies for QSR and other requirements, the interpretation of which can change. Compliance with QSR and similar legal requirements can be difficult and expensive. Enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government
requirements



could result in fines, suspensions of approvals or clearances, recalls or seizure of products, operating restrictions or shutdown, and criminal prosecutions that could adversely affect the
manufacture and marketing of our products. The FDA or another regulatory agency could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information, including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements,
the occurrence of unanticipated problems with products following approval, or other reasons, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, our products may be subject to product recalls which may harm our reputation and divert our managerial and financial resources.

The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to order mandatory recall of our
products or order their removal from the market if the government finds that our products might cause adverse health consequences or death. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing
errors or design defects, including labeling defects. We have in the past initiated voluntary recalls of some of our products and we could do so in the future. Any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial
and financial resources.

We depend on third-party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products. If third-party
payers fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for purchase and use of our products, our sales and profitability would be adversely affected.

Sales of medical devices largely depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Without the financial support of government
reimbursement or third-party insurers’ payments for patient care, the market for our products will be limited. Medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine
whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement, and if so, the level of reimbursement which may apply.

We
cannot be sure that additional third-party payers will cover and/or adequately reimburse sales of our products or other products under development, to enable us to sell them at profitable prices.

In addition, third-party payers are increasingly requiring evidence that medical devices are cost-effective and if we are unable to meet
this requirement, the third-party payer may not reimburse the use of our products, which could reduce sales of our products to healthcare providers who depend upon reimbursement for payment. We also cannot be sure that third-party payers will
continue the current level of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of our products. Any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business.

Changes in healthcare reimbursement systems in the U.S. and abroad could reduce our revenues and profitability.

In March 2010, the federal government enacted healthcare reform legislation. The legislation has changed the manner in which healthcare services are provided and paid for in the U.S. These changes may
impact reimbursement for healthcare services, including reimbursement to hospitals and physicians. States may also enact further legislation that impacts Medicaid payments to hospitals and physicians. In addition, CMS, the federal agency responsible
for administering the Medicare program in the U.S., has established payment levels for hospitals and physicians in line with the legislation, which can increase or decrease payment to such entities.

The healthcare reform legislation and any future legislative, regulatory and reimbursement initiatives or changes to the reimbursement
for our products could adversely affect demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our revenues. Our business and results of operations could therefore be adversely affected by the healthcare reform legislation as well as future
healthcare reform or regulatory actions.

Internationally, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to
country, with some countries limiting medical centers spending through fixed budgets, regardless of levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third-party reimbursement. Even if we
succeed in bringing our new products to market, uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at
profitable prices.

We must comply with healthcare “fraud and abuse” laws, and we could face substantial penalties for
non-compliance and be excluded from government healthcare programs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights may be applicable to our business. We may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse
regulation and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

•

The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving or providing
remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce (i) the referral of an individual, for an item or service, or (ii) the recommending, purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare
programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;



•

The Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare,
Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, including claims made pursuant to an unlawful kickback, and which may apply to entities like us that promote medical devices, provide medical device management services and may
provide coding and billing advice to customers;

•

HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which
also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and

•

State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by
any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ in significant ways from state to state and often are not preempted by
HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Additionally, the compliance environment is changing, with
more states, such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, requiring reporting to state
governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or PPSA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, requires manufacturers of drug, device, biologics, and medical supplies covered
under Medicare, Medicaid, or State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, to report payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals on an annual basis to the HHS. These laws all provide for penalties for non-compliance. The shifting
regulatory environment, along with the requirement to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements, increases the possibility that we may run afoul of one or more laws.

Many of these requirements are new and their application is uncertain, and regulatory guidance is limited. We could face enforcement
action, fines and other penalties and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could harm our business, if it is alleged that we have failed to fully comply with such laws and regulations. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or
entities that we do business with are found not to comply with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business.

On April 25, 2014, we received a subpoena from the Boston regional office of HHS, OIG requesting materials relevant to our
reimbursement of expenses and remuneration to healthcare providers for a six month period from July 2012 through December 2012 in connection with a civil investigation under the False Claims Act (the “FCA Investigation” and, together with
the Marketing and Labeling Investigation, the “DOJ Investigations”). We submitted the requested documents to HHS and believe that we have substantially complied with the subpoena. On November 6, 2014, we received notice from the
Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts in the form of a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) requesting additional materials relating to this matter for the time period of
January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. We are currently in the process of responding to the additional requests for information contained in the CID and intend to continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in connection
with the FCA investigation.

We depend on Impella products for a significant portion of our revenues.

We derive, and expect to continue to derive, most of our revenues from sales of our Impella products. While we cannot fully predict what
level of revenues our Impella products will generate, we anticipate that Impella product sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Implementation of our business strategy depends on continued
sales of our Impella products. Our ability to generate sales of our Impella products may be impaired by the factors described below:

•

our failure to obtain approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities or to comply with government regulations, or the withdrawal of market
clearance or the taking of other enforcement actions;

•

lack of acceptance or continued acceptance by physicians;

•

our reliance on specialized suppliers for certain components and materials;

•

manufacturing or quality control problems;

•

our inability to protect our proprietary technologies or an infringement of others’ patents;

•

the loss of a distributor or a distributor’s failure to perform its obligations;

•

our failure to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors;

•

additional risks associated with selling in international markets;

•

long and variable sales and deployment cycles;

•

failure by third-party payers to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement;

•

our failure to comply with federal and state regulations; and

•

product liability claims.



If we fail to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, our sales or
operating results may be harmed.

Competition from other companies offering circulatory care products is intense and
subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. We compete with companies that have substantially greater or broader financial, product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than we do. Our
ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:

•

the availability of other products and procedures that are technically equivalent or superior to our products, and which may be sold at lower prices;

•

product performance and design;

•

product safety;

•

sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;

•

comparable clinical outcomes;

•

success and timing of new product development and introductions;

•

penetration into existing and new geographic markets; and

•

intellectual property protection.

Our customers are primarily hospitals that have limited budgets. As a result, our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies for these limited funds. Our success will
depend in large part upon our ability to enhance our existing products, to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance for our products. We believe that important competitive factors with
respect to the development and commercialization of our products include the relative speed with which we can develop products, establish clinical utility, complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, obtain and protect reimbursement,
maintain cost effectiveness for our products, and supply commercial quantities of our products to our customers.

Advances in
medical technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for our products or render those products obsolete. We are aware of other heart replacement device research efforts in the U.S., Canada, Europe and
Japan. In addition, there are a number of companies; including Getinge, Thoratec Corporation, CardiacAssist, HeartWare International, Terumo Heart and several early-stage companies, that are developing heart assist products, including implantable
left ventricular assist devices and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices.

If we do not effectively manage our growth, we may
be unable to successfully develop, market and sell our products.

Our future revenue and operating results will depend
on our ability to manage the anticipated growth of our business. We have experienced significant growth in recent years in the scope of our operations and we have increased our employee headcount. This growth has placed significant demands on our
management as well as our financial and operations resources. In order to achieve our business objectives, we will need to continue to grow. However, continued growth presents numerous challenges, including:

•

developing our global sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities;

•

expanding manufacturing capacity, maintaining quality and increasing production;

•

increasing our foreign and domestic regulatory compliance capabilities;

•

implementing appropriate operational, financial and IT systems and internal controls;

•

identifying, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly experienced clinical staff; and

•

training, managing and supervising our personnel worldwide.

Any failure to manage our growth effectively could impede our ability to successfully develop, market and sell our products, which could seriously harm our business.

The demand for some of our products and products under development is unproven, and we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products.

Our products and products under development may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success, which could adversely
affect our business and operational results. We need to create markets for our Impella products and other existing products, as well as other new or future products, including achieving market acceptance among physicians, hospitals, patients
and third-party payers. In particular, we need to gain acceptance of our Impella products among interventional cardiologists. The obstacles we will face in trying to create successful commercial markets for our products include:

•

limitations inherent in first-generation devices, and our potential inability to develop successive improvements, including increases in service life
and improvements in the ease of use of our products;



•

introduction by other companies of new treatments, products and technologies that compete with our products;

•

timing and amount of reimbursement for these products, if any, by third-party payers;

•

potential reluctance of clinicians to obtain adequate training to use our products;

•

cost of our products; and

•

potential reluctance of physicians, patients and society as a whole to accept medical devices that replace or assist the heart and risk of mechanical
failure inherent in such devices.

Our future success depends in part on the development of new circulatory assist
products, and our development efforts may not be successful.

We are devoting most of our research and development and
regulatory efforts, and significant financial resources, to the development of our Impella products and product extensions of existing commercial products and new products. In July 2014, we acquired ECP, a German limited liability company engaged in
the research, development, prototyping and pre-serial production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft. The development of new products and product extensions
presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas, including blood compatible surfaces, blood compatible flow, manufacturing techniques, pumping mechanisms, physiological control, energy transfer, anatomical fit and surgical techniques. We may be
unable to overcome all of these challenges, which could adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.

The commercial
success of our products will require acceptance by surgeons and interventional cardiologists, a limited number of whom have significant influence over medical device selection and purchasing decisions.

We may achieve our business objectives only if our products are accepted and recommended by leading cardiovascular surgeons and
interventional cardiologists, whose decisions are likely to be based on a determination by these clinicians that our products are safe and cost-effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment. Although we have developed relationships with
leading cardiac surgeons, the commercial success of Impella and our other products will require that we also develop relationships with leading interventional cardiologists in cath labs. We cannot assure you that we can maintain our existing
relationships and arrangements or that we can establish new relationships in support of our products. If cardiovascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac
patient population or if a sufficient number of these clinicians recommend and use competing products, it would seriously harm our business.

Expansion into hospitals that have not historically used our products may incur long sales and training cycles that may cause our product sales and
operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.

Our products have lengthy sales cycles and we may
incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant effort without making a sale. Even after making the decision to purchase our Impella products, our customers often deploy our products slowly. In addition, cardiac centers that
buy the majority of our products are usually led by cardiac surgeons who are heavily recruited by competing centers or by centers looking to increase their profiles. When one of these surgeons moves to a new center we sometimes experience a
temporary but significant reduction in purchases by the hospital that the surgeon previously worked in while it replaces its lead surgeon. As a result, our product sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In
addition, product purchases often lag initial expressions of interest in our product by new centers as training of the products and internal hospital administrative procedures are typically required prior to the initial implant procedures.

The training required for clinicians to use our products could reduce the market acceptance of our products and reduce our revenue.

Clinicians must be trained to use our products proficiently. It is critical to the success of our business that we
ensure that there are a sufficient number of clinicians familiar with, trained on and proficient in the use of our products. Convincing clinicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary to obtain adequate training in the use of our products is
challenging and we may not be successful in these efforts. If clinicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. Any improper use of our products may result in unsatisfactory outcomes, patient injury, negative
publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could harm our reputation and affect future product sales. Furthermore, our inability to educate and train clinicians to use our products may lead to lower demand for our products.

If we are unable to develop additional, high-quality manufacturing capacity, our growth may be limited and our business could be seriously harmed.

To be successful, we believe we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity. We do not have experience in
manufacturing our Impella products in the commercial quantities that might be required to meet potential demand, nor do we have experience manufacturing our other products in large quantities. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up
manufacturing of our products, including problems related to



product yields, quality control and assurance, component and service availability, dependable sources of supply, adequacy of internal control policies and procedures and lack of skilled
personnel. If we cannot hire, train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical workers, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our existing or future products on-time and at an acceptable cost, which could
limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business. In order for our manufacturing to meet the expected demand for our Impella products, we have been implementing process improvements on the Impella production line at our
manufacturing facilities in Aachen, Germany and Danvers, Massachusetts to increase the output that we can produce at the facility. In addition to programs designed to further increase yield and capacity levels, we have expanded manufacturing
employment in Aachen and Danvers and have increased manufacturing floor space in Danvers and Aachen. We have relocated selected Impella sub-assembly production to our manufacturing facility in Danvers, Massachusetts and we began production of the
Impella CP in Danvers to support manufacturing at our main Impella production facility in Aachen. We continue to work on initiatives to expand our Impella manufacturing capacity in both Aachen and Danvers. We are also working with our existing
suppliers and new suppliers to ensure we are able to have sufficient inventory and sub assembly parts as we increase our manufacturing capability to support growing demand. If we are unable to implement these process improvements on a timely basis,
it could inhibit our revenue growth.

Any failure to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require may
seriously harm our business.

Our products require precise, high-quality manufacturing. Achieving precision and
quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel. Any failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, design defects or component failures, could result in patient
injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business. Despite our very high manufacturing standards, we cannot completely eliminate
the risk of errors, defects or failures. If we are unable to manufacture our products in accordance with necessary quality standards, or if we are unable to procure additional high-quality manufacturing facilities, our business and results of
operations may be negatively affected.

If we cannot attract and retain key management, scientific, sales and other personnel we need,
we will not be successful.

We depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our business,
financial, technical, sales and support, regulatory and clinical, operating, manufacturing and administrative management and staff, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our key personnel include our senior officers, many of whom have very
specialized scientific, medical or operational knowledge. The loss of the service of any of the key members of our senior management team may significantly delay or prevent our achievement of our business objectives. Our ability to attract and
retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors is critical to our success. For example, many of the members of our clinical staff are registered nurses with experience in the surgery suite or cath lab, of which only a limited number of whom
seek employment with a company like ours. Competition for skilled and experienced personnel in the medical devices industry is intense. We face competition for skilled and experienced management, scientific, clinical, engineering and sales personnel
from numerous medical device and life sciences companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions. If we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff, or if we are unable to attract and
retain qualified personnel in the future, especially scientific and sales personnel, our business could be adversely affected.

If our
suppliers cannot provide the components we require, our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed.

We rely
on third-party suppliers to provide us with some components used in our existing products and products under development. For example, we outsource the manufacturing of most of our consoles other than final assembly and testing and the sterilization
process for our products. Relying on third-party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures or obsolescence and to interruptions in supply, either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to
our customers on a timely basis. Using third-party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components, such as components on circuit boards, maintain quality control, manage inventory and production schedules
and control production costs. Manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with the FDA or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components.
Any failure by a supplier to comply with applicable requirements could lead to a disruption in supply. Vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and often can exceed six months or more. Both now and as we expand our
manufacturing capacity, we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us required components when we need them or be able to provide us inventory materials to support our expected growth in demand for our products. These factors could make it
more difficult for us to manufacture our products effectively and efficiently and could adversely impact our results of operations.

Some of our suppliers may be the only source for a particular component, which makes us vulnerable to significant cost increases. We have many foreign suppliers for some of our parts in which we are
subject to currency exchange rate volatility. Some of our vendors are small in size and may have difficulty supplying the quantity and quality of materials required for our products as our business grows. Vendors that are the sole source of certain
products may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain components due to product liability or other concerns and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products. Our inventory may run out before we find alternative
suppliers and we might be forced to purchase substantial inventory, if available, to last until we are able to qualify an alternate supplier. If we cannot obtain a necessary component, we may need to find, test and obtain regulatory approval or
clearance for a replacement component, produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product, which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs. Any of these events could adversely impact our results of
operations.



General economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.

External factors can affect our profitability and financial condition. Such external factors include general domestic
and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding healthcare in general. While the economic environment has
shown some signs of improvement, the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business. For example, an increase in interest rates
could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets. Negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working
capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow. Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition. These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.

We do business with foreign governments outside the United States. A number of these countries, including certain European countries,
have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it
takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.

We may not be successful in expanding our direct sales activities
into international markets.

We are seeking to expand our international sales of our products by recruiting direct
sales and support teams outside the U.S. Our international operations in Germany, France, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom are or will be subject to a number of risks, which may vary from the risks we experience in the U.S., including:

•

the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used;

•

the need to procure reimbursement for our products in each foreign market;

•

the generally lower level of reimbursement available in foreign markets relative to the U.S.;

•

longer sales cycles;

•

limited protection of intellectual property rights;

•

difficulty and delays in collecting accounts receivable;

•

different income tax and sales tax environments;

•

difficulty in supporting patients using our products;

•

different payroll, employee benefits and statutory requirements;

•

fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies; and

•

political and economic instability.

If we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.

We intend to expand our reliance on distributors in some international markets and poor performance by a distributor could reduce our sales and harm our business.

We rely on distributors to market and sell our products in certain parts of Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. Many of
these distributors have the exclusive right to distribute our products in their territory. We may hire distributors to market our products in additional international markets. Our success in these markets will depend almost entirely upon the efforts
of our distributors, over whom we have little or no control. If a distributor does not market and sell our products aggressively and maintain a continued focus on the sale and distribution of our products, we could lose sales and impair our ability
to compete in that market. We are also subject to credit risk associated with shipments to our distributors and this could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity in the future.

Many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities, and we could be
adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws outside the United States.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign
government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and employees



(such as physicians) and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Although our corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti- bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world
that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us
from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We have incurred losses in previous periods and it is possible that we may incur losses in future periods.

We have recognized net income of approximately $113.7 million, $7.4 million and $15.0 million for the years ended
March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The profitability we achieved in recent years may not be indicative of our ability to sustain profitability and it is possible that we may incur losses from operations in future periods. The increase
in net income for the year ended March 31, 2015 was primarily due to the income tax benefit of $84.9 million primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets in the quarter ended March 31, 2015.
Although we have been profitable in recent years, it is possible that we may incur losses in future periods. Any losses incurred in the future may result primarily from, among other things:

•

the expansion of our global distribution network;

•

investments in new markets such as Japan;

•

ongoing product and clinical development;

•

costs related to new business development initiatives;

•

legal and other expenses related to our compliance with the subpoena received from the U.S. Department of Justice in October 2012, the subpoena we
received from the Boston regional office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General in April 2014, civil investigative demand, or CID we received from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of
Massachusetts in November 2014 and our defense of other legal claims;

•

U.S. medical device taxes on the sales of certain of our products in the U.S.;

•

costs associated with hiring additional personnel, performing clinical trials, continuing our research and development relating to our products under
development, seeking regulatory approvals and, if we receive these approvals, commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing activities; and

•

Significant expenditures necessary to market and manufacture in commercial quantities our approved circulatory care products.

•

The amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately and cost overruns may occur.

Our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably.

Historically, our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely and we expect these fluctuations to continue. Among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are:

•

the timing of customer orders and deliveries;

•

competitive changes, such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make;

•

the timing of regulatory actions, such as product approvals or recalls;

•

costs we incur developing and testing our Impella heart pumps and other products;

•

costs we incur in anticipation of future sales, such as inventory purchases, expansion of manufacturing facilities, or establishment of international
sales offices;

•

costs we incur in connection with the class action suits and derivative action that has been filed against us;

•

costs we incur in connection with the investigation being conducted by the DOJ;

•

additional taxes, such as the Medical Device tax;

•

timing of certain marketing programs and events;

•

impact of any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future;

•

economic conditions in the healthcare industry; and

•

efforts by governments, insurance companies and others to contain healthcare costs, including changes to reimbursement policies.

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical results are not necessarily meaningful, and
investors should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance. To the extent we experience the factors described above, our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time,
which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.



We may undergo an “ownership change” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which would limit
our ability to utilize net operating losses from prior tax years.

If we undergo an “ownership change” for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards from prior years to reduce taxable income in future tax years might be limited by operation of the Internal Revenue Code, either by limiting the amount of net
operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in a given year, or in total over the entire carry-forward period. Certain changes in the ownership of our common stock may result in an ownership change sufficient to limit the
availability of our net operating losses. We also have net operating loss carry-forwards in other countries outside of the U.S. and our ability to use those losses in the future to offset taxable income could be limited by tax regulations in those
countries.

We may not have sufficient funds to develop and commercialize our new products or make acquisitions of desirable companies,
products or technologies.

The development, manufacture and sale of any medical device is very expensive and we may
require additional funds to make acquisitions of desirable companies, products or technologies. We cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products or acquire companies, products, or technologies, or
that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to support these efforts, our business may be adversely affected. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to
finance our operations for the next fiscal year. We also may evaluate from time to time other financing alternatives as necessary to fund operations, and any equity or convertible debt financing may involve substantial dilution to our existing
stockholders.

We own patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property and know-how that we believe gives
us a competitive advantage. If we cannot protect our intellectual property and develop or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property, competition could force us to lower our prices, which could hurt our profitability.

Our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success. A substantial portion of our
intellectual property rights relating to the Impella products and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets, rather than patents. Unlike patents, trade secrets are only recognized under applicable law if they are kept secret
by restricting their disclosure to third parties. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. However, certain consultants and third parties with
whom we have business relationships, and to whom in some cases we have disclosed trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge, may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry, including companies, universities and research
organizations that are developing competing products. In addition, some of our former employees who were exposed to certain of our trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge in the course of their employment may seek employment with, and become
employed by, our competitors. We cannot be assured that consultants, employees and other third parties with whom we have entered into confidentiality agreements will not breach the terms of such agreements by improperly using or disclosing our trade
secrets or other proprietary knowledge, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors. The loss of trade secret protection for
technologies or know-how relating to our product portfolio and products under development could adversely affect our business and our prospects.

Our business position also depends in part on our ability to maintain and defend our existing patents and obtain, maintain, and defend additional patents and other intellectual property rights. We intend
to seek additional patents, but our pending and future patent applications may not be approved, may not give us a competitive advantage, could be challenged by others, or if issued, could be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Patent prosecution,
related proceedings, and litigation in the U.S. and in other countries may be expensive, time consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. In addition, patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under U.S. patent law
and may not adequately protect our proprietary information. Our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours or design around our patents. The expiration of
patents on which we rely for protection of key products could diminish our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business and our prospects.

Companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of
others. If a third-party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us, we may be liable for substantial damages, be unable to sell products using that technology, or have to seek a license or redesign the related product. These
alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible. Intellectual property litigation could be costly, result in product development delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business.

Product liability claims could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial results.

The clinical use of medical products, even after regulatory approval, poses an inherent risk of product liability claims. We maintain
limited product liability insurance coverage, subject to certain deductibles and exclusions. We cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs, or that
such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business.
As we continue to introduce more products, we face an increased risk that a product liability claim will be brought against us.



Some of our products are designed for patients who suffer from late-stage or end-stage heart
failure, and many of these patients do not survive, even when supported by our products. There are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death, including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product, the skill and
reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product and product maintenance by customers. However, the failure of the products we distribute for clinical testing or sale could give rise to product liability claims and
negative publicity.

The risk of product liability claims is heightened when we sell products that are intended to support a
patient until the end of life. The finite life of our products, as well as complications associated with their use, could give rise to product liability claims whether or not the products have extended or improved the quality of a patient’s
life. If we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage, our financial condition will be adversely affected.

Quality problems can result in substantial costs and inventory write-downs.

Government regulations require us to track materials used in the manufacture of our products, so that if a problem is identified in one
product it can be traced to other products that may have the same problem. An identified quality problem may require reworking or scrapping related inventory and recalling previous shipments. Because a malfunction in our products can be
life-threatening, we may be required to recall and replace, free of charge, products already in the marketplace. Any quality problem could cause us to incur significant expenses, lead to significant write-offs, injure our reputation and harm our
business and financial results.

Disruptions of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could
harm our business, customer relations and financial condition.

We rely in part on information technology to store
information, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy, secure our data and accurately produce our financial statements. If our information technology systems do not effectively and securely collect, store, process and report relevant
data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and
regulations would be materially impaired. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the timeliness with which we report our operating results.

Our business requires us to use and store customer, vendor, employee and business partner and, in certain instances patient, personally
identifiable information. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA, which mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of
information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such
information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to criminal
penalties and civil sanctions.

While we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security
measures to protect our systems and data, including our own proprietary information and the confidential and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, business partners and patients, these measures cannot provide absolute
security. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful,
resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a
computer security breach or cyber-attack affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged and our operations could be impaired. We would also
be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we acquire other companies or businesses, we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business.

We may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses, products or technologies. Any such acquisition may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipate and an
acquired business, product or technology might not perform as we expect. Our management could spend a significant amount of time, effort and money in identifying, pursuing and completing the acquisition. If we complete an acquisition, we may
encounter significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company into our operations. In particular, we may lose the services of key employees of the acquired company and we may
make changes in management that impair the acquired company’s relationships with employees, vendors and customers. Additionally, we may acquire development-stage companies that are not yet profitable and which require continued investment,
which could decrease our future earnings.

Any of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of
an acquisition. To pay for an acquisition, we might use stock or cash. Alternatively, we might borrow money from a bank or other lender. If we use stock, our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests. If we use cash or debt
financing, our financial liquidity would be reduced.



If we include future milestones as part of the potential purchase price of an acquisition,
as we did in connection with our 2014 acquisition of ECP, then we will have to estimate the value of these milestones each reporting period and any changes underlying these estimates with respect to expected timing or valuation of these milestones
could have a volatile impact on our earnings.

Revisions to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance
requirements could result in changes to our standard practices and could require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources, especially by senior management.

We must follow accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws set by the governing
bodies and lawmakers in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions where we do business, as well as NASDAQ. From time to time, these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws. These new and revised accounting standards and
financial reporting and corporate governance requirements may require changes to our financial statements, the composition of our Board of Directors, the responsibility and manner of operation of various board level committees and the information
filed by us with the governing bodies. Our accounting practices that may be affected by changes in the accounting principles are as follows:

•

accounting for revenue recognition;

•

accounting for intangibles—goodwill and other;

•

fair value measurement;

•

accounting for income taxes;

•

accounting for stock-based compensation;

•

accounting for leases; and

•

accounting for business combinations.

Implementing changes required by new standards, requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources. It is impossible to completely predict the impact, if
any, on us of future changes to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements.

We use estimates,
make judgments and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies. As these estimates, judgments and methods change, our assessment of the progress of our
business and our results of operations could vary.

The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our
accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, complexities, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that
may lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may cause variation in our reporting and may adversely affect our reported financial results.

Environmental and health safety laws may result in liabilities, expenses and restrictions on our operations.

Federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding environmental protection, hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business. Using hazardous substances in our operations
exposes us to the risk of accidental injury, contamination or other liability from the use, storage, importation, handling, or disposal of hazardous materials. If our or our suppliers’ operations result in the contamination of the environment
or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and fines, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We maintain insurance for
certain environmental risks, subject to substantial deductibles; however, we cannot assure you we can continue to maintain this insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or at all. Future changes to environmental and health and safety laws could
cause us to incur additional expenses or restrict our operations.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in
declines in our reported sales and results of operations.

Because some of our international sales are denominated in
local currencies and not in U.S. dollars, our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro. At present, we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. As a result,
sales and expenses occurring in the future that are denominated in foreign currencies may be translated into U.S. dollars at less favorable rates, resulting in reduced revenues and earnings.



Risks Related to Our Common Stock

The market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price
of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so. For example, from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015, the price of our stock ranged from a low of $20.29 per share to a high of $74.70 per share. Many factors could cause
the market price of our common stock to rise and fall. Some of these factors are:

•

variations in our quarterly results of operations;

•

status of regulatory approvals for our products;

•

introduction of new products by us or our competitors;

•

acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors;

•

changes in healthcare policy or third-party reimbursement practices;

•

changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;

•

the hiring or departure of key personnel;

•

results of clinical trials of our products;

•

future sales of shares of common stock in the public market;

•

the outcome of currently pending litigation and governmental investigations

;

and

•

market conditions in the industry, particularly around reimbursement for our products and the economy as a whole.

In addition, the stock market in general and the market for shares of medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market
price of a company’s stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our
management and other resources, or otherwise harm our business.

The sale of additional shares of our common stock, or the exercise of
outstanding options to purchase our common stock, would dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest.

We have
issued a substantial number of options to acquire our common stock and we expect to continue to issue options to our employees and others. If all outstanding stock options were exercised, our stockholders would suffer dilution of their ownership
interest. In addition, we have issued from time to time, additional shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, public offerings, and other activities. Future issuances of our common stock would also result in a dilution of our
stockholders’ ownership interest.

The sale of material amounts of common stock could encourage short sales by third parties and
depress the price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.

The
downward pressure on our stock price caused by the sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur by any of our significant stockholders could cause our stock price to decline, thus allowing
short sellers of our stock an opportunity to take advantage of any decrease in the value of our stock. The presence of short sellers in our common stock may further depress the price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders
from realizing a premium on our stock.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware General
Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock. Those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and
Delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our Board of Directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, such provisions may also
discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could negatively affect our stock price.

The market
value of our common stock could vary significantly based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts.

The perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price. As a result, the market price of our common stock has and could in the future
change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements. Many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control.



We have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends and any return on our stockholders’
investment will likely be limited to the value of our common stock.

We have never paid dividends on our common stock
and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as
our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on our stockholders’ investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.

Overview

We are a leading provider of temporary percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients. We develop, manufacture and market proprietary
products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily performing the pumping function of the heart. Our products are used in the cath lab by
interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons. A physician may use our devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support before, during or after angioplasty or
heart surgery procedures. We believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for patients experiencing heart failure because it enables patients to go home with their own native heart and restores their quality of life. In addition, we
believe that for the care of such patients, heart recovery is the most cost-effective solution for the healthcare system.

Our
strategic focus and the driver of the majority of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our Impella family of products. Our Impella 2.5 product received 510(k) clearance in June 2008 from the FDA for partial circulatory support for up to
six hours. In March 2015, we received PMA from the FDA for Impella 2.5 during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures. Impella 2.5 is the first hemodynamic support device to receive a PMA indication for use during high-risk PCI procedures,
demonstrating its safety and effectiveness for this complex patient population. With this approval, the Impella 2.5 is a temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent
hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the
Impella 2.5 in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce peri- and post-procedural adverse events. The product labeling allows for the clinical decision to leave
Impella 2.5 in place beyond the intended duration of

£

6 hours due to unforeseen circumstances. Per our PMA approval, we will conduct a single-arm, post approval study on the Impella 2.5, collecting data
on high-risk PCI patients. The study will be a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from 70 sites supported with the Impella 2.5 system. The Impella 2.5 heart pump is supported by clinical guidelines, has been eligible to be
reimbursed in the U.S. by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS under ICD-9-CM code 37.68 since 2008 for multiple indications, including high-risk PCI.

We received 510(k) clearance in April 2009 for our Impella 5.0 and Impella LD devices for circulatory support for up to six hours. These devices are larger and provide more blood flow to patients than the
Impella 2.5. In September 2012, our Impella CP product received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for partial circulatory support for up to six hours. The Impella CP and Impella 5.0 will be submitted in the future as PMA supplements and will retain
their 510(k) clearances until completion of the FDA process. We received FDA approval for Impella RP under an HDE in January 2015. The Impella RP is the first percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA
approval. Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP products also have CE Mark approval and Health Canada approval which allows us to market these devices in the European Union and Canada.

The Impella product portfolio, which includes the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella RP, Impella LD and Impella 5.0, has supported over
25,000 patients in the U.S.

In July 2014, we acquired all of the issued shares of ECP, a German limited liability company,
for $13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payments up to a maximum of $15.0 million based on the achievement of certain technical, regulatory and commercial milestones. ECP, based in Berlin, Germany, is engaged in research, development,
prototyping and the pre-serial production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft. In connection with our acquisition of ECP, ECP acquired all of the issued shares of
AIS, a German limited liability company, for $2.8 million in cash which was provided by us. AIS, based in Aachen, Germany, holds certain intellectual property useful to ECP’s business, and, prior to being acquired by ECP, had licensed such
intellectual property to ECP.

Our revenues are primarily generated from our Impella line of products. Revenues from our
non-Impella products, largely focused on the heart surgery suite, have been lower over the past several years as we have strategically shifted our sales and marketing efforts towards our Impella products and the cath lab. We expect that most of our
product and service revenues in the near future will be from our Impella products.



Summary of Recent Financial Performance

During fiscal 2015, we recognized net income of $113.7 million, or $2.80 per basic share and $2.65 per diluted share, compared to $7.4
million, or $0.19 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. Our net income for the year ended March 31, 2015 included an income tax benefit of $84.9 million, primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance
on certain of our deferred tax assets in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We also had higher Impella product revenue due to greater utilization of our Impella products in the U.S. and Europe in fiscal 2015.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The accounting policies we believe are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition, in-process research
and development, contingent consideration and income taxes. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described under the heading “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements
contained elsewhere herein.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed (generally upon shipment) or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable
and collectability is reasonably assured.

Revenue from product sales to customers is recognized when delivery has
occurred. All costs related to product sales are recognized at time of delivery. We do not provide for rights of return to customers on our product sales and therefore we do not record a provision for returns.

Maintenance and service support contract revenues are included in product revenue and are recognized ratably over the term of the service
contracts. Revenue is recognized as it is earned in limited instances where we rent console medical devices to customers on a month-to-month basis or for a longer specified period of time. Other service revenues are recognized as the services are
performed.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development, or IPR&D, assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. IPR&D assets
represent the fair value assigned to technologies that we acquire, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. During the period that the assets are considered indefinite-lived,
they are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IPR&D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when
development is complete, which generally occurs when we have regulatory approval and are able to commercialize products associated with the IPR&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated
useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, we may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR&D assets over fair value.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration is recorded as a liability and measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the probability of achieving each of
the potential milestones and an estimated discount rate associated with the risks of the expected cash flows attributable to the various milestones. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected
timelines for achievement of any of these milestones would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of these milestones, respectively, and commensurate changes to the associated liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration
at each reporting date will be updated by reflecting the changes in fair value reflected in our statement of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in the estimates of
earn out results. We have a liability of $6.5 million of contingent consideration related to $15.0 million in potential payments as of March 31, 2015, related to the ECP acquisition.

Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and
a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to
temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.



We regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Assessing the
realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. We consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on our deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred
tax assets. Prior to March 31, 2015, we had determined that the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence due to our history of net operating losses incurred for most of our existence, the then-pending status of
our PMA application with the FDA for our Impella 2.5 product, the uncertainties relative to the DOJ investigations, among other factors, and as a result we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. During the quarter ended
March 31, 2015, we determined based on our consideration of the weight of positive and negative evidence that there was sufficient positive evidence that most of our federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than
not recoverable as of March 31, 2015. Our conclusion was primarily driven by the receipt of PMA approval for our Impella 2.5 product in March 2015, the $28.8 million of income before taxes in fiscal 2015, our history of profits in recent years
and our expectation of sustainable future profitability now that we have obtained PMA approval for Impella 2.5. Accordingly, we recorded a $101.5 million reversal of the valuation allowance during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, primarily
related to the Company expecting to be able to use NOL carryforwards in the future in the U.S. and Germany.

As of
March 31, 2015, the remaining $2.9 million valuation allowance represents deferred tax assets related to NOL carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions. Based on the review of all available evidence, we recorded a valuation allowance to
reduce these deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realizable as of March 31, 2015.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2. “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements in this Report.

Results of Operations



The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the
periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues:

Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 (“fiscal
2015” and “fiscal 2014”)

Revenue

Our revenues are comprised of the following:

Impella product revenue encompasses Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD and Impella RP
product sales. Other product revenue includes AB5000, BVS5000 and product accessory revenue. Service and other revenue represents revenue earned on service maintenance contracts and preventive maintenance calls.

Total revenues for fiscal 2015 increased by $46.7 million, or 25%, to $230.3 million from $183.6 million for fiscal 2014. The increase in
total revenue was primarily due to higher Impella revenue due mainly to greater utilization of our products in the U.S.

Impella product revenues for fiscal 2015 increased by $45.7 million, or 27%, to $212.7 million from $167.0 million for fiscal 2014. Most
of our increase in Impella revenue was from disposable catheter sales in the U.S., as we focus on increasing utilization of our disposable catheter products through continued investment in our field organization and physician training programs.
Impella product revenues outside the US increased by $6.2 million, or 41%, during fiscal 2015. Most of this increase was due to Impella product sales in Europe, primarily Germany, as we continue to expand our commercial infrastructure there. We
expect Impella revenues to continue to increase with our recent PMA approval in the U.S. and as we add new customer sites, increase utilization at existing customer sites, continue our commercial launch of Impella CP, begin our introduction of
Impella RP to the market and expand our efforts in Europe.

Service and other revenue for fiscal 2015 increased by $2.9
million, or 27%, to $13.8 million from $10.9 million for fiscal 2014. The increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in preventative maintenance service contracts, as we expand the use of our Impella AIC consoles to additional
sites.

Other product revenues for fiscal 2015 decreased by $1.9 million, or 35%, to $3.5 million from $5.4 million for fiscal
2014. The decrease in other revenue was due to a decline in AB5000 disposable sales. We also had no sales of BVS 5000 in fiscal 2015 and we are no longer actively producing that product. We also expect that AB5000 revenue will continue to decline in
fiscal 2016 as we focus our sales efforts in the surgical suite on Impella 5.0 and LD.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Product Revenue

Cost of product revenue for fiscal 2015 increased by $2.6 million, or 7%, to $39.9 million from $37.3 million for fiscal 2014. Gross
margin was 83% for fiscal 2015 and 80% for fiscal 2014. The increase in cost of product revenues was related to increased Impella demand and higher production volume and costs to support growing demand for our Impella products. Gross margin was
impacted favorably by higher manufacturing production volume, fewer shipments of AIC consoles, improved efficiencies in manufacturing production and a favorable Euro in the second half of fiscal 2015.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2015 increased by $5.3 million, or 17%, to $36.0 million from $30.7 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due
to operating expenses associated with the ECP business in Berlin



that we acquired in July 2014 and a $1.5 million up-front license payment made to Opsens, Inc. in April 2014 for optical sensor technology. We expect research and development expenses to increase
in fiscal 2016 as we continue to pursue our PMA supplements for Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD products in the U.S., incur clinical spending related to our U.S. Impella registry, and apply for regulatory approval for our Impella products in
Japan. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs as we continue to focus on product development initiatives associated with existing products and new technologies.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 increased by $18.4 million, or 17%, to $125.7 million from $107.3 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the hiring of additional U.S. field
sales and clinical personnel, increased spending on marketing initiatives as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of hemodynamic support, higher stock-based compensation expense, higher excise taxes associated with the medical device
tax in the U.S. and legal and professional expenses related to the ECP acquisition. These amounts were partially offset by lower legal expenses related to the DOJ Investigations and shareholder suit discussed in “Note 12. Commitments and
Contingencies—Litigation,” in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

We expect to continue to increase our
expenditures on sales and marketing activities, with particular investments in field sales and clinical personnel with cath lab expertise to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients. We also plan to increase our marketing, service
and training investments after PMA approval in the U.S. for Impella 2.5. For the foreseeable future, we also expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses related to the DOJ Investigations, each discussed in “Note 12. Commitments and
Contingencies—Litigation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Income Tax Provision

We recorded an income tax benefit of $84.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to an income tax expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2014. The
income tax benefit in fiscal 2015 was comprised of an $87.1 million deferred tax benefit primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, partially offset by a
current income tax provision of $2.2 million in U.S and Germany. The income tax provision for fiscal 2014 was comprised of income taxes in Germany and income taxes related to the deferred tax liability associated with tax deductible goodwill.

Net Income

During fiscal 2015, we recognized net income of $113.7 million, or $2.80 per basic share and $2.65 per diluted share, compared to $7.4
million, or $0.19 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. Our net income for the year ended March 31, 2015 included an income tax benefit of $84.9 million, primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance
on certain of our deferred tax assets in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 was also due to higher Impella product revenue in the U.S. and Europe.

Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 (“fiscal 2014” and “fiscal 2013”)

Revenue

Our revenues
are comprised of the following:

Impella product revenue encompasses Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, and Impella LD product sales.
Other product revenue includes AB5000, BVS5000 and product accessory sales. Service and other revenue represents revenue earned on service maintenance contracts and preventive maintenance calls.



Total revenues for fiscal 2014 increased by $25.5 million, or 16%, to $183.6 million from
$158.1 million for fiscal 2013. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to higher Impella revenue due to greater utilization in the U.S., which was primarily attributable to the introduction of Impella CP in the second half of fiscal 2013.

Impella product revenues for fiscal 2014 increased by $26.7 million, or 19%, to $167.0 million from $140.3 million for fiscal
2013. Most of our increase in Impella revenue was from disposable catheter sales in the U.S., as we focus on increasing utilization of our disposable catheter products through continued investment in our field organization and physician training
programs. Also, contributing to the sales increase was the introduction of Impella CP to 389 sites in the U.S. since 510(k) clearance was obtained in fiscal 2013. Impella product revenues outside the US increased by $6.0 million, or 67%, during
fiscal 2014. Most of this increase was due to Impella product sales in Europe, primarily Germany, as we expanded our commercial infrastructure there.

Service and other revenue for fiscal 2014 increased by $1.7 million, or 18%, to $10.9 million from $9.2 million for fiscal 2013. The increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in
preventative maintenance service contracts, as we expand the use of our Impella AIC consoles to additional sites.

Other
product revenues for fiscal 2014 decreased by $2.7 million, or 33%, to $5.4 million from $8.1 million for fiscal 2013. The decrease in other revenue was due to a decline in BVS 5000 and AB5000 disposable sales. We are no longer actively producing
the BVS 5000 and currently only actively selling the BVS 5000 upon request. We also expect that AB5000 revenue will continue to decline in fiscal 2015 as we focus our sales efforts in the surgical suite on Impella 5.0 and LD.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Product
Revenue

Cost of product revenue for fiscal 2014 increased by $5.7 million, or 18%, to $37.3 million from $31.6 million
for fiscal 2013. Gross margin for each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 was 80%. The increase in cost of product revenues was related to increased Impella demand and higher production volume and costs to support the higher demand for Impella products.
Gross margin rates remained stable in fiscal 2014 as we maintained average selling price for Impella products in the U.S., improved manufacturing yields and product cost savings from suppliers on increased volume. These improvements were offset by
increased shipments of AIC consoles and higher costs for product testing and inspection.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2014 increased by $5.1 million, or 20%, to $30.7 million from $25.6 million in fiscal 2013.
The increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an increase in spending associated with our PMA application for our existing Impella products, increased headcount in quality control, clinical spending related to our U.S.
Impella registry and our Impella RP IDE study and product development initiatives associated with Impella RP and Impella CP.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 increased by $23.1
million, or 27%, to $107.3 million from $84.2 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the hiring of additional U.S. field sales and clinical personnel, increased spending on marketing
initiatives as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of hemodynamic support, implementation of the medical device tax and higher legal expenses related to the Department of Justice investigation and shareholder suits as well as expanded
compliance functions. During the year ended March 31, 2014, we incurred legal expenses of approximately $6.2 million in connection with complying with the subpoena received from the Department of Justice in October 2012 and defense of other
legal claims. We also incurred $2.7 million of expenses in the year ended March 31, 2014 as a result of the medical device tax, which was implemented in the U.S. in January 2013.

Income Tax Provision

During fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recorded a provision
for income taxes of $1.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The income tax provision for fiscal 2014 is comprised of $0.5 million of income taxes in Germany and $0.8 million for income taxes related to the deferred tax liability relating to tax
deductible goodwill. These amounts are offset by $0.1 million reduction in federal and state income taxes due to change in estimate of alternative minimum tax in the U.S.

Net Income

During fiscal 2014, we recognized net income of $7.4 million,
or $0.19 per basic share and $0.18 per diluted share compared to net income of $15.0 million, or $0.38 per basic share and $0.37 per diluted share, for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in net income in fiscal



2014 was driven by higher operating expenses from expanding our commercial infrastructure, additional research and development costs, the implementation of the medical device tax in the U.S. in
January 2013, and additional legal fees to comply with the subpoena received from the Department of Justice in October 2012 and defend ourselves from other legal claims, which were partially offset by increased Impella sales resulting from greater
demand for our products, particularly the Impella CP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At March 31, 2015, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short and long-term marketable securities totaled $146.0 million, an
increase of $27.7 million compared to $118.3 million at March 31, 2014. The increase in our cash, cash equivalents, and short and long-term marketable securities was due primarily to positive cash flows from operations in fiscal 2015 and
proceeds from stock option exercises, partially offset by the ECP and AIS acquisitions discussed above in “Overview.” We paid approximately $15.7 million in net cash for the initial purchase price of these acquisitions. We also could be
required to pay up to an additional $15.0 million, which may be paid, at our discretion, as cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both, in connection with the acquisition of ECP, if certain technical, regulatory and commercial
milestones are met.

Following is a summary of our cash flow activities:

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

For the year ended March 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $113.7 million, less non-cash
items of $65.7 million and cash used for working capital of $4.7 million. The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 included a deferred income tax benefit of $87.1 million primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance on certain of our
deferred tax assets and higher Impella product revenue due to greater utilization in the U.S. and Europe. Other non-cash items primarily consisted of $16.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.8 million of depreciation and amortization of
long-lived assets, $2.2 million of write-downs of inventory and a $0.5 million change in fair value of contingent consideration. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital included an $8.0 million increase in accounts receivable from
higher revenues, a $7.0 million increase in inventory to support growing demand for our Impella products, and a $1.5 million increase in prepaid expenses. These amounts were partially offset by $9.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued
expenses due to increase in operating expenses as discussed above in “Costs and Expenses” and an increase in deferred revenue of $2.3 million primarily due to an increase in preventative maintenance service contracts as we expand the use
of our Impella AIC consoles to additional sites.

For the year ended March 31, 2014, cash provided by operating
activities consisted of net income of $7.4 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $16.6 million and cash used for working capital of $0.5 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $11.2 million of stock-based compensation
expense, $2.5 million of depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, $2.0 million of write-downs of inventory and a $0.9 million change in deferred tax provision. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a
$2.4 million increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses mostly related to timing of vendor payments.

For the year ended March 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $15.0 million, adjustments for
non-cash items of $14.2 million and cash used in working capital of $2.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $9.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.7 million of depreciation and amortization of long-lived
assets, $1.2 million of write-downs of inventory and a $0.8 million change in deferred tax provision. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses, a
$5.3 million increase in inventory and a $1.2 million increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses mostly related to timing of vendor payments.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

For the year ended March 31, 2015, net cash used for investing activities included $26.1 million for the purchase (net of maturities) of marketable securities, $15.7 million for our acquisition of
ECP and AIS, $5.2 million for the purchase of property and equipment mostly related to expansion of manufacturing capacity in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany and $2.9 million of investments in private medical technology companies.



For the year ended March 31, 2014, net cash used for investing activities included
$18.8 million for the purchase (net of maturities) of marketable securities, $2.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment mostly related to leasehold improvements in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany and $0.8 million of
investments in private medical technology companies.

For the year ended March 31, 2013, net cash used for investing
activities included $7.4 million for the purchase (net of maturities) of marketable securities and $2.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment mostly related to leasehold improvements in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are estimated to range from $15.0 to $20.0 million, and are expected to be for
manufacturing capacity expansions in both our Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany facilities, leasehold improvements and software development projects.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

For the year ended
March 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities included $10.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, $0.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and $0.6 million in
excess tax benefits on stock-based awards. These amounts were partially offset by $2.8 million in payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for payroll withholding taxes upon vesting of certain equity awards.

For the year ended March 31, 2014, net cash provided by financing activities included $9.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of
stock options and $0.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan. These amounts were partially offset by $0.4 million in payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for payroll withholding taxes upon
vesting of certain equity awards.

For the year ended March 31, 2013, net cash used for financing activities included
$15.0 million in cash used for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program and $0.3 million in payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for payroll withholding taxes upon vesting of certain equity awards. These amounts were
partially offset by $2.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $0.6 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

Operating Capital and Liquidity Requirements

We believe that our
revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment
our existing line of products.

Our primary liquidity requirements are to fund the expansion of our commercial infrastructure
in the U.S., increase our Impella manufacturing capacity, expand our office space in Danvers, Massachusetts and Aachen, Germany, increase our inventory levels in order to meet increasing customer demand for our Impella products, fund new product
development, prepare for commercial launches of Impella in new markets in the future, such as Japan, costs of legal fees related to the DOJ Investigations and to provide for general working capital needs. Through March 31, 2015, we have funded
our operations principally from product sales and through the sale of equity securities.

Our liquidity is influenced by our
ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers’ ability to pay for our products. Factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products, maintain or reduce the length of the
selling cycle for our products, capital expenditure requirements, invest in collaborative arrangements with other partners, and collect cash from customers after our products are sold. We also expect to continue to incur legal expenses for the
foreseeable future related to the DOJ Investigations and our response to requests for information. We continue to review our long-term cash needs on a regular basis. At March 31, 2015, we had no long-term debt outstanding.

Marketable securities at March 31, 2015 consisted of $123.6 million held in funds that invest in U.S. Treasury and government-backed
securities. We are not a party to any interest rate swaps, currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets.

Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $3.6 million and $3.3 million at March 31, 2015 and
March 31, 2014, respectively. Our operating income outside the U.S. is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. We do not intend or currently foresee a need to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign
subsidiaries. If these funds are needed in the U.S., we believe that the potential U.S. tax impact to repatriate these funds would be immaterial.



Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2015 and the effects such obligations are expected to have
on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

(1)

Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and expected liabilities under agreements with third parties, primarily for research and development
activities, such as clinical trials and material purchases for new product testing.

On July 1, 2014, we
acquired ECP for $13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payouts totaling $15.0 million based on the achievement of certain technical, regulatory and commercial milestones. These milestone payments may be made, at our option, by a
combination of cash or our common stock. The above table does not reflect these milestone payments, which may be payable over the next 20 years as the timing and amount of the milestone payments are indeterminate at this time. The maximum amount of
the aggregate milestone payments could be $15.0 million. As of March 31, 2015, the fair value of the contingent payments was approximately $6.5 million and is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.

We had no long-term debt, capital leases or other material commitments at March 31, 2015 other than those shown in the table above.

Our headquarters is located at 22 Cherry Hill Drive in Danvers, Massachusetts and consisted of approximately 96,000 square
feet of space under an operating lease as of March 31, 2015. On April 30, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the lease in which we agreed to lease an additional 24,560 square feet of space. In addition, we have certain rights to
terminate the lease early, subject to the payment of a specified termination fee based on the timing of the termination, as further outlined in the lease amendment. The amendment also grants us a one-time right of first offer to lease new space in
the facility and a one-time first right of refusal to buy the facility, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. This facility encompasses most of our U.S. operations, including research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing
and general and administrative departments. The monthly lease payments over the term of the lease are as follows:

•

The base rent for May 2014 through December 2015 is $74,050 per month; and

•

The base rent for January 2016 through February 2016 will be $85,818 per month; and

•

The base rent for March 2016 through February 2018 will be $82,518 per month; and

•

The base rent for March 2018 through February 2021 will be $85,030 per month.

Our European headquarters is located in Aachen, Germany and consists of approximately 33,000 square feet of space under an operating
lease. In July 2013, we entered into a lease agreement to continue renting our existing space in Aachen, Germany through July 31, 2023. The lease payments are approximately 34,500€ (euro) (approximately U.S. $37,400 at March 31, 2015
exchange rates) per month. The building houses most of the manufacturing operations for our Impella product line as well as certain research and development functions and the sales, marketing and general and administrative functions for most of our
product lines sold in Europe and the Middle East.

We are also party to a license agreement related to certain circulatory
care device patents and know-how. Under this agreement, we would be obligated to pay up to $3.0 million in cash or stock, if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved. The amount has not been included in the contractual
obligations table above due to the uncertainty related to the successful achievement of these milestones.

In April 2014, we
entered into an exclusive license agreement with Opsens, Inc. for the rights to certain optical sensor technologies in the field of cardio-circulatory assist devices. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made a $1.5 million upfront
payment upon execution of the agreement and agreed to make additional payments of up to $4.5 million upon achievement of specified development milestones. The future milestone payment amounts have not been included in the contractual obligations
table above due to the uncertainty related to the successful achievement of these milestones.

We apply the disclosure
provisions of

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,

to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses. These disclosure provisions require
that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote. The following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor.



We enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, typically
with underwriters, contractors, clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions. Under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a
result of our activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited.
We have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these
agreements at March 31, 2015.

In our clinical study agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the participating
institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement, the protocol for the device
and our instructions. The indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims. We have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions
contained in our clinical study agreements.

In many sales transactions, we indemnify customers against possible claims of
patent infringement caused by our products. The indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims. We have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related
to sales transactions.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Primary Market Risk Exposures

Our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. Marketable securities at March 31, 2015 consisted of $123.6 million held in funds that invest in U.S. Treasury and
government-backed securities. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10 percent from levels at March 31, 2015, we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial.

Currency Exchange Rates

We have foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and particularly with respect to the euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen. Therefore, our investment in our subsidiaries is
sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’
equity. If rates of exchange for the euro, British pound and Japanese yen were to have depreciated immediately and uniformly by 10% relative to the U.S. dollar from levels at March 31, 2015, the result would have been a reduction of
stockholders’ equity of approximately $4.2 million.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses. The estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. Considerable judgment is required, however, to
interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions
and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management,
with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of March 31, 2015. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2015, these disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment under the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2015.

Important Considerations

Our internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that
audited our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2015, included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report is set forth below:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

ABIOMED, Inc.

Danvers, Massachusetts

We have audited the
internal control over financial reporting of ABIOMED, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2015 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated May 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

ABIOMED, Inc.

Danvers, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ABIOMED, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ABIOMED, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated May 28, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1. Nature of Operations

Abiomed, Inc. (the “Company” or “Abiomed”) is a leading provider of mechanical circulatory support devices and
offers a continuum of care in heart recovery to heart failure patients. The Company develops, manufactures and markets proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow and/or performing the
pumping function of the heart. The Company’s products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab, or cath lab, by interventional cardiologists and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support
before, during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies described below.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of receivables, realizability of inventory, goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, accrued expenses,
stock-based compensation, income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities, contingencies and litigation. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be
subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash
Equivalents and Marketable Securities

The Company classifies any marketable security with a maturity date of 90 days or less at the time
of purchase as a cash equivalent. Cash equivalents are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value.

The Company classifies any security
with a maturity date of greater than 90 days at the time of purchase as marketable securities and classifies marketable securities with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date as long-term marketable securities.
Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity securities. If the Company does not have the intent and ability to hold a security to maturity, it
reports the investment as available-for-sale securities. The Company reports available-for-sale securities at fair value, and includes unrealized gains and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized losses in stockholders’ equity. If any
adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is “other than temporary” and, if so, marks the security to market through a charge to
unrealized loss on short-term marketable securities in the consolidated statements of operations.

Major Customers and Concentrations of
Credit Risk

The Company primarily sells its products to hospitals and distributors. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total
product revenues in fiscal year 2015, 2014 or 2013. No customer had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at March 31, 2015 and 2014.

Credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and generally collateral is not required. To date, credit losses have not been significant and the Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Receivables are geographically dispersed, primarily throughout the U.S., as well as in Europe and other foreign countries where formal distributor
agreements exist.

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of
cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. Management mitigates credit risk by limiting the investment type and maturity to securities that preserve capital, maintain liquidity and have a high credit
quality.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts of which
approximate fair market value as they are highly liquid and primarily short term in nature.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is based on the first in, first out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory
quantities on hand and writes down to its net realizable value any inventory that it believes to be impaired. Management considers forecast demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and
product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.

Property and Equipment

Property and
equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of three to five years for machinery and equipment, computer software, and furniture and fixtures.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other
disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.

Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized based on
the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved and other valuation techniques.

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, instead the Company evaluates goodwill for
impairment at least annually at October 31, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Goodwill impairment assessments are performed at the reporting unit level. The goodwill test involves a two-step process. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit’s fair value to its
carrying value. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring
a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
value (“Step 0”). Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political
developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies and overall financial performance. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
unit is less than its carry amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary.

When necessary, the goodwill impairment test
is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of its single reporting unit using a

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal values
for the reporting unit is discounted to a present value using an appropriate discount rate. Cash flow projections are based on management’s estimates of economic and market conditions which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates,
operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The discount rate is based on the specific risk characteristics of the reporting unit and its underlying forecast. The market approach estimates fair value by comparing
publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The fair values determined by the market approach and income approach, are weighted to determine the fair value for the reporting unit based
primarily on the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting unit to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit’s
fair value, the Company also compares the reporting unit’s fair value to its market capitalization (per share stock price times number of common shares outstanding) and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the reporting
unit’s fair value over the market capitalization).

If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then a second
step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, by comparing the fair value of each identifiable asset and liability in the reporting unit to the total fair value of the reporting unit. Any impairment loss is expensed in the
consolidated statement of operations and is not reversed if the fair value subsequently increases.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development, or IPR&D, assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of
the associated research and development projects. IPR&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that are acquired, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use.
During the period that the IPR&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that
the fair value of the IPR&D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and are able to commercialize products associated with the IPR&D assets, these
assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR&D assets,
calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR&D assets over fair value.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration is recorded as a liability and is the estimate of the fair value of potential milestone payments related to business
acquisitions. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the probability of achieving each of the potential milestones and an estimated discount rate
associated with the risks of the expected cash flows attributable to the various milestones. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones would
result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of these milestones, respectively, and commensurate changes to the associated liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting date is updated by reflecting the changes
in fair value reflected within research and development expenses in our statement of operations.

Accrued Expenses

As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying
services that third parties have performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include
contract service fees, such as amounts due to clinical research organizations, investigators in conjunction with clinical trials, professional service fees, such as attorneys and accountants, and third party expenses relating to marketing efforts
associated with commercialization of the Company’s product and product candidates. Accrued expenses also include estimates for payroll costs, such as bonuses and commissions. In the event that the Company does not identify certain costs that
have been incurred or it under or over-estimates the level of services or the costs of such services, reported expenses for a reporting period could be overstated or understated. The date in which certain services commence, the level of
services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to the Company’s judgment. The Company makes these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

The Company
recognizes revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed (generally upon shipment) or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.

F-10


ABIOMED, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Revenue from product sales to customers is recognized when delivery has occurred. All costs related to
product sales are recognized at time of delivery. The Company does not provide for rights of return to customers on product sales and therefore does not record a provision for returns.

Maintenance and service support contract revenues are included in product sales and are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts. Revenue is recognized as earned in limited instances
where the Company rents its console medical devices on a month-to-month basis or for a longer specified period of time to customers.

Government-sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. Revenues from these
contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed, provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work. Under contracts in which the Company elects to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of
the contract than the total contract amount, the Company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred.

Product Warranty

The Company generally
provides a one-year warranty for certain products sold in which estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense at the time of shipment and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
Company’s products are subject to regulatory and quality standards. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical product performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product
warranty involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

The
functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The cumulative translation effect for subsidiaries using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is included in accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s intercompany accounts are denominated
in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany receivables that the Company considers to be of a long-term investment nature are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, while gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany receivables from those foreign subsidiaries for which the Company
anticipates settlement in the foreseeable future are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The net gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were not
significant.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the
treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted average shares outstanding any potential
dilutive securities outstanding for the fiscal year. Potential dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance-based awards and shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan. In
fiscal years when a net loss is reported, all common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation because they would have an anti-dilutive effect, meaning the loss per share would be reduced. Therefore, in periods when a loss is reported
basic and dilutive loss per share are the same.

F-11


ABIOMED, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 2,000, 94,000 and 438,000 shares of common
stock underlying outstanding securities primarily related to out-of-the-money stock options and performance-based awards where milestones were not met were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would
be anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, and includes an
estimate of awards that will be forfeited.

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Use of the valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the
expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future
exercises of unexercised options. In addition, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures
are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures, adjusted to the extent historical forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future.

For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and performance conditions, the
Company recognizes compensation costs using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Accruals of compensation cost for an award with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The
cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred provision. The current income tax provision is
calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future income tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards
using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized
for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in
which the differences are expected to impact taxable income.

F-12


ABIOMED, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—(Continued)

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization
of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit at the
largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts
or circumstances, changes in tax laws, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. When applicable, the
Company accrues for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest through income tax expense. As of March 31, 2015, the Company has no material uncertain tax positions and no interest and penalties have been
recognized to date.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

to provide updated
guidance on revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. In doing so, companies may need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today’s guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. This standard was initially released as effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, the
FASB has tentatively decided to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year. The new guidelines can be implemented using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the
standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which it will adopt the standard.

Note 3. Acquisitions

Acquisition of ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH

On July 1, 2014, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with its wholly owned German subsidiary, Abiomed Europe GmbH (“Abiomed Europe”) and Syscore GmbH (“Syscore”),
a limited liability company located in Berlin, Germany, providing for the Company’s acquisition of all of the share capital of ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (“ECP”), a limited liability company incorporated in Germany. ECP is
engaged in research, development, prototyping and the production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft. The Company’s acquisition of ECP closed on July 1,
2014.

The Company acquired ECP for $13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payouts totaling $15.0 million payable to Syscore based
on the achievement of certain technical, regulatory and commercial milestones. These milestone payments may be made, at the Company’s option, by a combination of cash or the Company’s common stock. With respect to such milestone payments,
the share purchase agreement provides:

•

that, upon the earlier of (i) the Company’s receipt of European CE Marking approval relating to the sale of an expandable device based on
certain patent rights acquired from ECP, or (ii) the Company’s bringing of a successful claim against a third party competitor (or reaching an economically equivalent settlement) for the infringement of certain patent rights acquired from
ECP, it will pay Syscore an additional $7.0 million (provided that if such claim or settlement does not prohibit the third party competitor’s further marketing, production, sale, distribution, lease or use of any violating or infringing
products, but only awards monetary damages to the Company or to Abiomed Europe, the amount payable to Syscore shall be limited to the lower of the amount of aggregate damages received and $7.0 million); and

•

that, upon the first to occur of (i) the Company’s successful commercialization of one or more rotatable and expandable devices based on
certain patent rights acquired from ECP, where such devices achieve aggregate worldwide revenues of $125.0 million,

including the revenues of third-party licensees, or (ii) the Company’s sale of (A) ECP, (B) all or substantially all of ECP’s assets, or (C) certain of ECP’s
patent rights, the Company will pay to Syscore the lesser of (x) one-half of the profits earned from such sale described in the foregoing item (ii), after accounting for the costs of acquiring and operating ECP, or (y) $15.0 million (less
any previous milestone payment).

ECP’s Acquisition of AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of ECP, ECP acquired all of the share capital of AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions
(“AIS”), a limited liability company incorporated in Germany, pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated as of June 30, 2014, by and among ECP and AIS’s four individual shareholders. AIS, based in Aachen, Germany, holds certain
intellectual property useful to ECP’s business, and, prior to being acquired by ECP, had licensed such intellectual property to ECP.

The
purchase price for the acquisition of AIS’s share capital was approximately $2.8 million in cash, which was provided by the Company, and the acquisition closed immediately prior to Abiomed Europe’s acquisition of ECP. The share purchase
agreement contains representations, warranties and closing conditions customary for transactions of its size and nature.

Purchase Price
Allocation

The acquisition of ECP and AIS was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price for the acquisition has
been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
on July 1, 2014, the date of acquisition (in thousands):

IPR&D is principally the estimated fair value of the ECP and AIS technology which had not reached commercial
technological feasibility nor had alternative future use at the time of the acquisition and therefore the Company considered IPR&D, with assigned values to be allocated among the various IPR&D assets acquired.

Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The goodwill resulting from these acquisitions arises largely from synergies expected from combining the operations of ECP and AIS with the Company’s existing operations. The goodwill is not deductible for
income tax purposes.

All legal, consulting and other costs related to the acquisition, aggregating approximately $1.1 million, have been
expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The results of operations for ECP and AIS are included in the Company’s consolidated statements
of operations for the period from the July 1, 2014 acquisition date to March 31, 2015. The Company has no material revenues and incurred $2.3 million in net losses from July 1, 2014 through March 31, 2015 associated with the
operations of ECP. This also includes a $0.5 million expense for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration from July 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015.

ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, as if the Company had completed the ECP and AIS acquisitions at the beginning of fiscal 2014. The pro forma financial information is provided for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of what actual results would have been had the acquisition occurred on the date indicated, nor does it give effect to synergies, cost savings, fair market value adjustments, immaterial amortization expense and other changes expected to
result from the acquisition. Accordingly, the pro forma financial results do not purport to be indicative of consolidated results of operations as of the date hereof, for any period ended on the date hereof, or for any other future date or period.
The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and includes adjustments for transaction-related costs, to eliminate revenues earned by AIS from ECP and expenses paid by ECP
to AIS associated with a license agreement between the two parties, interest expense incurred by ECP related to bank loans accounted as if the repayment of ECP debt had occurred on April 1, 2013 and was not outstanding during the periods, and
income tax provision of AIS due to the elimination of revenue on the license agreement with ECP.

(in thousands):

Fair Value Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets
and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Level 1 primarily
consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.

Level
2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment
speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be
derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

Level 3 is
comprised of unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one
significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

Note 4. Marketable Securities and Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

The following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for its financial instruments
measured at fair value as of March 31, 2015 and 2014:

The Company has determined that the estimated fair value of its investments in U.S. Treasury mutual fund securities,
short-term government-backed securities and long-term government-backed securities are reported as Level 2 financial assets as they are not exchange-traded instruments.

The Company’s financial liabilities consisted of contingent consideration potentially payable to former ECP shareholders related to the acquisition of ECP in July 2014. This liability is reported as
Level 3 as estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of the ECP requires significant management judgment or estimation and is calculated using the income approach, using various revenue and cost assumptions and
applying a probability to each outcome.

The following table summarizes the change in fair value, as determined by Level 3 inputs, of the
contingent consideration for the year ended March 31, 2015:

The change in fair value of the contingent consideration of $0.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 was
primarily due to an increase in fair value due to the effect of the passage of time on the fair value measurement of milestones related to the ECP acquisition. Adjustments associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration are
included in research and development expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Other Investments

In May 2013 and September 2014, the Company invested $0.8 million and $0.7 million in preferred stock of a private medical technology company. There are no additional outstanding funding commitments
associated with this investment.

In November 2014, the Company invested $0.5 million in a 0% interest promissory note to a separate private
medical technology company that is convertible into preferred stock of the company based upon a qualified financing as defined in the agreement governing the investment. The promissory note was converted into preferred stock on May 19, 2015.
There are no additional outstanding funding commitments associated with this investment.

In January 2015, the Company invested $0.6 million
in a 5% interest promissory note to another private medical technology company. This promissory note and accrued interest is convertible into preferred stock of the company upon a qualified financing as defined in the agreement governing the
investment. The Company could also be required to invest an additional $0.4 million in the form of a promissory note if certain milestones are met.

In March 2015, the Company invested $1.0 million in preferred stock of a private medical technology company. There are no additional outstanding funding commitments associated with this investment.

The Company’s other investments are accounted for using the cost method and are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis only if
there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these investments. The aggregate carrying amount of these investments was $3.6 million and $0.8 million at March 31, 2015
and March 31, 2014, respectively, and is classified within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Note 8. Goodwill and In-Process Research and Development (Continued)

The Company has no accumulated impairment losses on goodwill. The Company performed a Step 0 qualitative
assessment during the annual impairment review for fiscal 2015 as of October 31, 2014 and concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Therefore,
the two-step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary in fiscal 2015.

As described in Note 3.
“Acquisitions,” in July 2014, the Company acquired ECP and AIS and recorded $18.5 million of IPR&D. The estimated fair value of the IPR&D was determined using a probability-weighted income approach, which discounts expected future
cash flows to present value. The projected cash flows from the expandable catheter pump technology were based on certain key assumptions, including estimates of future revenue and expenses, taking into account the stage of development of the
technology at the acquisition date and the time and resources needed to complete development. The Company used a discount rate of 22.5% and cash flows that have been probability adjusted to reflect the risks of product commercialization, which the
Company believes are appropriate and representative of market participant assumptions.

The carrying value of the Company’s IPR&D
assets and the change in the balance for the year ended March 31, 2015 is as follows:

Note 9. Stockholders’ Equity

Class B Preferred Stock

The Company has authorized 1,000,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock, $.01 par value, of which the Board of Directors can set the designation, rights and privileges. No shares of Class B
Preferred Stock have been issued or are outstanding.

Stock Repurchase Program

In November 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $15.0 million of its common stock. The Company
financed the stock repurchase program with its available cash. During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company repurchased 1,123,587 shares for $15.0 million in open market purchases at an average cost of $13.39 per share, including
commission expense. The Company completed the purchase of common stock under this stock repurchase program in January 2013.

Note 10. Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation

Stock Award Plans

The Company grants stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and others. All outstanding stock options of the Company as of March 31,
2015 were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. Outstanding stock options, if not exercised, expire 10 years from the date of grant.

The Company’s 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) authorizes the grant of a variety of equity awards to the Company’s officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisers,
including awards of unrestricted and restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock, performance share awards and stock appreciation rights. The Plan provides that options may
only be granted at the current market value on the date of grant. Each share of stock issued pursuant to a stock option or stock appreciation right counts as one share against the maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan, while each share of
stock issued

Note 10. Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

pursuant to any other type of award counts as 1.58 shares against the maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan for grants made on or after August 11, 2010 (and as 1.5 shares for
grants made prior to that date). The Company’s policy for issuing shares upon exercise of stock options or the vesting of its restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is to issue shares of common stock at the time of exercise or
conversion. At March 31, 2015, a total of approximately 1,841,000 shares were available for future issuance under the Plan.

Note 10. Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $20.0
million, $16.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively. The total cash received as a result of employee stock option exercises during the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $10.9 million, $9.4 million and $2.9 million,
respectively. The total fair value of options vested in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2.6 million, $2.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

The weighted average grant-date fair value for options granted during the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $9.29, $9.85 and $9.66 per share, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option granted at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of
options granted during the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were calculated using the following weighted average assumptions:




Risk-free interest rate

1.60

%

0.94

%

0.78

%

Expected option life (years)

4.19

4.25

4.31

Expected volatility

49.3

%

51.7

%

56.2

%

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term
consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock and adjustments for factors not reflected in historical volatility that may be more
indicative of future volatility. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options. An expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation
model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company estimates forfeitures based on an analysis of actual historical forfeitures, adjusted to the extent historic
forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future.

Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

The following table summarizes restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015:

The remaining unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units, including
performance-based awards, as of March 31, 2015 was $10.9 million and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.7 years.

The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock and restricted stock units granted during the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $22.07, $23.34 and $21.82 per share,
respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $11.2 million, $6.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively.

Performance-Based Awards

Included in the restricted stock and restricted stock
units activity discussed above are certain awards that vest subject to certain performance-based criteria.

Note 10. Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

In May 2014, performance-based awards of restricted stock units for the potential issuance of 379,752
shares of common stock were issued to certain executive officers and employees, all of which vest upon achievement of prescribed service milestones by the award recipients and performance milestones by the Company. The Company met the prescribed
performance milestones in fiscal 2015 such that the remaining outstanding 373,938 shares of common stock as of March 31, 2015 will vest subject to service requirements for vesting for these employees and the compensation expense is being
recognized accordingly over the remaining service term.

In March 2014, the Company modified the performance condition on 50,000 restricted
stock units originally granted in June 2011. As of March 31, 2015, the Company believes that it is probable that the prescribed performance milestones will be met and the compensation expense is being recognized accordingly.

In May 2013, performance-based awards of restricted stock units for the potential issuance of 268,988 shares of common stock were issued to certain
executive officers and employees, all of which vest upon achievement of prescribed service milestones by the award recipients and performance milestones by the Company. The Company met the prescribed performance milestones in fiscal 2014 such that
the remaining outstanding 149,265 shares of common stock as of March 31, 2015 will vest subject to service requirements for vesting for these employees and the compensation expense is being recognized accordingly over the remaining service
term.

In May 2012, performance-based awards of restricted stock units for the potential issuance of 195,188 shares of common stock were
issued to certain executive officers and employees of the Company, all of which will vest upon achievement of prescribed service milestones by the award recipients and performance milestones by the Company. The Company met the prescribed performance
milestones in fiscal 2013 such that the remaining outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2015 will vest subject to service requirements for vesting for these employees and the compensation expense is being recognized accordingly
over the remaining service term.

During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company has recorded $8.0 million in stock-based compensation
expense for equity awards in which the prescribed performance milestones have been achieved or are probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these equity awards at March 31, 2015 is $4.3 million
based on the Company’s current assessment of probability of achieving the performance milestones. The weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.5 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan, or
ESPP. Under the ESPP, eligible employees, including officers and directors, who have completed at least three months of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries who elect to participate in the purchase plan instruct the Company to withhold a
specified amount of the employee’s income each payroll period during a six-month payment period (the periods April 1—September 30 and October 1—March 31). On the last business day of each six-month payment period, the amount
withheld is used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to 85% of the lower of its market price on the first business day or the last business day of the payment period. The Company recognized compensation
expense of $0.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the ESPP.

Note 11. Income Taxes (Continued)

A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax
rate is as follows for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013:

The Company classifies its deferred tax assets and liabilities as current or non-current based on the classification of
the related asset or liability for financial reporting giving rise to the temporary difference. A deferred tax asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets related to net operating loss
(“NOL”) carryforwards, is classified in current or long-term according to the expected reversal date.

The Company regularly
assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company
evaluated all available positive and negative evidence, and weighted the evidence based on its objectivity. Prior to March 31, 2015, the Company had determined that the objectively verifiable negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence
due to its history of net operating losses incurred for most of its existence, the then-pending status of the Company’s Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for its
Impella 2.5 product in the U.S., among other factors, and as a result it recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company determined based on its consideration of the weight of positive and negative evidence that
there was sufficient positive evidence that most of its federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not recoverable as of March 31, 2015. The Company’s conclusion was primarily driven by the Company’s
receipt of PMA approval for its Impella 2.5 product in March 2015, the $28.8 million of income before taxes in fiscal 2015, its history of profits in recent years and its expectation for sustainable future profitability now that it has obtained PMA
approval for Impella 2.5. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $101.5 million reversal of the valuation allowance in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, primarily related to the Company expecting to be able to use NOL carryforwards in the future
in the U.S. and Germany.

As of March 31, 2015, the remaining $2.9 million valuation allowance represents deferred tax assets related to
NOL carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has had limited history of profitability. Based on the review of all available evidence, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce these deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realizable as of March 31, 2015.

Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
during the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

ABIOMED, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 11. Income Taxes (Continued)

At March 31, 2015, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of
approximately $175.6 million which expire in varying years from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2034. During the year ended March 31, 2015, state NOLs of approximately $1.5 million expired. At March 31, 2015, the Company had German NOLs of
approximately $32.2 million, which do not expire. In addition, at March 31, 2015, the Company had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $11.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, which expire in
varying years from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2034.

Of the total amount of available U.S. federal NOLs, $63.0 million relates to
stock-based compensation tax deductions in excess of stock-based compensation expense for financial reporting purposes (“excess tax benefits”). Excess tax benefits are realized when they reduce income taxes payable, as determined using a
“with and without” method, and are credited to additional paid-in capital rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision. During the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company realized excess tax benefits from state tax deductions
of $0.6 million which were credited to additional paid-in capital.

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax,
as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. Fiscal years 2012 through 2015 remain open to examination in Germany. All tax years remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities, because
the Company has net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards which may be utilized in future years to offset taxable income, those years may also be subject to review by relevant taxing authorities if the carryforwards are utilized.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

The
following is a description of the Company’s significant arrangements in which the Company is a guarantor.

Indemnifications

—In many sales transactions, the Company indemnifies customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused
by the Company’s products. The indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims. The Company has never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to
sales transactions.

The Company enters into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business, typically with underwriters,
contractors, clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions. Under these provisions the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result
of its activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited.
The Company has never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the estimated fair value of these agreements is immaterial. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities
recorded for these agreements as of March 31, 2015.

Clinical study agreements

—In the Company’s clinical study
agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to uses of the Company’s
devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement, the protocol for the device and the Company’s instructions. The indemnification provisions contained within the Company’s clinical study agreements do not generally include
limits on the claims. The Company has never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in its clinical study agreements.

Facilities leases

— The Company’s headquarters is located at 22 Cherry Hill Drive in Danvers, Massachusetts and consists of approximately 96,000 square feet of space under an
operating lease as of March 31, 2015. On April 30, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the lease in which it agreed to lease an additional 24,560 square feet of space. In addition, the Company has certain rights to terminate the
lease early, subject to the payment of a specified termination fee based on the timing of the termination, as further outlined in the lease amendment. The amendment also grants the Company a one-time right of first offer to lease new space in the
facility and a one-time first right of refusal to buy the facility, subject to certain conditions set forth therein This facility encompasses most of its U.S. operations, including research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing and
general and administrative departments. The monthly lease payments over the term of the lease are as follows:

•

The base rent for May 2014 through December 2015 is $74,050 per month; and

•

The base rent for January 2016 through February 2016 will be $85,818 per month; and

•

The base rent for March 2016 through February 2018 will be $82,518 per month; and

•

The base rent for March 2018 through February 2021 will be $85,030 per month.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

The Company’s European headquarters is located in Aachen, Germany and consists of approximately
33,000 square feet of space under an operating lease. In July 2013, the Company entered into a lease agreement to continue renting our existing space in Aachen, Germany through July 31, 2023. The lease payments are approximately 34,500€
(euro) (approximately U.S. $37,400 at March 31, 2015 exchange rates) per month. The building houses most of the manufacturing operations for the Impella product line as well as certain research and development functions and the sales, marketing
and general and administrative functions for most of its product lines sold in Europe and the Middle East.

Total rent expense for the
Company’s operating leases included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations approximated $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.6 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of March 31, 2015 are approximately as follows:

License agreements

—In April 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Opsens,
Inc. for the rights to certain optical sensor technologies in the field of cardio-circulatory assist devices. Under the agreement, the Company made a $1.5 million upfront payment upon execution of the agreement and agreed to make additional payments
of up to $4.5 million upon achievement of development milestones.

The Company is also party to a license agreement related to certain
circulatory care device patents and know-how. Under this agreement, the Company would be obligated to pay up to $3.0 million in cash or stock, if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved.

Contingencies

From time to time, the
Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, would require significant expenditures. The Company records a liability
in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and
adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss. If the loss is not probable
or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial statements.

On October 26, 2012, the
Company was informed that the Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia was conducting an investigation, or the “Marketing and Labeling Investigation”, focused on its marketing and labeling of
the Impella 2.5. On October 31, 2012, the Company accepted service of a subpoena related to this investigation seeking documents related to the Impella 2.5. The Company believes that it has substantially complied with the subpoena and has
submitted the requested documents to the United States Attorney’s Office. On September 13, 2013, the Company entered into a tolling agreement with the United States Attorney’s Office, pursuant to which the Company and the United
States Attorney’s Office mutually agreed to toll the applicable statutes of limitations for all criminal, civil and administrative offenses and violations that could be charged or claimed against the Company as of that date. On May 27,
2014 and January 30, 2015, the Company executed extensions of the tolling agreement. These extensions expired on March 2, 2015. The investigation is ongoing and is unable to predict the ultimate outcome or determine whether a liability has
been incurred or make an estimate of the reasonably possible liability, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome associated with this investigation. The Company has incurred significant expenses related to this investigation and it
could continue to incur additional expenses in the future related to this action.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

On February 6, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, or the First Circuit,
affirmed the dismissal by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, or the District Court, of a previously disclosed complaint brought by alleged purchasers of the Company’s common stock, on behalf of themselves and persons or
entities that purchased or acquired common stock of the Company between August 5, 2011 and October 31, 2012. The complaint related to two previously reported complaints that were filed on November 16 and 19, 2012 and alleged that the
Company and certain of its officers violated federal securities laws in connection with disclosures related to the Company’s marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5 product and sought damages in an unspecified amount. The District Court
consolidated these complaints, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs on May 20, 2013. On July 8, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated class action. The Company does not expect any
further activity related to this matter.

On April 25, 2014, the Company received a subpoena from the Boston regional office of the
United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General requesting materials relevant to the Company’s reimbursement of expenses and remuneration to healthcare providers for a six month period from July 2012
through December 2012 in connection with a civil investigation under the False Claims Act (the “FCA Investigation” and, together with the Marketing and Labeling Investigation, the “DOJ Investigations”). The Company submitted the
requested documents to HHS and believes that it substantially complied with the subpoena. On November 6, 2014, the Company received notice from the Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts in
the form of a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) requesting additional materials relating to this matter for the time period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. The Company is currently is the process of responding to
the additional requests for information contained in the CID and intends to continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in connection with the FCA investigation.

The Company is unable to estimate a potential liability with respect to the DOJ Investigations. There are numerous factors that make it difficult to meaningfully estimate possible loss or range of loss at
this stage of these investigations and lawsuits, including that: the proceedings are in relatively early stages, there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved and information obtained or rulings made during any lawsuits or
investigations could affect the methodology for calculation. In addition, with respect to claims for which damages are the requested relief, no amount of loss or damages has been specified. Therefore, the Company is unable at this time to estimate
its possible losses and accordingly, no adjustment has been made to the financial statements to reflect the outcome of these uncertainties.

Note 13. Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses consisted of the following:

Accrued employee compensation consists primarily of accrued bonuses, accrued commissions and accrued employee benefits at
March 31, 2015 and 2014.

Note 14. Segment and Enterprise Wide Disclosures

The Company operates in one business segment—the research, development and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the
pumping function of the failing heart. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (determined to be the Chief Executive Officer) does not manage any part of the Company separately, and the allocation of resources and assessment of performance
are based on the Company’s consolidated operating results. Approximately 77% and 74% of the Company’s total consolidated assets are located within the U.S. as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The remaining assets are mostly
located in Europe and are primarily related to the Company’s Impella production

acquisition in May 2005 and ECP acquisition in July 2014. Total assets outside of the U.S. excluding goodwill amounted to 10% and 8% of total consolidated assets at March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. International sales (sales outside the
U.S. and primarily in Europe) accounted for 10%, 9% and 7% of total product revenue during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
