PART I
Item 1.  BUSINESS

  General Development of Business

	(a)	Hormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by 
George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota as George A. Hormel 
& Company.  The Company started as a processor of meat and food 
products and continues in this line of business.  The Company 
name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995.  
The parent company is primarily engaged in the production of a 
variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those 
products throughout the United States.  Although pork remains the 
major raw material for Hormel products, the Company has 
emphasized for several years the manufacture and distribution of 
branded, consumer packaged items rather than the commodity fresh 
meat business.  New product introductions the past few years have 
emphasized a variety of branded turkey products produced and sold 
under the Jennie-O label and the fast growing ethnic food market 
with Chi-Chi's line of Mexican foods, House of Tsang oriental 
sauces and food products, and Mediterranean food products under 
the Marrakesh Express and Peloponnese labels.

		In October 1996, the Company purchased Stagg Foods, Inc., a 
leading West Coast producer of chili and stew products through an 
exchange of stock.  Stagg Foods is operated as part of the     
main Hormel business.

		The Company's larger subsidiaries include Jennie-O Foods, Inc.; 
Dubuque Foods, Inc.; Hormel Foods International Corporation and 
Vista International Packaging, Inc.

		Jennie-O, a Willmar, Minnesota based turkey processor, markets 
its products nationwide through its own sales force and brokers, 
providing the Company with a significant presence in this 
important segment of the industry.

		Dubuque Foods, Inc. formerly named FDL Marketing, Inc. was formed 
in 1985 to be the exclusive marketer of the production of FDL 
Foods, Inc., a Dubuque, Iowa, meat packer.  In July of 1993, the 
Company acquired through two subsidiaries, Dubuque Foods, Inc. 
and Rochelle Foods, Inc., a portion of the assets of FDL Foods.  
Dubuque Foods acquired the FDL Foods brands and trademarks.  
Rochelle Foods acquired the FDL Foods manufacturing operations at 
Rochelle, Illinois.  Rochelle Foods is a co-packer for both 
Hormel and Dubuque Foods.  Dubuque Foods has no production 
facilities and contracts with various co-packers to supply 
product under its label.

		The Company markets its products internationally through Hormel 
Foods International Corporation.  Hormel Foods International has 
been increasing its presence in the international marketplace 
through joint ventures and placement of personnel in strategic 
foreign locations.  Joint ventures have been established in 
Mexico, China, and Australia.  Hormel International marketing and 
sales personnel are located in Spain, China and Australia.


Item 1.  BUSINESS--CONTINUED

		Investment of personnel and capital in the foreign operations of 
the business is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  
During 1996 minority investments were made in food companies in 
Poland and Spain which resulted in an increased Hormel presence 
in those area.
		
		Vista International Packaging, Inc. imports, customizes, and 
distributes a variety of natural and artificial casings for the 
meat and food processing industry.

		Late in 1996, the Company announced its intention to exit the 
fish business either through sale or closure of its subsidiary 
Farm Fresh Catfish Company.  The sale of Farm Fresh was 
negotiated and closed during the first quarter of 1997.

		During the first quarter of fiscal 1998 the Company announced an 
agreement to sell its bulk gelatin/specialized protein plant and 
business located in Davenport, Iowa to Goodman Fielder Limited of 
Sydney, Australia for $71,400,000.  The 125 production and 
administrative employees in Davenport are included in the sale 
agreement.  The sale is expected to close late in January 1998.

		The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership 
or similar proceedings during its history.  Substantially all of 
the assets of the Company have been acquired in the ordinary 
course of business.

		The Company had no significant change in the type of products 
produced or services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of 
distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.

Industry Segment

(b)	 Hormel Foods Corporation is engaged in a single industry segment 
	 "Meat and Food Processing".  The meat and food processing 
	 industry is very competitive with respect to price, marketing 
	 and customer service.  In addition to meat processing firms, 
	 the Company competes with consumer packaged food manufacturers
	 as well as seafood, poultry and vegetable protein processors.

Description of Business

	(c)	The principal products of the Company are meat and food products 
which are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned.

		The percentage of total revenues contributed by classes of 
similar products for the last three fiscal years of the Company 
are as follows:

	Year Ended
	  October	October	October
	  25,1997	26,1996 	28, 1995

	Meat Products 	  54.1%   	52.6%	54.4%
	Prepared Foods 	  26.5    	28.1 	28.0
	Poultry, Fish, Other       19.4     19.3	  17.6	
	   100.0%   100.0%	100.0%



Item 1.  BUSINESS--Continued

	Meat Products includes fresh meats, sausages, hams, wieners and 
bacon.  Prepared Foods products include canned luncheon meats, 
shelf stable microwaveable entrees, stews, chilies, hash, meat 
spreads and frozen processed products.  Jennie-O turkey and 
Farm Fresh catfish products are included in the Poultry, Fish 
and Other category.

	Hormel Foods has numerous trademarks and patents which are 
important to the Company's business.  Some of the trademarks 
are registered and some are not.  The more  significant 
trademarks are:  HORMEL, BLACK LABEL, BY GEORGE, CURE 81, 
CUREMASTER, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, HOMELAND, LAYOUT PACK, LIGHT 
& LEAN, LITTLE SIZZLERS, MARY KITCHEN, RANGE BRAND, ROSA 
GRANDE, SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, WRANGLERS, JENNIE-O,  KID'S 
KITCHEN, FAST 'N EASY, DUBUQUE, QUICK MEAL, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, and 
HOUSE OF TSANG.  The Company holds 15 foreign and 24 U. S. 
patents.

	The Company for the past several years has been concentrating 
on processed, consumer branded products with year round demand 
to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commodity 
type products.  Pork continues to be the primary raw material 
for Company products.  Although, live pork producers are moving 
toward larger and more efficient year round confinement 
operations, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply 
of fresh pork materials.  The expanding line of processed items 
has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of Company 
results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

	Quarterly results for fiscal 1997 and 1996 are reported on page 
29, Note K to the financial statements in the Annual Report to 
Stockholders for 1997.

	On October 25, 1997, the Company had unused lines of credit of 
$24,475,000.  A fee is paid for the availability of fixed 
credit lines.  Long-term debt consists of a private placement  
of Senior Notes for $110,000,000 maturing October 15, 2002 and 
October 15, 2006; and $64,400,000 of long-term notes, 
denominated in Spanish Pesetas, used to purchase a 21.4 percent 
equity interest in Campofrio Alimentacion, S.A., Madrid, Spain.  
To provide an almost perfect hedge against currency 
fluctuations, the investment in Campofrio was also made in 
Pesetas.  Other long-term debt includes $5,700,000 in small 
issue Industrial Revenue Bonds of varying maturities and 
$11,046,000 of promissory notes through 2008 secured by limited 
partnership interests in the Federal Affordable Housing 
Program.

	Financial resources and anticipated funds from operations are 
considered adequate to meet normal operating cash requirements 
in 1998.

	The Company has no customers the loss of which would have a 
significant effect on the Company's business.  During fiscal 
year 1997, no customer accounted for more than 5.3% of sales.  
Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature 
of a large portion of the products and orders are accepted and 
shipped on a current basis.



Item 1.  BUSINESS--Continued

	The Company continues to develop and introduce new products 
each year.  No new product in 1997 required a material 
investment of Company assets.  Improving and developing new 
products is the responsibility of task forces including 
personnel from operations, marketing, administration,
	engineering, and research and development.  Research and 
development expenditures for fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively, were $8,580,000, $8,022,000, and $7,829,212.  
There are 29 professional employees engaged in full time 
research, 18 in the area of improving existing products and 11 
in developing new products.

	As of October 25, 1997, the Company had over 11,000 active 
employees.
	
	Livestock slaughtered by the parent company is purchased by 
Company buyers, commission dealers, sale barns, terminal 
markets or under long-term supply contracts at locations 
principally in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and South 
Dakota.  The level of pork production in the United States has 
an impact on Hormel's operations.  Any significant decrease in 
the supply of pork has an adverse effect because of higher 
costs and lower margins coupled with an under-utilization of 
Company facilities.  A significant increase in the supply of 
pork normally results in lower costs and higher margins.  To 
minimize supply variations which impact profitability the live 
pork industry is rapidly moving to very large, vertically 
integrated, year-round confinement operations.  The Company, as 
its major competitors, continues to implement options to 
maximize the benefits of reduced volatility in the supply of 
fresh pork through long-term contracts and supply agreements.

	Products under the Hormel label are sold in all 50 states by 
the parent Company.  Products are sold by approximately 575 
sales personnel operating in assigned territories coordinated 
from district sales offices located in most of the larger 
United States cities, and by approximately 450 brokers and 
distributors.  Distribution of products to customers is by 
common carrier.

	The parent Company has a plant at Fremont, Nebraska, that 
slaughters livestock for processing.  The slaughter facilities 
at the Austin, Minnesota plant are leased to Quality Pork 
Processors of Dallas, Texas under a custom slaughter 
arrangement with the Company. A subsidiary, Rochelle Foods, 
Inc., Rochelle, Illinois, also provides the Company with needed 
raw materials and product through its pork slaughter and 
processing operation.

	Facilities that produce manufactured items are located in 
Algona, Iowa; Austin, Minnesota; Beloit, Wisconsin; Aurora, 
Illinois; Osceola, Iowa; Fremont, Nebraska; Knoxville, Iowa; 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Stockton, California; Tucker, Georgia; 
and Wichita, Kansas.  Custom manufacturing for Hormel is 
performed by several companies including Owatonna Canning 
Company, Owatonna, Minnesota; Lakeside Packing Company, 
Plainview, Minnesota; and Western Steer Mom and Pops of 
Claremont, North Carolina.  Power Logistics, Inc. operates a 
distribution center for the Company at Osceola, Iowa.

            JENNIE-O FOODS

	Jennie-O Foods, Inc., a Willmar, Minnesota, based turkey 
processor, has turkey raising, slaughter and processing 
operations at various locations within Minnesota.  Jennie-O 
contracts with turkey growers to supplement the turkeys it 
raises to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds 
	and processed turkey products.  As part of Jennie-O's long term 
expansion program,the Heartland Food Company plant in Marshall, 
Minnesota was purchased in October 1997.

	HORMEL FOODS INTERNATIONAL

	Hormel Foods International Corporation markets the Company's 
products in international areas including the Philippines, 
Japan and various European countries. The Company, through 
Hormel Foods International, has licensed companies to 
manufacture SPAM luncheon meat overseas on a royalty basis, 
principally Tulip International in Denmark.  Hormel Foods 
International owns Hormel FSC, Inc., a foreign sales 
corporation, which engages in export related activities.  
Hormel Foods International has offices in Australia, China and 
Spain to increase the sales and marketing support in the 
international marketplace.  During 1997 a minority investment 
was made in Campofrio Alimentacion, S.A.,Madrid, Spain.

	VISTA INTERNATIONAL PACKAGING

	Vista International Packaging, Inc., previously a subsidiary of 
Hormel Foods International became a subsidiary of the parent 
company in 1995.  Vista is a food packaging company located in 
Kenosha, Wisconsin which imports, customizes, and distributes, 
a variety of natural and artificial casings for the meat and 
food processing industry.

	DUBUQUE FOODS

		  Dubuque Foods, Inc., formerly called FDL Marketing, Inc., 
		  purchased the brands and trademarks of FDL Foods, Inc.,
		  Dubuque, Iowa, in July of 1993.  FDL Foods also sold its    
            Rochelle, Illinois slaughter and processing operations to 
            Rochelle Foods, Inc., a sister subsidiary of Dubuque Foods.  
            Dubuque Foods has co-packing arrangements with Rochelle Foods 
            and others to manufacture products under its brand names.

the sole transfer agent.

CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS

books of the corporation for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days 
preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders or the date for 
payment of any dividend or the date for the allotment of rights or the 
date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall 
go into effect; PROVIDED, however, that in lieu of closing the stock 
transfer books as aforesaid, the Board of Directors may fix in advance 
a date, not exceeding sixty (60) days preceding the date of any 
meeting of stockholders or the date for the payment of any dividend, 
or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change 
or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect as a 
record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to 
notice of, and to vote at any such meeting, or entitled to receive 
payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights, or 
to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or 
exchange of capital stock, and in such case only such stockholders as 
shall be stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled 
to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting, or to receive payment 
of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to 
exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer 
of any stock on the books of the corporation after any such record 
date fixed as aforesaid.  (Amended November 21, 1966; March 23, 1970)

REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS

37.	The corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any 
share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and accordingly

it shall have express or other notice thereof, save expressly provided 
by the laws of Delaware.

LOST CERTIFICATE

38.	Any person claiming a certificate of stock to be lost or destroyed 
shall make an affidavit or affirmation of that fact and advertise the 
same in such manner as the Board of Directors may require, and the 
Board of Directors may, in their discretion, before issuing a new 
certificate, require the owner of the lost or destroyed certificate, 
or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond, in such 
sum as they may direct, not exceeding double the value of the stock, 
to indemnify the corporation against any claim that may be made 
against it on account of alleged loss of any such certificate; a new 
certificate of the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the 
one alleged to be lost or destroyed may be issued without requiring 
any bond when, in the judgment of the Directors, it is proper so to 
do.

CHECKS AND NOTES

39.	Checks, drafts, orders for the payment of money and promissory notes 
shall be signed or endorsed in the name of the corporation by such

provisions of the certificate of incorporation, may be declared by the 
Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law.  
Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the 
capital stock.

	Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any 
funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as 
the Directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think 
proper as a reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for equalizing 
dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the 
corporation, or for such other purposes as the Directors shall think 
conducive to the interests of the corporation.

INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

42.	The corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable laws 
of the State of Delaware in effect from time to time shall indemnify 
each officer against the expenses of any action to which such officer 
is a party or is threatened to be made a party in any action, suit or 
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative 
(a "proceeding") by reason of the fact that he is or was an officer of 
the corporation; and the corporation may purchase and maintain 
insurance for the purpose of indemnification to the fullest extent 
permitted by said laws.  Notwithstanding any other provision of these 
Bylaws and except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, the 
corporation shall be required to indemnify an officer in connection 
with a proceeding (or part thereof including any counterclaim in any 
proceeding) commenced by such officer only if the commencement of such 
proceeding (or part thereof including any counterclaim in any 
proceeding) by the officer was authorized by the Board of Directors.

	As used in this Bylaw: (i) the term officer means any person who is, 
was or may hereafter be a director, officer, employee or agent of this 
corporation or, at the request of this corporation, of any other 
corporation or of any partnership, joint venture, trust or other 
enterprise and the rights of indemnification under this Bylaw shall 
inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of any 
such persons, (ii) the term action means any threatened, pending, or 
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
administrative or investigative including those by or in the right of 
the corporation and whether or not involving an act or omission of an 
officer in his capacity as such and whether or not he is an officer at 
the time of such action, and (iii) the term expenses of any action 
shall include attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, amounts paid in 
settlement and any other expenses incurred in connection with an 
action but in the case of actions by or in the right of the 
corporation the term shall not include judgments or other amounts paid 
to the corporation.  The foregoing terms shall be construed and shall 
be deemed to be amended from time to time as necessary so as to permit 
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under the applicable 
laws of the State of Delaware then in effect.
	The corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance 
expenses to any Indemnitee who was or is serving at its request as a 
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, 
partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall be 
reduced by any amount such Indemnitee may collect as indemnification 
or advancement of expenses from, or insurance related to, such other 
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise.

(Bylaw 42 added November 20, 1967; amended May 27, 1980; July 28, 
1997)

of Directors.  The Bylaws may also be altered or amended at any

the stock issued and outstanding.
