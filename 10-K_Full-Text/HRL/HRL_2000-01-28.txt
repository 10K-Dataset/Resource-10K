PART I

Item 1.    BUSINESS

(a)

General Development of Business

Hormel
Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota as George A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor
of meat and food products and continues in this line of business. The Company name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995. The Company is primarily engaged in the
production of a variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States. Although pork remains the major raw material for Hormel products, the Company has
emphasized for several years the manufacture and distribution of branded, consumer packaged items rather than the commodity fresh meat business. New product introductions the past few years have
emphasized a variety of branded turkey products produced and sold under the Jennie-O label, the fast growing ethnic food market with Chi-Chi's line of Mexican foods, House of
Tsang oriental sauces and food products, and Mediterranean food products under the Marrakesh Express and Peloponnese labels.

In
1996, the Company purchased Stagg Foods, Inc., a leading West Coast producer of chili and stew products through an exchange of stock. Stagg Foods is operated as part of the
main Hormel business.

The
Company's larger subsidiaries include Jennie-O Foods, Inc., Hormel Foods International Corporation and Vista International Packaging, Inc.

Jennie-O
markets its products nationwide through its own sales force and brokers, providing the Company with a significant presence in this important category of the
industry.

Internationally
the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation. Hormel Foods International has been increasing its presence in the international
marketplace through joint ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as China and Spain. Investment of personnel and capital in foreign operations is expected to continue
for the foreseeable future. Minority investments in food companies in Spain and the Philippines have resulted in an increased Hormel presence in those areas.

Vista
International Packaging, Inc., imports, customizes and distributes a variety of natural and artificial casings for the meat and food processing industry.

The
Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all of the assets of the Company have been acquired in the
ordinary course of business.

The
Company had no significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.

(b)

Industry Segment

Hormel
Foods Corporation is engaged in a single industry segment "Meat and Food Processing". The meat and food processing industry is very competitive with respect to price, marketing
and customer service. In addition to meat processing firms, the Company competes with consumer packaged food manufacturers as well as seafood, poultry and vegetable protein processors.

(c)

Description of Business

The
principal products of the Company are meat and food products which are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned.

The
percentage of total revenues contributed by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the Company are as follows:

Meat
Products includes fresh meats, sausages, hams, wieners and bacon. Prepared Foods products include canned luncheon meats, shelf stable microwaveable entrees, stews, chilies, hash,
meat spreads and frozen processed products. Jennie-O turkey products are included in the Poultry, and Other category.

There
are numerous trademarks and patents which are important to the Company's business. Some of the trademarks are registered and some are not. In recognition of the importance of
these assets, the Company created a subsidiary, Hormel Foods LLC, in 1998 to create, own, maintain and protect trademarks and patents. Some of the more significant trademarks owned or licensed are:
HORMEL, ALWAYS TENDER, AMERICAN CLASSICS, BLACK LABEL, CHI-CHI'S, CURE 81, CUREMASTER, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DUBUQUE, EL TORITO, FAST 'N EASY, HERB-OX, HERDEZ,
HOMELAND, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O, KID'S KITCHEN, LAYOUT, LITTLE SIZZLERS, MARRAKESH EXPRESS, MARY KITCHEN, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, PATAK'S, PELOPONNESE, PILLOW PACK, QUICK MEAL, RANGE BRAND,
ROSA GRANDE,
SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, STAGG, THICK & EASY, and WRANGLERS. The Company holds 14 foreign and 22 U. S. patents.

The
Company for the past several years has been concentrating on processed, consumer branded products with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with
commodity type products. Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products. Although live pork producers are moving toward larger, more efficient year-round confinement
operations, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials. The expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of Company results to raw
material supply and price fluctuations.

The
Company has various lines of credit with a maximum available commitment of $27,300,000. As of October 30, 1999,the Company had unused lines of credit of $13,100,000. A fee
is paid for the availability of the credit lines. Long-term debt consists of $110,000,000 of unsecured medium-term notes of which $35,000,000 matures on October 15,
2002, and $75,000,000 matures on October 15, 2006; $52,200,000 of medium-term unsecured notes, denominated in Spanish Pesetas used to purchase a 21.4 percent equity interest
in Campofrio Alimentacion, S.A. (Campofrio), Madrid, Spain; $4,700,000 in small issue Industrial Revenue Bonds of varying maturities; $5,789,000 of promissory notes with principal and interest paid
annually through 2008 secured by limited partnership interests in the Federal Affordable Housing Program; $22,647,000 in a medium-term variable rate unsecured note, denominated in Euros,
with principal and interest due annually through 2004 used in the Pure Foods-Hormel investment in the Philippines; $14,096,000 in medium-term notes with variable rates, principal and
interest due annually through 2005 secured by various equipment in our China operations; $14,150,000 in variable rate revolving credit debt; and $2,355,000 in other long-term debt. The
notes denominated in Spanish Pesetas provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on the investment in Campofrio.

Financial
resources and anticipated funds from operations are considered adequate to meet normal operating cash requirements in 1999.

The
Company has no customers which would have a significant effect on the Company's business if lost. During fiscal year 1999, no customer accounted for more than 7.0% of sales.
Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products and orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis.

The
Company continues to develop and introduce new products each year. No new product in 1999 required a material investment of Company assets. Research and development expenditures
for fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, were $9,566,000, $9,037,000, and $8,580,000. There are 35 professional employees engaged in full time research; 17 in the area of improving existing
products and 18 in developing new products.

As
of October 30, 1999, the Company had over 12,100 active employees.

Livestock
slaughtered by the Company is purchased by Company buyers and commission dealers at sale barns, and terminal markets or under long-term supply contracts at
locations principally in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and South Dakota. The level of pork production in the United States has an impact on Hormel's raw material cost as well as facility
utilization. The live pork industry has been rapidly moving to very large, vertically integrated, year-round confinement operations.

During
1999, hog producers again brought a large supply of live hogs to market. This abundant supply allowed the Company to benefit from relatively low hog markets for cash hog
purchases. However, a substantial portion of the resulting positive effect of relatively low raw material prices on Company margins was offset by long-term supply agreements designed to
buy hogs through purchasing contracts rather than the spot cash market. The Company's costs for live hogs continued to be higher than the spot cash market. Long-term supply contracts are
used by the Company as a means of assuring a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. Contract costs have been fully reflected in
the Company's reported financial results. As live hog prices rise during the term of these contracts, the Company's cost for hogs will be less than the spot market to the extent that it exceeds
contract prices.

Products
are sold under the Hormel label in all 50 states. Hormel products are sold by approximately 570 Company sales personnel operating in assigned territories coordinated from
district sales offices located in most of the larger United States cities, and by approximately 450 brokers and distributors. Distribution of products to customers is by common carrier.

The
Company has plants in Austin, Minnesota; Fremont, Nebraska; and Rochelle, Illinois that slaughter livestock for processing. The slaughter facility at Austin is leased to Quality
Pork Processors of Dallas, Texas under a custom slaughter arrangement.

Facilities
that produce manufactured items are located in Algona, Iowa; Austin, Minnesota; Aurora, Illinois; Beloit, Wisconsin; Fremont, Nebraska; Houston, Texas; Knoxville, Iowa;
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Osceola, Iowa; Stockton, California; Tucker, Georgia; and Wichita, Kansas. Custom manufacturing for Hormel is performed by several companies including Owatonna Canning
Company, Owatonna, Minnesota; Lakeside Packing Company, Plainview, Minnesota; and Pierre Foods of Claremont, North Carolina. Power Logistics, Inc., operates a distribution center for the
Company in Osceola, Iowa.

Jennie-O
Foods has turkey raising, slaughter and processing operations at various locations within Minnesota. Jennie-O contracts with turkey growers to
supplement the turkeys it raises to meet Company raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products.

Hormel Foods International Corporation markets the Company's products in international areas including the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, Costa Rica and various European countries. The
Company, through Hormel Foods International, has licensed companies to manufacture SPAM luncheon meat overseas on a royalty basis; principally, Tulip International in Denmark. Hormel Foods
International owns Hormel FSC, Inc., a foreign sales corporation, which engages in export related activities. Hormel B.V., a Dutch holding company, holds the investment in Pure Foods Hormel,
Campofrio and Great Barrier Reef in Australia.

Hormel
Foods International has offices in England and China to increase sales and marketing support in the international marketplace. Joint ventures have been established in Costa
Rica, Mexico, China and Australia.

Vista
International Packaging, Inc., is a food packaging company located in Kenosha, Wisconsin which imports, customizes, and distributes a variety of natural and artificial
casings for the meat and food processing industry.
