      Item 1. BUSINESS


      (a)  General Development of Business
           -------------------------------

      Hormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by George A.
      Hormel in 1891 in Austin,  Minnesota  as George A.  Hormel & Company.  The
      Company  started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in
      this line of  business.  The  Company  name was  changed  to Hormel  Foods
      Corporation on January 31, 1995.  The Company is primarily  engaged in the
      production  of a variety of meat and food  products  and the  marketing of
      those products  throughout  the United  States.  Although pork remains the
      major raw material for Hormel  products,  the Company has  emphasized  for
      several  years the  manufacture  and  distribution  of  branded,  consumer
      packaged items rather than the commodity fresh meat business.  New product
      introductions  the past few years  have  emphasized  a variety  of branded
      turkey  products  produced and  sold  under the Jennie-O  label,  the fast
      growing ethnic food market with Chi-Chi's line of Mexican foods,  House of
      Tsang oriental sauces and food products,  and Mediterranean  food products
      under the Marrakesh Express and Peloponnese labels.

      In 1996,  the Company  purchased  Stagg Foods,  Inc., a leading West Coast
      producer of chili and stew  products  through an exchange of stock.  Stagg
      Foods is operated as part of the main Hormel business.

      The Company's larger  subsidiaries  include Jennie-O Foods,  Inc.,  Hormel
      Foods International Corporation and Vista International Packaging, Inc.

      Jennie-O,  a  Minnesota  based  turkey  processor,  markets  its  products
      nationwide through its own sales force and brokers,  providing the Company
      with a significant presence in this important category of the industry.

      The Company  markets its  products  internationally  through  Hormel Foods
      International Corporation.  Hormel Foods International has been increasing
      its presence in the international  marketplace  through joint ventures and
      placement of personnel in strategic foreign  locations.  Significant joint
      ventures have been established in Mexico, China, and Australia. Investment
      of personnel and capital in foreign operations is expected to continue for
      the foreseeable  future.  Minority  investments in food companies in Spain
      and the Philippines have resulted in an increased Hormel presence in those
      areas.

      Vista International Packaging,  Inc., imports, customizes and  distributes
      a  variety  of  natural and  artificial  casings  for  the  meat and  food
      processing industry.

      During fiscal 1998, the Company sold its bulk gelatin/specialized  protein
      plant and  business  in  Davenport, Iowa, to  Goodman  Fielder  Limited of
      Sydney, Australia.

      Item 1.  BUSINESS-Continued

      (a)  General Development of Business-Continued
           -----------------------------------------

      The  Company  has not been  involved in any  bankruptcy,  receivership  or
      similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all of the assets of
      the Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of business.

      The Company had no significant  change in the type of products produced or
      services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of distribution since the
      beginning of the fiscal year.

      (b)  Industry Segment
           ----------------

      Hormel Foods Corporation is engaged in a single industry segment "Meat and
      Food  Processing".   The  meat  and  food  processing   industry  is  very
      competitive  with respect to price,  marketing  and customer  service.  In
      addition to meat  processing  firms,  the Company  competes  with consumer
      packaged  food  manufacturers  as well as seafood,  poultry and  vegetable
      protein processors.

      (c)  Description of Business
           -----------------------

      The principal products of the Company are meat and food products which are
      sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned.

      The  percentage  of total  revenues  contributed  by  classes  of  similar
      products for the last three fiscal years of the Company are as follows:

                              ======             ======              ======


      Meat Products  includes fresh meats,  sausages,  hams,  wieners and bacon.
      Prepared  Foods  products  include  canned  luncheon  meats,  shelf stable
      microwaveable  entrees,  stews,  chilies,  hash,  meat  spreads and frozen
      processed products.  Jennie-O turkey products are included in the Poultry,
      and Other category.

      There are numerous trademarks and patents which are  important to the Com-
      pany's business.  Some of the  trademarks are registered and some are not.
      In recognition of the importance of these assets,  the Company during 1998
      created  a  subsidiary,  Hormel Foods LLC,  to  create, own, maintain  and
      protect  trademarks and patents.  Some of the more significant  trademarks
      owned or licensed are: HORMEL,  ALWAYS TENDER,  AMERICAN  CLASSICS,  BLACK
      LABEL,  CHI-CHI'S,  CURE 81, CUREMASTER,  DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE,  DUBUQUE,

      Item 1.  BUSINESS-Continued

      (c)  Description of Business-Continued
           ---------------------------------

      The  Company  for  the  past  several  years  has  been  concentrating  on
      processed,  consumer  branded  products with year round demand to minimize
      the seasonal  variation  experienced  with commodity  type products.  Pork
      continues to be  the primary raw material for Company  products.  Although
      live pork  producers are moving toward larger, more  efficient  year-round
      confinement operations,  there is still a seasonal variation in the supply
      of fresh pork materials. The expanding line of processed items has reduced
      but not  eliminated  the  sensitivity  of Company  results to raw material
      supply and price fluctuations.

      The  Company  has  various  lines  of  credit  with  a  maximum  available
      commitment  of  $27,200,000.  On October 31, 1998,  unused lines of credit
      were  $16,700,000.  A fee is paid for the  availability  of  fixed  credit
      lines.  Long-term  debt  consists  of  unsecured  notes  for  $110,000,000
      maturing October  15,  2002, and  October 15,  2006;  and  $59,222,000  of
      medium-term  unsecured  notes  used to  purchase  a  21.4  percent  equity
      interest in Campofrio Alimentacion,  S.A. (Campofrio),  Madrid, Spain. The
      notes  denominated in Spanish  Pesetas  provide  a hedge against  currency
      fluctuations on the investment in Campofrio. Other long-term debt includes
      $5,700,000 in small issue Industrial Revenue Bonds of varying  maturities;
      $8,528,000 of promissory notes through 2008 secured by limited partnership
      interests  in the  Federal  Affordable  Housing  Program;  $16,106,000  in
      medium-term notes with variable rates, principal and interest due annually
      through 2005  secured  by various equipment in our China  operations;  and
      $10,551,000 in variable rate revolving credit debt.

      Financial  resources and anticipated  funds from operations are considered
      adequate to meet normal operating cash requirements in 1999.

      The Company has no  customers  the loss of which would have a  significant
      effect on the  Company's  business.  During  fiscal year 1998, no customer
      accounted for more than 6.0% of sales.  Backlog orders are not significant
      due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products and orders
      are accepted and shipped on a current basis.

      The Company  continues to develop and introduce new products each year. No
      new  product in 1998  required a material  investment  of Company  assets.
      Research and  development  expenditures  for fiscal  1998,  1997 and 1996,
      respectively,  were $9,037,000,  $8,580,000, and $8,022,000.  There are 29
      professional  employees  engaged in full time research;  18 in the area of
      improving existing products and 11 in developing new products.

      As of October 31, 1998, the Company had over 11,200 active employees.

      Livestock  slaughtered  by the  Company is  purchased  by Company  buyers,
      commission  dealers,  sale barns,  and terminal markets or under long-term
      supply contracts at locations  principally in Minnesota,  Iowa,  Nebraska,
      Colorado  and South  Dakota.  The level of pork  production  in the United
      States has an impact on  Hormel's  raw  material  cost as well as facility
      utilization. The live pork industry has been rapidly moving to very large,
      vertically integrated, year-round confinement operations.

      Item 1.  BUSINESS-Continued

      (c)  Description of Business-Continued
           ---------------------------------

      During  1998,  hog  producers  brought the largest  supply of live hogs to
      market in  history.  This huge  supply of hogs has  produced  near-record,
      low-market  prices for live hogs on the spot cash  market.  A  significant
      portion of the resulting  positive  effect of lower raw material prices on
      Company margins was offset by long-term supply agreements  designed to buy
      hogs through purchasing  contracts rather than the spot cash market. While
      the  Company's  cost for live hogs  declined  from 1997,  it did not reach
      levels which would be expected from the spot cash market. Long-term supply
      contracts  are used by the Company as a means of assuring a stable  supply
      of raw materials while  minimizing  extreme  fluctuation in costs over the
      long-term.

      During  much of 1998,  live  market  prices  were  below the floor  levels
      guaranteed by our contracts.  Contract costs have been fully  reflected in
      the  Company's  reported  financial  results.  As live hog prices  rebound
      during the term of these  contracts,  the Company's  cost for hogs will be
      less than the spot market to the extent that it exceeds contract prices.

      Products are sold under the Hormel label in all 50 states. Hormel products
      are  sold by  approximately  575  Company  sales  personnel  operating  in
      assigned  territories  coordinated  from district sales offices located in
      most of the larger United States cities,  and by approximately 450 brokers
      and  distributors.  Distribution  of  products to  customers  is by common
      carrier.

      The  Company  has  plants in  Austin, Minnesota;  Fremont,  Nebraska;  and
      Rochelle,  Illinois that slaughter livestock for processing. The slaughter
      facility at Austin is leased to Quality Pork  Processors of Dallas,  Texas
      under a custom slaughter arrangement.

      Facilities that produce  manufactured  items are located in Algona,  Iowa;
      Austin,  Minnesota;  Beloit, Wisconsin;  Aurora, Illinois;  Osceola, Iowa;
      Fremont,  Nebraska;  Knoxville,  Iowa; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;  Stockton,
      California; Tucker, Georgia; and Wichita, Kansas. Custom manufacturing for
      Hormel is  performed  by  several  companies  including  Owatonna  Canning
      Company,  Owatonna,   Minnesota;   Lakeside  Packing  Company,  Plainview,
      Minnesota; and Pierre Foods of Claremont, North Carolina. Power Logistics,
      Inc., operates a distribution center for the Company at Osceola, Iowa.


      JENNIE-O FOODS

      Jennie-O Foods, Inc., a Willmar,  Minnesota,  based turkey processor,  has
      turkey raising,  slaughter and processing  operations at various locations
      within Minnesota. Jennie-O contracts with turkey growers to supplement the
      turkeys it raises to meet its raw  material  requirements  for whole birds
      and processed turkey products.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                October 31, 1998


NOTE A. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


     BUSINESS  OVERVIEW:  Hormel Foods is engaged in a single  business  segment
designated  as  "meat  and  food  processing."  As a  federally  inspected  food
processor,  Hormel is engaged in the  processing  of meat and poultry  products,
production  of  prepared  foods  and the  marketing  of those  products  to food
wholesalers,  retailers and foodservice  distributors in the United States.  The
principal  raw materials  for the  company's  products are pork and turkey.  The
company's  earnings are influenced by the cyclical  nature of these raw material
costs.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:  The consolidated financial statements include
the  accounts  of  Hormel  Foods  Corporation  and  all  of  its  majority-owned
subsidiaries  after  elimination  of  all  significant   intercompany  accounts,
transactions  and profits.  Certain  reclassifications  of  previously  reported
amounts  have been made to  conform  with the  current  year  presentation.  The
reclassifications had no impact on the net earnings as previously reported.

     USE OF ESTIMATES:  The  preparation  of financial  statements in conformity
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.

     FISCAL  YEAR:  The  company's  fiscal  year  ends on the last  Saturday  in
October.  Fiscal year 1998  consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 1997 and 1996
consisted of 52 weeks.

     INVENTORIES:  Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of cost  or  market.
Livestock  and the  materials  portion of products  are valued on the  first-in,
first-out method with the exception of the materials  portion of turkey products
which  are  valued  on  the  last-in,   first-out   method.   Substantially  all
inventoriable  expenses,  packages  and  supplies  are  valued  by the  last-in,
first-out method. Allowances for slow-moving,  obsolete,  unsaleable or unusable
inventories are not material.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost.  The  company  generally  uses  the  straight-line   method  in  computing
depreciation  for financial  reporting  purposes and generally uses  accelerated
methods for income tax purposes.  The annual  provisions for  depreciation  have
been  computed  principally  in accordance  with the  following  ranges of asset
lives:  buildings  20  to 40  years,  machinery  and  equipment  5 to 10  years.
Beginning in 1996, the company  capitalized  certain  software  development  and
implementation   costs.   Prior  to  1996,  such  costs  were  not  significant.
Development  and  implementation  costs  are  expensed  until  the  company  has
determined that the software will result in probable  future  economic  benefits
and  management  has committed to funding the project.  Thereafter,  all direct,
external  implementation  costs and purchased software costs are capitalized and
amortized using the  straight-line  method over the remaining  estimated  useful
lives, not exceeding five years.

     INTANGIBLES: Goodwill and other intangibles are recorded at their estimated
fair values at date of acquisition  and are amortized on a  straight-line  basis
over periods  ranging up to 40 years.  Accumulated  amortization  at October 31,
1998, and October 25, 1997, was $35.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively.

    IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED  ASSETS: The company reviews the long-lived assets,
including identifiable  intangibles and associated goodwill, for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable.  If impairment  indicators are present and the estimated
future  undiscounted  cash flows are less than the carrying  value of the assets
and any related  goodwill,  the carrying  value is reduced to the estimated fair
value as measured by the discounted cash flows.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are  translated  at the current  exchange  rate as of the balance sheet
date,  and income  statement  amounts  are  translated  at the  average  monthly
exchange rate.  Translation  adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange

each investee's equity is reported in the consolidated  balance sheet as part of
investments in affiliates.  The company's only material equity  investment is in
the common stock of a Spanish company, Campofrio Alimentacion, S.A. (Campofrio).
The company  purchased a 21.4  percent  interest in  Campofrio in 1997 for $64.3

related to the sale of its Davenport (Iowa) gelatin/specialized  proteins plant.
The company  acquired Stagg Foods,  Inc., a manufacturer of chili  products,  in
October 1996 for $40.0 million of the company's stock. Additionally, the company
paid $10.0  million in cash to the former  owners  under a five-year  noncompete

goodwill  which is being  amortized  over 30 years.  The company  also  acquired
several other  businesses  during the three fiscal year period ended October 31,
1998,  which are  included  in the  company's  results of  operations  since the

     INCOME  TAXES:  The company  records  income taxes in  accordance  with the
liability method of accounting.  Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated
taxes  ultimately  payable or recoverable  based on enacted tax law.  Changes in
enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.

     EMPLOYEE  STOCK  OPTIONS:  The  company  uses the  intrinsic  value  method
prescribed by Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to  Employees,"  and related  interpretations  in accounting for employee
stock  options.  Under the  intrinsic  value  method,  compensation  expense  is
recognized  only to the extent the market price of the common stock  exceeds the
exercise price of the stock option at the date of the grant.

     EARNINGS PER SHARE:  During the second  quarter of fiscal 1998, the company
adopted Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 128,  "Earnings
per  Share."  All  current  and prior  year  earnings  per share  data have been
restated  to conform to the  provisions  of SFAS 128.  The  company's  basic net
earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the  weighted-average
number of  outstanding  common  shares.  The company's  diluted net earnings per
share is computed by dividing  net  earnings by the  weighted-average  number of
outstanding  common  shares  and the  dilutive  effect  of stock  options,  when
applicable. The following table presents informationive effect of stock options,

     ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:  In June 1997, the
Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Statement  of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income." This statement
establishes  standards  for  the  reporting  of  comprehensive  income  and  its
components in a full set of general-purpose  financial  statements.  The company
will be required to adopt  Statement  No. 130 in fiscal 1999 and does not expect
the measure of comprehensive  income to be materially different from the measure
of net  income.  In June  1997,  the FASB also  issued  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 131,  "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information." This statement revises information regarding the reporting
of operating  segments.  It also establishes  standards for related  disclosures
about products and services,  geographic areas and major customers.  The company
will be required to adopt Statement No. 131 in fiscal 1999. The company does not
believe that the adoption of this statement  will result in segment  disclosures
that are materially  different than those provided under the current  accounting
standards.

In June 1998, the FASB issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
133 June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No.,
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement,
which is  required  to be adopted for annual  periods  beginning  after June 15,
1999,  requires a company to recognize all  derivatives  on the balance sheet at
fair  value.  Derivatives  that are not hedges  must be  adjusted  to fair value
through  income.  If the  derivative is a hedge,  depending on the nature of the
hedge,  changes  in the fair  value of the hedged  assets,  liabilities  or firm
commitments are recognized  through  earnings or in other  comprehensive  income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The  ineffective  portion of a
derivative's  change in fair value will be  immediately  recognized in earnings.
The company has  concluded  that the adoption of Statement No. 133 will not have
an impact on the financial statements.


NOTE B. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES


The company  considers all investments with an original maturity of three months

The health  care cost  trend rate  assumption  has a  significant  effect on the
amount  reported.  For example,  a one percent  increase in the health care cost
trend rate would increase the accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligation by
$19.4 million at October 31, 1998, and the net periodic cost by $1.6 million for
the year.

Deferred  income  taxes  reflect  the net tax effects of  temporary  differences
between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial  reporting
purposes  and the amounts  used for income tax  purposes.  The company  believes
that, based upon its lengthy and consistent history of profitable operations, it
is probable  that the net deferred tax assets of $74.5  million will be realized
on future tax returns,  primarily from the generation of future taxable  income.
Significant components of the deferred income tax liabilities and assets were as
follows:

guaranteeing a loan at October 31, 1998.

The  company  is  involved  on an  ongoing  basis in  litigation  arising in the
ordinary  course of  business.  In the  opinion of  management,  the  outcome of
litigation currently pending will not materially affect the company's results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.



NOTE I. STOCK OPTIONS


The company has stock option plans for employees and nonemployee directors.  The
company's policy is to grant options with the exercise price equal to the market
price of the common stock on the date of grant.  The company follows APB Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related  interpretations
in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the
exercisable  price of employee stock options equals the underlying  stock on the
date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. Options are exercisable upon
grant and expire at various dates ranging from fiscal 2001 to 2008.

Following is a summary of stock option activity:

                                                               Weighted- Average

Pro forma information  regarding net earnings and earnings per share is required
by SFAS No. 123,  assuming the company  accounted for its employee stock options
using the fair value method. The fair value of options was estimated at the date
of the grant using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model with the  following
weighted-average  assumptions for 1998, 1997 and 1996,  respectively:  risk free
interest  rate of 4.5%,  5.9%  and  6.0%;  a  dividend  yield of 2.0%;  expected
volatility  of 24.3%,  22.2% and 22.2%;  and an  expected  option  life of seven
years. The  weighted-average  fair value of options granted in fiscal 1998, 1997
and 1996 was $8.53, $8.17 and $8.17,  respectively.  Exercise prices ranged from
$19.75 to $33.25 with a  remaining  average  contractual  life of seven years at
October 31, 1998.  Pro forma net  earnings  and basic  earnings per share are as
follows  (because SFAS No. 123 is applicable only to options granted  subsequent
to fiscal 1995,  its pro forma effect will not be fully  reflected  until fiscal
2000):

NOTE J. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE


The company  recorded an $8.7 million  restructuring  charge ($5.4 million after
tax or $.07 per  share) in the fourth  quarter of 1996  related to the exit from
its catfish business.  The restructuring charge included accruals related to the
estimated costs associated with closing the fish farms and processing plants and
liquidating the business.  The amount accrued included $3.6 million to close the
farms and fish processing  plants,  $2.7 million and $1.7 million of write-downs
to  estimated  net  realizable  value  related  to fixed  assets  and live  fish
inventory, respectively, and $600,000 of employee related costs.

Although the accruals that were  established  in 1996 were based upon a complete
business  liquidation  which was likely at the time,  the company was ultimately
able to sell the  catfish  business in 1997.  The sale of the  catfish  business
resulted in a change in estimate of the  restructuring  accrual to $3.5 million,
requiring  the  reversal of $5.2  million  ($3.2  million  after-tax or $.04 per
share) of the reserve in 1997.

Hormel Foods Corporation
Austin, Minnesota

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated  statements of financial position
of Hormel Foods  Corporation and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1998 and October
25, 1997,  and the related  consolidated  statements of  operations,  changes in
shareholders'  investment  and cash  flows  for each of the  three  years in the
period ended October 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position of Hormel Foods
Corporation  and  subsidiaries at October 31, 1998 and October 25, 1997, and the
consolidated  results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


(In Thousands of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)

A major goal of the company for a number of years has been to expand its line of
consumer-branded  products. One result of increased sales of branded products is
reduced exposure to fluctuating  commodity prices.  While progress has been made
in reaching this objective, price fluctuations for pork, the company's major raw
material, still had an impact on results in 1998 and 1997.

FISCAL YEARS 1998 AND 1997:
- ---------------------------

During 1998, hog producers  brought the largest supply of live hogs to market in
history.  This huge supply of hogs has produced  near-record,  low-market prices
for live hogs on the spot cash market.  A  significant  portion of the resulting
positive  effect of lower raw material  prices on company  margins was offset by
long-term supply agreements  designed to buy hogs through  purchasing  contracts
rather than the spot cash  market.  While the  company's  cost for live hogs was
lower  than in 1997,  it was not as low as would be  indicated  by the spot cash
market.  Purchasing  contracts  are used by the company as a means of assuring a
stable supply of raw materials  while  minimizing  extreme  fluctuation in costs
over the long-term.

During much of 1998,  live market prices were below the floor levels  guaranteed
by our contracts.  These contract costs, which have been higher than spot market
prices,  have been fully reflected in the company's  reported financial results.
As live hog prices  rebound  during the term of these  contracts,  the company's
cost for hogs will be less than the spot  market to the  extent  that it exceeds
contract prices.

Earnings for the year  increased 27.2 percent to $139,291 from $109,492 in 1997.
Results  for 1998  include  an  after-tax  gain of  $17,402  for the sale of the
company's  Davenport,  Iowa,  gelatin plant to Goodman Fielder Limited,  Sydney,
Australia.  Excluding this one-time gain,  company earnings of $121,889 exceeded
1997 by 11.3  percent.  Net  sales  for the year of  $3,261,045  were  virtually
unchanged from 1997 sales of $3,256,551.  Tonnage volume  increased 10.3 percent
compared to last year. Fiscal 1998 was a 53-week year compared to a 52-week year
in 1997.

Earnings for the fourth  quarter were  $45,152,  an increase of 1.1 percent over
earnings of $44,669 for the same  period last year.  Sales for the quarter  were
$912,037,  a 5.1 percent increase from $868,108 in 1997. Tonnage for the quarter
increased 18.2 percent compared to last year.

The company's  core branded  business  continues to be the major  contributor to
earnings.  All major  divisions  experienced  volume  growth which in many cases
exceeded category growth.  Increased market share and distribution  successes by
some of the  company's  best-known  brands  resulted  in record  profits for the
Foodservice, Meat Products and Prepared Foods Groups.

International's  export  tonnage for the year  increased  8.0 percent from 1997.
Major growth  areas  included  fresh pork,  Jennie-O  turkey  products and Stagg
chili. The Beijing,  China, joint venture began operations in February. Both the
Beijing venture and the Shanghai venture,  which came on line in 1997,  continue
to experience gains in distribution and volume.  The profitability of the equity
investment in Campofrio during the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the
depressed Russian economy.

Jennie-O  tonnage for 1998 increased 23.3 percent over 1997.  Profitability  was
below  expectations  as  highly  competitive  selling  prices  reduced  margins.
Jennie-O's efficient operations and continuing growth in distribution and volume
of value-added  turkey  products  should  position the company to return to more
historical margins when competitive pressure on selling prices moderates.

Selling and delivery  expenses for the fourth quarter and year were $102,028 and
$328,050,  respectively,  as compared to $74,210 and  $297,294  last year.  As a
percentage of sales,  selling and delivery  expenses  increased to 11.2 and 10.1
percent for the quarter and year  compared to 8.6 and 9.1 in 1997.  The increase
in these  expenses is  consistent  with the  increase in tonnage  volume for the
quarter and year.

Marketing  expenses  increased  to $77,232 for the quarter and  $276,826 for the
year compared to $51,063 and $217,637 last year.  These  expenditures  emphasize
the company's  continued  commitment  to expanding its base of branded  consumer
products. As a percentage of sales, marketing expenses increased to 8.5 from 5.9
percent for the quarter and to 8.5 from 6.7 percent for the year.

Administrative and general expenses were $10,813 and $72,331 for the quarter and
year, respectively,  compared to $24,744 and $75,788 in 1997. As a percentage of
sales, administrative and general expenses for the quarter and year were 1.2 and
2.2  percent  compared  to 2.9 and 2.3  percent in 1997.  The change in expenses
between the two quarters was due to a decrease in pension expenses.

Research and  development  continues to be an  important  part of the  company's
strategy  to  extend   existing   brands  and  expand  its   offerings   of  new
consumer-branded  items.  Recognizing the importance of developing,  maintaining
and protecting its intangible asset base of trademarks,  brands and patents, the
company  during 1998 moved its research  activities and  responsibility  for its
intangible  assets into a new  subsidiary,  Hormel  Foods  L.L.C.  Research  and
development   expenses  for  the  quarter  and  year  were  $2,412  and  $9,037,
respectively, compared to $2,212 and $8,580 for the same periods last year.

The  company's  effective  tax rate was  unchanged  at 35.9 percent for 1998 and
1997.


FISCAL YEARS 1997 AND 1996: 
- --------------------------- 

Record high feed grain costs experienced in 1996 moderated  somewhat in 1997 but
remained above historic levels. Although the company was able to improve margins
in 1997,  high raw  material  costs did not allow the return to pre-1996  margin
levels.

Earnings for the year  increased  37.9 percent to $109,492 from $79,408 in 1996.
Net sales in 1997  increased  5.1  percent to  $3,256,551  from  $3,098,685  the
previous year. Tonnage for the year decreased 0.5 percent compared to 1996.

Earnings  for the  fourth  quarter of 1997 were  $44,669,  an  increase  of 47.9
percent  over  earnings of $30,211  for the same  period in 1996.  Sales for the
quarter were  $868,108,  a 1.1 percent  decrease from $877,775 in 1996.  Tonnage
declined 1.2 percent in 1997 compared to the previous year.

The drop in  tonnage  for  both the  quarter  and year was a result  of  reduced
commodity pork sales and the sale of Farm Fresh Catfish Company during 1997. The
increase in earnings, while sales dollars and tonnage either improved marginally
or  declined,  is due to a product  mix which  included a larger  proportion  of
higher margin consumer-processed items.

Tonnage volume in the Grocery Products Division was up 4.5 percent for the year,
due primarily to the Stagg Foods acquisition.  The Meat Products Group completed
the year with tonnage  growth  exceeding  12.0 percent,  continuing the trend of
increased sales of value-added product versus commodity product.  Tonnage of the
Foodservice Group was up 12.0 percent for the year.

In the international  area, the company purchased a 21.4 percent equity interest
in Campofrio  Alimentacion,  S.A. in Spain.  Construction  projects of the China
joint ventures continued as scheduled.  The venture in Shanghai began production
in October 1997. The Beijing venture is scheduled to begin production in January
1998. International tonnage for 1997 increased 26.9 percent over 1996.

Jennie-O  tonnage  increased  12.0  percent  in 1997 with  sales  dollar  growth
exceeding  14.0 percent  compared to 1996.  While tonnage and sales dollars were
up, high feed costs for the year  continued  the squeeze on  historical  margins
that began in 1996. In October 1997,  Jennie-O  acquired the assets of Heartland
Foods in Marshall, Minnesota.

In  1996,  the  company  announced  it  would  exit  the  catfish  business  and
established an after-tax restructuring reserve of $5,400. The sale of Farm Fresh
Catfish  assets in 1997  resulted  in a  favorable  after-tax  reduction  of the
reserve in the amount of $3,200.

Selling  and  delivery  expenses  for the  quarter  and year were  $125,273  and
$514,931,  respectively,  as compared to $124,285 and $503,108  last year.  As a
percentage of sales,  selling and delivery expenses  decreased  slightly to 15.8
percent from 16.2 percent in 1996.  Marketing  expenses increased to $51,063 for
the quarter and  $217,637  for the year  compared to $49,079 and  $209,021  last
year.

Administrative and general expenses were $24,744 and $75,788 for the quarter and
year, respectively,  compared to $20,570 and $75,659 in 1996. As a percentage of
sales,  administrative  and general expenses for the year decreased  slightly to
2.3 percent from 2.4 percent last year.

The company's  effective tax rate decreased to 35.9 percent from 36.7 percent in
1996. The reduction is due in part to increased  affordable housing tax credits,
foreign  equity  earnings  which are net of tax,  a  favorable  completion  of a
federal tax audit and a decrease in state and local taxes.


LIQUIDITY:
- ----------

The company continues to have an exceptionally strong balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term  marketable securities were $238,032 at
the end of 1998,  compared to $152,386  last year.  Long-term  debt  consists of
small  issue  Industrial  Revenue  Bonds of  varying  maturities,  debt used for
investment in the Federal Affordable  Housing Program,  $110,000 in Senior Notes
maturing in 2002 and 2006 and $59,200 of long-term notes  denominated in Spanish
pesetas,  used to purchase a 21.4 percent equity interest in Campofrio in Spain.
The strong balance sheet provides the company with the ability to take advantage
of expansion or acquisition opportunities that may arise.

During 1998,  cash provided by operating  activities  was $229,020,  compared to
$162,489 last year.  The increase in cash provided by operating  activities  was
the result of an increase  in net  earnings,  excluding  the  one-time  gain and
changes in working capital items, which were in the normal course of business.

Cash  required  for  investing  activities  in 1998  decreased  to $58,825  from
$185,054  in 1997.  The  decrease  in cash  required  for  investing  activities
reflects the completion in 1997 of several  construction  projects  primarily at
Hormel  Foods and Jennie-O  Foods,  the cash  required  last year for the equity
investment  in  Campofrio  and the cash  received  on the sale of the  Davenport
gelatin  plant.  At the end of the year,  the company had  commitments to expend
approximately $57,800 to complete construction in progress at various locations.

During the year, the company repurchased 2,251,600 shares of its common stock at
an average price per share of $33.98,  completing  an initial  share  repurchase
plan  authorized in 1996. The company's  Board of Directors  authorized a second
share repurchase plan in September of 1998.  During the fourth quarter,  119,400
shares  were  repurchased  under the new plan at an  average  price per share of
$29.81.


Financial ratios for 1998 and 1997 are presented below:

                                                  1998          1997

YEAR 2000:
- ----------

For many  years,  internally  developed  software  has been  developed  so as to
eliminate the need for revision in the Year 2000.  Less than 5.0 percent of this
category of software  remains to be updated and will be  completed by January 1,
2000.

The  company  has an  ongoing  process  to review the impact of Year 2000 on key
suppliers and customers and on outside  developed  software that runs on company
computers  or is  contained  within  processing  equipment.  Changes  to correct
potential  problems  identified  by  this  assessment  process  are  80  percent
complete. All required changes will be complete by January 1, 2000.

The company has queried its  significant  outside  suppliers and customers as to
their  exposure to Year 2000  problems.  The company is not aware of any outside
supplier or  customer  with a Year 2000 issue that would  materially  impact the
company's results of operations.  However,  the company has no means of ensuring
that outside suppliers and customers will be Year 2000 ready.

The company does not anticipate  delays in finalizing Year 2000 changes and does
not have  contingency  plans for such a  possibility.  The total  historical  or
anticipated remaining costs to remediate Year 2000 problems are not material.


MARKET RISK: 
- ------------ 

The  principal  market risk  affecting the company is the exposure to changes in
interest  rates on the company's  fixed-rate,  long-term  debt.  Market risk for
fixed-rate,  long-term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value
resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent  decrease in interest rates and amounts
to approximately $3.9 million.  The fair values of the company's  long-term debt
were  estimated  using  discounted  future  cash  flows  based on the  company's
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings arrangements.

While  the  company  does  have  international   operations,   and  operates  in
international  markets,  it considers  its market risk in such  activities to be
immaterial.

                                 PROXY STATEMENT

    The enclosed proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of the Company for
use at the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  to be held on January 26, 1999. The
shares  represented by the enclosed  proxy will be voted in accordance  with the
stockholder's directions if the proxy is duly executed and returned prior to the
meeting.  If no  directions  are  specified,  the  shares  will be voted for the
election  of  directors  recommended  by the  Board  of  Directors,  and for the
appointment of Ernst & Young as  independent  auditors for the next fiscal year.
Any person  giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is  exercised  by
contacting the Secretary of the Company.

    The  expenses  of  soliciting  proxies  will be paid by the  Company.  If it
appears  necessary or  advisable,  proxies may be  solicited at Company  expense
personally,  or by  telephone  or  telecopy,  by  directors,  officers and other
employees who will not receive  additional  compensation.  The Company will also
reimburse brokerage firms, and other custodians,  nominees and fiduciaries,  for
their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in sending proxy materials to beneficial
owners.  Your  cooperation in promptly  signing and returning the enclosed proxy
will help to avoid additional expense.

    The Company had 73,495,146 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December
7, 1998.  Each share of stock is entitled to one vote.  The Company has no other
class of shares outstanding.  Only common stockholders of record at the close of
business as of December 7, 1998,  are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the
Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders.  A majority  of the  outstanding  shares  will
constitute a quorum at the meeting.  Abstentions and broker nonvotes are counted
for  purposes  of  determining  the  presence  or  absence  of a quorum  for the
transaction of business.  Shares  represented by abstentions  are counted in the
same manner as shares submitted with a "withheld" or "no" vote in tabulations of
the  votes  cast  on  proposals   presented  to  stockholders,   whereas  shares
represented  by broker  nonvotes  are deemed not  present,  and  therefore,  not
counted for purposes of determining  whether a proposal has been approved.  This
proxy  statement and form of proxy are being mailed to  stockholders on or about
December 30, 1998.


                  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2000 ANNUAL MEETING

    Any  stockholder  intending  to present a proposal at the Annual  Meeting of
Stockholders  to be held in 2000 must arrange to have the proposal  delivered to
the  Company not later than  September  1, 1999,  in order to have the  proposal
considered  for inclusion in the proxy  statement and the form of proxy for that
meeting.

    Additionally, the Company's Bylaw 5 provides certain requirements which must
be met in order for a  stockholder  to bring any  business  or  nominations  for
election as Directors for  consideration  at the annual meeting of stockholders,
whether or not the  business or  nomination  is  requested to be included in the
proxy statement and proxy.  Those  requirements  include a written notice to the
Secretary  of the Company to be received at the  Company's  principal  executive
offices  at least  ninety  (90) days  before the date that is one year after the
prior year's annual meeting.  Management intends to use its discretionary  proxy
authority to vote against any stockholder  proposal for which such notice is not
provided.  For  business  or  nominations  intended  to be brought to the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2000, that date is October 27, 1999.

                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

    It is intended that the persons named as proxies in the enclosed  proxy will
vote for the election of the 14 nominees named below to hold office as directors
until the next Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  and until their  successors are
elected and qualify. In the event any of such nominees should become unavailable
for any reason, which the Board of Directors does not anticipate, it is intended
that the proxies will vote for the election of such substitute  persons, if any,
as shall be  designated  by the Board of  Directors.  Directors are elected by a
plurality  of the votes cast.  The  fourteen  candidates  receiving  the highest
number of votes will be elected.

                             EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

             Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation

    The  Compensation   Committee  (the  "Committee")  consists  exclusively  of
nonemployee  directors,  and is responsible  for setting and  administering  the
policies  that govern the  compensation  of  executive  officers of the Company,
including  the five  executive  officers  named  in this  proxy  statement.  The
Committee also  administers the Company's stock option plans,  Operators'  Share
Incentive Compensation Plan, and Long-Term Incentive Plan.


Philosophy/Objectives

    The Committee's objective is to attract and retain the most highly qualified
executive  officers in a manner which provides  incentives to create stockholder
value.  This objective is  accomplished by  establishing  compensation  which is
calculated to attract and retain the best management  talent  available while at
the same time providing both  significant  risk and opportunity for reward based
on Company performance.

    Executive officer Annual Compensation as related in the Summary Compensation
Table on page 11  consists  of salary and formula  bonus  determined  by Company
earnings under the Company's Operators' Share Incentive  Compensation Plan. Long
Term  Compensation  is provided by stock  options and  restricted  shares  which
provide longer term compensation  opportunities  based on increases in the value
of the Company's  stock,  and by the Company's Long Term Incentive Plan based on
the Company's ranking in cumulative total  shareholder  return over a designated
performance period compared to a pre-selected peer group. In its considerations,
except as noted  below,  the  Committee  does not assign  quantitative  relative
weights  to  different  factors or follow  mathematical  formulae.  Rather,  the
Committee  exercises its discretion and makes a judgment after  considering  the
factors it deems relevant.  The Committee  believes that it has set compensation
at appropriate  levels which reflect each executive's  contribution to achieving
the  Company's  goals  and  in  a  manner  that  ties  the  executive's  earning
opportunity to the welfare of the Company's stockholders.

    In the  Committee's  view,  it is in the  Company's  best  interest to offer
compensation  opportunities  which  enable the  Company  to  compete  with other
American industrial companies for the most effective talent available.  However,
it  is  also  the  Committee's  view  that  such  opportunities  should  involve
compensation  which is  significantly  "at risk" to the fortunes of the Company.
For that  reason,  while  total  Annual  Compensation  is  targeted  to place an
executive's  total  compensation  at the  75th  percentile  of the  compensation
reported  by a  consultant  retained  by the  Company as  described  below,  the
proportion of formula bonus in the compensation  mix will generally  increase as
the executive officer's  responsibilities and compensation increase. In the case
of the five executive  officers  named in the Summary  Compensation  Table,  the
formula bonus exceeds salary for each of the reported years.

Executive Officer Annual Compensation:Salary and Operators' Share Incentive Plan

    Salary is the weekly cash payment which is assured to the executive  officer
as part of the employment relationship.

    The  formula  bonus  determined  by  Company  earnings  under the  Company's
Operators' Share Incentive Compensation Plan, variations of which have been used
by the Company for many years,  is an amount equal to the after tax earnings per
share  reported by the Company at fiscal year end on the Company's  Common Stock
multiplied  by a  designated  number of assumed  shares  ("Operators'  Shares").
Whenever a cash  dividend is  declared on the  Company's  Common  Stock,  a Plan
participant will be paid the amount of such per share dividend multiplied by the
number of Operators'  Shares held by the participant on the dividend record date
at the same time the dividend is paid to stockholders  ("Dividend  Equivalent").
After the end of each fiscal year of the Company,  each participant will receive
a payment equal to the number of Operators'  Shares held by the  participant  on
the last day of the  fiscal  year  multiplied  by the  Company's  after-tax  net
earnings  per  share,  minus  all  Dividend  Equivalents  paid  to or due to the
participant on account of dividends declared during such fiscal year. Operators'
Shares do not  constitute any form of equity  ownership in the Company,  and are
limited to a method for calculating compensation.

    The level of salary and number of Operators'  Shares is determined  annually
in the following manner in the case of each executive officer.


    Each executive officer position has been rated based on evaluation  criteria
provided  by  Hay  Consulting  Group,  an  independent   nationally   recognized
management compensation firm ("Consultant").  The Consultant has rated the Chief
Executive  Officer ("CEO")  position and, with input from the CEO, has rated the
major officer positions  reporting  directly to the CEO, including all executive
officers named in the Summary  Compensation  Table.  Other  executive  positions
within the Company are rated by a job evaluation  committee currently comprising
the Company's two Executive Vice  Presidents,  a Group Vice  President,  and the
Company's  Vice  President of Human  Resources,  utilizing  the  Consultant as a
resource.

    The ratings of each  executive  officer  position are a  measurement  of job
content expressed in numerical points,  measuring qualitative  attributes of the
position  using  a  methodology  developed  by the  Consultant.  The  Consultant
annually assigns a range of compensation values to those numerical ratings using
Consultant's data base drawn from surveys of several hundred American  companies
in a variety of industries.  The Committee has determined that it is appropriate
and in the  Company's  best  interest  to set the policy  guideline  for Company
compensation at the 75th percentile of the range of compensation provided by the
Consultant  for a given  numerical  rating.  Once the level of  compensation  is
established,  the appropriate amount is provided through a combination of salary
and Operators'  Shares.  A significant  percentage of that  compensation for all
executive  officers is provided by awarding  Operators'  Shares. For purposes of
determining the number of Operators' Shares to be awarded, Operators' Shares are
valued  based on a three year  average of Company  earnings.  The basic  concept
underlying  Operators'  Shares  has been  used by the  Company  since  1932 as a
significant  component of executive  compensation.  Compensation from Operators'
Shares  exceeded  salary  for  each  executive  officer  named  in  the  Summary
Compensation Table in each of the past three fiscal years.

    In addition to the salary and  Operators'  Shares  described  above,  Annual
Compensation  has in past years included a discretionary  cash bonus proposed by
the CEO for a small group of  executive  officers  which the  Committee  has the
authority to accept or reject,  and a bonus  provided by the  Committee  for the
CEO. This  discretionary  bonus has been  superceded by the Long-Term  Incentive
Plan described below.


                   Executive Officer Long-Term Compensation:
                 Stock Option Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan

    Acting as the Committee  administering the Company's 1991 Key Employee Stock
Option and Award Plan, the Committee  reviews  recommendations  from the CEO for
the grant of options or Restricted Shares to executive  officers (other than the
CEO) and other eligible recommended employees. The Committee's  determination of
option  grants in fiscal  year 1998 and in past years  reflected  in the Summary
Compensation Table took into consideration the executive  officer's past grants,
compensation  level,  contributions  to the  Company  during the last  completed
fiscal year,  and  potential for  contributions  in the future.  (No  Restricted
Shares were awarded during fiscal year 1998.)

    Options  are  granted at the market  price of the  Company  stock at date of
grant,  and provide  compensation  to the optionee only to the extent the market
price of the stock  increases  between the date of grant and the date the option
is  exercised.  Options are  intended  to provide  long term  compensation  tied
specifically to increases in the price of the Company's stock.

    The total number of options  granted in each year,  which may vary from year
to year, bears a general  relationship to the total number of options authorized
by the Company's  stockholders divided by the number of years in the term of the
Plan under which the options are awarded.  While options are  generally  awarded
based on the  influence an executive  position is considered by the Committee to
have on  stockholder  value,  the number of options  awarded may vary up or down
from prior year awards based on the level of an individual  executive  officer's
contribution to the Company in a particular year, based on the recommendation of
the CEO.

    Company executive  officers are eligible to participate in the "Hormel Foods
Corporation  Long-Term Incentive Plan". This Plan is designed to provide a small
group of key employees  selected by the Committee  with an incentive to maximize
stockholder value. In selecting  participants,  and the amount of cash incentive
which can be earned by each  participant,  the Committee  takes into account the
nature  of the  services  rendered  by the  employee,  his  or her  present  and
potential  contributions to the success of the Company and such other factors as
the Committee deems relevant.

    Under the Long-Term  Incentive Plan the Committee sets specific  performance
goals,  which  are based  solely  on  cumulative  total  return to  stockholders
compared to preselected peer groups.  Performance of the goals is expected to be
measured over three years,  but in no case less than 24 months,  and is expected
to be ranked against a peer group of companies  selected by the  Committee.  The
first  awards  under  this  Plan  were  made  for an  approximately  three  year
performance  period commencing  November 1, 1996, and ending on the tenth day on
which  shares are traded on the New York Stock  Exchange  following  October 30,
1999. At the end of the performance period,  payment will be made for attainment
of the specified  goals based on the increase or decrease in market value of the
Company stock,  together with dividends deemed reinvested,  ("Total  Shareholder
Return")  during the  performance  period ranked  against the Total  Shareholder
Return of the peer group companies.


                      Chief Executive Officer Compensation

    The  cash  compensation  of the  CEO is  established  by  the  Committee  in
generally the same way as cash  compensation  is determined for other  executive
officers,  and the  Committee  employs  generally  the same  criteria for option
grants and Restricted Share awards as apply to other executive officers,  taking
into consideration the CEO's  responsibility for the total enterprise.  Based on
information  received from Hay Consulting Group,  rating Mr. Johnson's  position
and  comparing his annual cash  compensation  to cash  compensation  received by
individuals in other companies in similar  positions,  the Committee awarded Mr.
Johnson  a salary  increase  of  $2,569.23  per week and an  increase  of 35,000
Operators'  Shares which he received in fiscal year 1998, and which is reflected
in the Summary  Compensation Table at page 11. The Committee granted Mr. Johnson
the stock options  reflected in the Summary  Compensation  Table at page 11. The
Committee did not award Mr. Johnson any  Restricted  Shares in fiscal year 1998.
While the salary component of Mr.  Johnson's fiscal year 1998 cash  compensation
was predetermined for the year, the Operators' Shares formula bonus,  comprising
more than half of his fiscal year 1998 cash compensation,  was determined by the
Company's  net earnings  per share for fiscal year 1998 as  explained  under the
heading  "Executive  Officer Annual  Compensation:  Salary and Operators'  Share
Incentive  Plan" on the preceding  page. In addition to salary and formula bonus
under the Operators' Share Incentive  Compensation Plan, as described above, Mr.
Johnson is participating in the Company's  Long-Term  Incentive Plan, through an
award granted to Mr. Johnson by the Committee in fiscal year 1997. The Committee
has not granted Mr.  Johnson any award  under the  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan in
fiscal year 1998. Mr. Johnson's  long-term  compensation  under the Stock Option
Plan and Long-Term  Incentive  Plan, if any, will depend on the Company's  stock
price  relative  to the  exercise  price  of  each  option  granted,  and on the
attainment by the Company of the  performance  goals specified for the Long-Term
Incentive Plan performance period for which the award was made.


Deductibility of Compensation Under Internal Revenue Code Section 162 (m)

    Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code,  adopted in 1993,  imposes a $1
million cap, subject to certain exceptions, on the deductibility to a company of
compensation  paid to the five executive  officers named in such company's proxy
statement.  The stockholders voted at the 1997 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to
amend and approve the Company's 1991 Key Employee Stock Option and Award Plan to
enable  options  granted  under that Plan to qualify as  deductible  performance
based compensation under Section 162(m), so that any compensation  realized from
the  exercise of stock  options  would not be affected  by Section  162(m).  The
stockholders  voted at the 1998 Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  to approve the
Company's  Operators'  Share  Incentive  Compensation  Plan  and  the  Company's
Long-Term Incentive Plan for the purpose of qualifying those plans under Section
162(m).  The  Committee  believes that  compensation  paid pursuant to those two
Plans  will be  deductible,  except  for  Dividend  Equivalents  paid  under the
Operators'  Share  Plan  (which  may not be  deductible  in full  for any  named
executive officer in a given year). Additionally,  cash compensation voluntarily
deferred  by the  executive  officers  named in this proxy  statement  under the
Company's  Deferred  Compensation Plans is not subject to the Section 162(m) cap
until the year paid.  Thus,  compensation  paid this fiscal year  subject to the
Section 162(m) cap is not expected to exceed $1 million for any named  executive
officer.  Therefore the Committee  believes that the Company will not be subject
to any Section 162(m)  limitations on the  deductibility of compensation paid to
the Company's named executive officers for fiscal year 1998.

    The  Committee  continues  to  consider  other  steps  which might be in the
Company's  best  interests to comply with Section  162(m),  while  reserving the
right to award  future  compensation  which  would not comply  with the  Section
162(m)  requirements for  nondeductibility  if the Committee concluded that this
was in the Company's best interests.

         the Table  include  those  amounts  voluntarily  deferred  by the named
         individuals  under the Company's  Deferred  Compensation  Plans,  which
         permit  participants to voluntarily defer receipt of all or part of the

                                         LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS TABLE

   The following table summarizes awards under the Company's Long-Term Incentive
Plan during 1998 to the Chief Executive Officer or the executive  officers named
in the Summary Compensation Table above.


                                  PENSION PLAN

   The Company maintains  noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all employees.  Pension benefits for salaried  employees are based
upon the employee's  highest five years of compensation  (as described below) of
the last 10 calender years of service and the employee's length of service.  The
Company also maintains a supplemental  executive  retirement  plan that provides
pension  benefits  calculated  under the qualified  defined benefit pension plan
formula that exceed the annual  benefit  limitation  for defined  benefit  plans
qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code.  Contingent on Mr. Johnson remaining
employed  with the Company  until at least July 14, 2003, a  Company-established
plan will  credit Mr.  Johnson  with  deemed  years of service  for  purposes of
determining both the amount of and eligibility for retirement benefits under the
Company's  retirement  plans.  The  following  tabulation  shows  the  estimated
aggregate  annual  pension  payable to an employee  under the qualified  defined
benefit pension plan and the supplemental  executive retirement plan upon normal
retirement at the end of fiscal year 1998 at age 65 under various assumptions as
to  final  average  annual  compensation  and  years  of  service,  and  on  the
assumptions  that the retirement  plans will continue in effect during such time
without  change and that the employee will select a single life annuity  option.
The pension  benefits  shown below reflect an integration  with Social  Security
benefits.



                          COMPARATIVE STOCK PERFORMANCE

   The following graph compares the cumulative total  shareholder  return on the
Company's Common Stock during the five fiscal years preceding  October 31, 1998,
with the  Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and the Standard & Poor's Food Group
Index  (assuming the investment of $100 in each vehicle on October 30, 1993, and
the reinvestment of all dividends during such period).

               OTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO DIRECTORS, NOMINEES,
                             AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

           COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     Persons serving as members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year
1998 were William S. Davila, E. Peter Gillette,  Jr. and Joseph T. Mallof.  None
of  such  persons  was an  officer  or  employee  of the  Company  or any of its
subsidiaries  during fiscal 1998,  was formerly an officer of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or had any other relationship with the Company or any of its
subsidiaries requiring disclosure under the applicable rules of the SEC. RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS

   During fiscal year 1998 the Company  purchased 13,345 hogs in ordinary course
of  business  (approximately  2/10 of one  percent  of the  Company's  total hog
purchases)  from Block Farms,  a partnership  owned by Mr. John R. Block and his
son,  at the same  prices  paid by the  Company  to its other  spot  market  hog
suppliers.   During  fiscal  year  1998,   employees  of  the  company  provided
administrative  services to the Hormel Foundation,  which beneficially owns more
than five percent of the Company's common stock, for which the Hormel Foundation
paid the Company  $102,864.17,  reimbursing  the company for its fully allocated
cost for the employee time expended.


                  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP COMPLIANCE

   Section 16(a) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's
directors, certain officers, and any persons holding more than 10 percent of the
Company's Common Stock to report their initial ownership of the Company's Common
Stock  and any  subsequent  changes  in that  ownership  to the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  and the New York Stock  Exchange.  Specific  due dates for
these reports have been established,  and the Company is required to disclose in
this proxy statement any failure to file by those dates during 1998.

   In making these disclosures, the Company has relied on the representations of
its  directors  and officers and copies of the reports that they have filed with
the Commission.

   Based on those  representations  and  reports,  the  Secretary of the Company
inadvertently  made two late Form 4  filings  on  behalf  of  Company  executive
officers. One covered five gifts of shares of the Company's Common Stock made on
the same day by Mr.  Dickson  which were timely  reported by Mr.  Dickson to the
Secretary consistent with Company policy. The other covered intra-plan transfers
of funds out of  Company  stock  funds in two  Company  employee  benefit  plans
occurring on the same day for the account of Mr. James  Jorgenson,  Company Vice
President, for which the Secretary had assumed reporting responsibility.


                       APPROVAL OF APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS

   Subject to  ratification  by the  stockholders,  the Board of  Directors  has
appointed Ernst & Young, independent public accountants,  to audit the financial
statements of the Company and its consolidated  subsidiaries for the fiscal year
which will end October 30, 1999.  Ernst & Young are the present public  auditors
and have served as public  auditors for the Company since 1931.  Representatives
of the firm are  expected  to be present at the  meeting and will be afforded an
opportunity  to make a  statement,  if they desire to do so and be  available to
respond  to  appropriate  questions.  Management  is not aware of any  direct or
indirect financial interest or any other connections Ernst & Young may have with
the  Company  or its  subsidiaries  except the usual  professional  status of an
independent auditor.

   Audit  services  rendered by Ernst & Young for the fiscal year ended  October
31, 1998,  included the  examination of the financial  statements of the Company
and its subsidiaries,  review of certain documents filed by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission,  and examination of the financial statements
of various employee benefit plans.


   The  affirmative  vote  of  the  majority  of  the  shares  of  Common  Stock
represented at the meeting shall constitute ratification. The Board of Directors
recommends a vote FOR the proposal to approve the appointment of Ernst & Young.

                                  OTHER MATTERS

   The  management  of your Company does not know of any matters to be presented
at the meeting other than those mentioned above.  However,  if any other matters
come before the  meeting,  it is intended  that the holders of the proxies  will
vote thereon in their discretion.

                                              By order of the Board of Directors
                                                                     
                                                                     T. J. LEAKE
