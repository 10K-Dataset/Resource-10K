BUSINESS

(a)

General
Development of Business

Hormel Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
Company), was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as
George A. Hormel & Company.  The
Company started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in this
line of business.  The Company name was
changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995.  The Company is primarily engaged in the
production of a variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those
products throughout the United States and internationally.  Although pork and turkey remain the major raw
materials for Hormel products, the Company has emphasized for several years the
manufacture and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items rather than
the commodity fresh meat business.  The
Company has continually expanded its product portfolio through organic growth,
new product development, and the completion of numerous strategic acquisitions.

In March of fiscal 2006, the Company acquired
privately held Valley Fresh, Inc. (Valley Fresh) of Turlock, California.  Valley Fresh has the leading market share in
the canned ready-to-eat chicken category and distributes more than 50
convenient precooked chicken products on a national basis, primarily under the
Valley Fresh brand.

In November of 2006, subsequent to the end of the 2006
fiscal year, the Company acquired the assets of Saag’s Products, Inc. (Saag’s).  Saag’s is based in San Leandro, California,
and is a processor and marketer of branded, premium quality gourmet sausages
and specialty smoked meats

.

In December of 2006, also subsequent to the end of the
2006 fiscal year, the Company completed the acquisition of Provena Foods Inc.
(Provena).  Provena was a publicly traded
company based in Chino, California, which provides pepperoni and pasta to pizza
makers and packaged food manufacturers.

Internationally, the Company markets its products
through Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly owned
subsidiary.  HFIC has a presence in the
international marketplace through joint ventures and placement of personnel in
strategic foreign locations such as Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and the
Philippines.  HFIC also has a global
presence with minority positions in food companies in Mexico (Hormel Alimentos,
50% holding) and the Philippines (Purefoods-Hormel, 40% holding), and in a hog
production and processing operation in Vietnam (San Miguel Pure Foods (VN) Co.
Ltd., 49% holding).

The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy,
receivership, or similar proceedings during its history.  Substantially all of the assets of the
Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of business.

The Company had no significant change in the type of
products produced or services rendered, or in the markets or methods of
distribution since the beginning of the 2006 fiscal year.

(b)

Industry
Segment

The
Company’s business is reported in five segments: Grocery Products, Refrigerated
Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store (JOTS), Specialty Foods, and All Other.  Net sales to unaffiliated customers and
operating profit, and the presentation of certain other financial information
by segment, are reported in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Stockholder’s Report for the
year ended October 29, 2006, incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Description of Business

Products
and Distribution

The Company’s products primarily consist of meat and
other food products.  The meat products
are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked, and canned.  The percentages of total revenues contributed
by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the Company
are as follows:

Reporting
of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as the
same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as
retail, foodservice, or international. 
Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the
Company’s general-purpose financial statements.

Perishable meat includes fresh meats, sausages, hams,
wieners, and bacon (excluding JOTS products.) 
The Poultry category is composed primarily of JOTS products.  Shelf-stable includes canned luncheon meats,
shelf-stable microwaveable entrees, stews, chilies, hash, meat spreads, flour
and corn tortillas, salsas, tortilla chips, and other items that do not require
refrigeration.  The Other category
primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements, sugar and
sugar substitutes, creamers, salt and pepper products, sauces and salad
dressings, dessert and drink mixes, and industrial gelatin products.

In
fiscal 2005, the Company began test marketing

Hormel
Natural Choice

sliced

lunchmeats, which
use high-pressure processing technology. 
Due to successful test market results, this line was rolled out on a
national basis during fiscal 2006.

Natural Choice

deli hams, roast beef, and turkey were also
introduced during the year.  No other new
products in fiscal 2006 required a material investment of the Company assets.

Domestically, the Company sells its products in all 50
states.  Hormel products are sold through
Company sales personnel, operating in assigned territories coordinated from
sales offices located in most of the larger U.S. cities, as well as independent
brokers and distributors.  Dedicated
sales teams also serve major retail customers and coordinate sales of both
Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods products.  As of October 29, 2006, the Company had
approximately 575 sales personnel engaged in selling its products.  Distribution of products to customers is
primarily by common carrier.

Through HFIC, the Company markets its products in
various locations throughout the world. 
Some of the larger markets include Australia, Canada, China, England,
Japan, Mexico, and Micronesia.  The
distribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the China
operations own and operate their own delivery system.  The Company, through HFIC, has licensed
companies to manufacture various Hormel products internationally on a royalty
basis, with the primary licensees being Tulip International of Denmark and CJ
Corp. of South Korea.

Raw
Materials

The Company has, for the past several years, been
concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with year-round
demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commodity-type
products.  Pork continues to be the
primary raw material for Company products. 
Although the live pork industry has evolved to large, vertically
integrated, year-round confinement operations, and supply contracts have become
prevalent in the industry, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of
fresh pork materials.  The Company’s
expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the
sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

The majority of the hogs harvested by the Company are
purchased under supply contracts from producers located principally in California,
Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Canada. 
The cost of hogs and the utilization of the Company’s facilities are
affected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the United
States.  The movement toward year-round
confinement operations which operate under supply agreements with processors
has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market, which decreases
the supply of hogs on the open market. 
The Company, along with others in the industry, uses supply contracts to
manage the effects of this trend and to ensure a stable supply of raw
materials.  The Company has been actively
converting its contracts to market-based formulas to better match input costs
with customer pricing, and all contract costs are fully reflected in the
Company’s reported financial results.  In
fiscal 2006, the Company purchased 81 percent of its hogs under supply
contracts.  The Farmer John operation
also procures a portion of its hogs through farms which the Company either owns
or operates in Arizona, California, and Wyoming.

In fiscal 2006, JOTS raised approximately 57 percent
of the turkeys needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and
processed turkey products.  Turkeys not
sourced within the Company are contracted with independent turkey growers.  JOTS’ turkey-raising farms are located
throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
Production costs in raising turkeys are primarily subject to
fluctuations in feed grain prices and, to a lesser extent, fuel costs.  To manage this risk, the Company periodically
hedges its anticipated purchases of grain using futures contracts.


Manufacturing

The Company has plants in Austin, Minnesota; Fremont,
Nebraska; Vernon, California; and Beijing, China that harvest hogs for
processing.  Quality Pork Processors,
Inc. of Dallas, Texas, operates the harvesting facility at Austin under a
custom harvesting arrangement.

Facilities that produce and distribute manufactured
items are located in Albert Lea, Minnesota; Algona, Iowa; Alma, Kansas; Aurora,
Illinois; Austin, Minnesota; Beloit, Wisconsin; Bondurant, Iowa; Bremen,
Georgia; Browerville, Minnesota; Chino, California; Ft. Dodge, Iowa; Fremont,
Nebraska; Knoxville, Iowa; Lathrop, California; Long Prairie, Minnesota;
Mitchellville, Iowa; New Berlin, Wisconsin; Osceola, Iowa; Perrysburg, Ohio;
Quakertown, Pennsylvania; Rochelle, Illinois; San Leandro, California;
Savannah, Georgia; Sparta, Wisconsin; St. Paul, Minnesota; Stockton,
California; Tucker, Georgia; Turlock, California; Vernon, California; Visalia,
California; Wichita, Kansas; Beijing, China; and Shanghai, China.  Albert Lea Select Foods, Inc. of Dallas,
Texas, operates the processing facility at Albert Lea under a custom
manufacturing agreement.  The Company’s
Houston, Texas facility was closed during fiscal 2006.  Company products are also custom manufactured
by several other companies.  The
following are the Company’s larger custom manufacturers: Steuben Foods,
Jamaica, New York; Lakeside Packing Company, Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Schroeder
Milk, Maplewood, Minnesota; Reichel Foods, Rochester, Minnesota; Power
Packaging, St. Charles, Illinois; and Tony Downs, St. James, Minnesota.  Power Logistics, Inc., based in St. Charles,
Illinois, operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio, and
Osceola, Iowa.

The Company’s turkey harvest and processing operations
are located in Barron, Wisconsin; Faribault, Minnesota; Melrose, Minnesota;
Montevideo, Minnesota; Pelican Rapids, Minnesota; and Willmar, Minnesota.

Patents
and Trademarks

There are numerous patents and trademarks that are
important to the Company’s business.  The
Company holds 6 foreign and 50 U.S. issued patents.  Some of the trademarks are registered and some
are not.  Some of the more significant
owned or licensed trademarks used in the Company’s segments are:

HORMEL, ALWAYS TENDER, AUSTIN BLUES, BLACK LABEL,
BREAD READY, CAFÉ H, CALIFORNIA NATURAL, CARAPELLI, CHI-CHI’S, CURE 81,
CUREMASTER, DAN’S PRIZE, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DODGER DOGS, DUBUQUE, EL
TORITO, FARMER JOHN, GRINGO PETE’S, FAST ‘N EASY, HERB-OX, HERDEZ, HOMELAND,
HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE, KID’S KITCHEN, LAYOUT, LITTLE SIZZLERS,
LLOYD’S, MANNY’S, MARRAKESH EXPRESS, MARY KITCHEN, MEXICAN ACCENT, NATURAL
CHOICE, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, PATAK’S, PELOPONNESE, PILLOW PACK, RANGE BRAND, ROSA,
SAAG’S, SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, STAGG, SWEET THING, THICK & EASY, VALLEY
FRESH, and WRANGLERS.

The Company’s patents expire after a term that is
typically 20 years from the date of filing, with earlier expiration possible
based on the Company’s decision to pay required maintenance fees.  As long as the Company intends to continue
using its trademarks, they are renewed indefinitely.

Customers and Backlog Orders

During
fiscal year 2006, no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total
Company sales.  The five largest
customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of
segment sales: 49 percent of Grocery Products, 38 percent of Refrigerated
Foods, 35 percent of JOTS, 35 percent of Specialty Foods, and 19 percent of All
Other.  The loss of one or more of the
top customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect on
the results of such segment.  Backlog
orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of
the products.  Orders are accepted and
shipped on a current basis.

Competition

The production and sale of meat and food products in the United States
and internationally are highly competitive. 
The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products, as
well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such
as beef, chicken, and fish.  The Company
believes that its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated Foods
segment in 2006 were Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods, and ConAgra Foods; for its
Grocery Products segment, ConAgra Foods, Pinnacle Foods, and Campbell Soup Co.;
and for JOTS, Cargill, Inc. and Butterball, LLC.

All segments compete on the basis of price, product quality, brand
identification, and customer service. 
Through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the
Company’s strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong
brand recognition, which would then support higher value perceptions from
customers.

The Company competes using this same strategy in international markets
around the world.


Research
and Development

Research and development continues to be a vital part
of the Company’s strategy to extend existing brands and expand into new branded
items.  The expenditures for research and
development for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, were approximately $18,631,000,
$17,585,000, and $15,944,000, respectively. 
There are 55 professional employees engaged in full time research, 26 in
the area of improving existing products and 29 in developing new products.

Employees

As of October 29, 2006, the Company had approximately
18,100 active employees.
