(a)

General Development of Business

Hormel
Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as George A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and
food products and continues in this line of business. The Company name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a
variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States. Although pork and turkey remain the major raw materials for Hormel products, the Company has
emphasized for several years the manufacture and distribution of branded, consumer packaged items rather than the commodity fresh meat business.

The
Company's branding strategy led to the development of a joint venture between Hormel Foods Corporation and Excel Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cargill Incorporated. This joint venture
began marketing and selling nationally branded fresh case ready beef and pork under the existing HORMEL ALWAYS TENDER brand name in fiscal year 2003. This 50 percent owned joint venture, named
Precept Foods LLC, is based in Austin, Minn.

In
fiscal 2001, the Jennie-O Turkey Store (JOTS) business was formed as a result of merging the Company's existing Jennie-O Foods, Inc. business with the operations of
The Turkey Store Company, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. The Turkey Store Company was a turkey processing business headquartered in Barron, Wisconsin. The merged JOTS
operation is currently the largest turkey processor in the world. JOTS markets its turkey products through its own sales force and independent brokers.

The
acquisitions of Diamond Crystal Brands Nutritional Products in fiscal 2001 and the Century Foods International business in July of fiscal 2003 strengthened the Company's presence in the
nutritional food products and supplements market. The Company currently operates as one of the largest companies providing nutritional products to the U.S. healthcare industry.

The
Company acquired the Diamond Crystal Brands business from Imperial Sugar Co. in December of fiscal 2003. Diamond Crystal Brands packages and sells various sugar, sugar substitute, salt and pepper
products, savory products, drink mixes and dessert mixes to retail and foodservice customers.

Internationally,
the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly owned subsidiary. HFIC has a presence in the international marketplace through joint
ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as China, Spain, and the Philippines. HFIC also has a global presence with minority positions in food companies in Spain
(Campofrio Alimentacion S.A., 15% holding) and the Philippines (Purefoods-Hormel, 40% holding).


The
Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all of the assets of the Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business.

The
Company had no significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.

(b)

Industry Segment

The
Company's business is reported in five segments: Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, Specialty Foods, and All Other. The contributions of each segment to net
sales to unaffiliated customers and operating profit, and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment are reported in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Annual Stockholder's Report for the year ended October 25, 2003, incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Description of Business

Products and Distribution

The Company's products primarily consist of meat and other food products. The meat products are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned. The percentages of total
revenues contributed by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the Company are as follows:

Reporting
of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail, foodservice or
international. Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the Company's general-purpose financial statements.

Perishable
meat includes fresh meats, sausages, hams, wieners and bacon (excluding JOTS products.) Nonperishable meat includes canned luncheon meats, shelf stable microwaveable entrees, stews,
chilies, hash, meat spreads and other items that do not require refrigeration as well as frozen processed products. The Poultry category is composed primarily of JOTS products. The Other category
primarily consists of nutritional food products and supplements, sugar and sugar substitutes, salt and pepper products, dessert mixes, food packaging (casings for dry sausage), and industrial gelatin
products. The Other category has increased over the past two years primarily due to the following acquisitions: Century Foods International (July 2003), Diamond Crystal Brands
(December 2002), and Diamond Crystal Brands Nutritional Products (April 2001).

No
new product in fiscal 2003 required a material investment of Company assets.

Domestically,
the Company sells its products in all 50 states. Hormel products are sold through Company sales personnel, operating in assigned territories coordinated from district sales offices
located in most of the larger U.S. cities, as well as independent brokers and distributors. As of October 25, 2003, the Company had approximately 600 sales personnel engaged in selling its
products. Distribution of products to customers is by common carrier.


Through
HFIC, the Company markets its products in various locations throughout the world. Some of the larger markets include Australia, Canada, China, England, Japan, Mexico and Micronesia. The
distribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the China operations own and operate their own delivery system. The Company, through HFIC, has licensed companies to manufacture
various Hormel products internationally on a royalty basis, with the primary licensees being Tulip International of Denmark and CJ Corp. of South Korea.

Raw Materials

The Company has, for the past several years, been concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal
variation experienced with commodity type products. Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products. Although hog producers are moving toward larger, more efficient
year-round confinement operations and supply contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials. The
Company's expanding line of processed items has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

Livestock
slaughtered by the Company is purchased by Company buyers and commission dealers at sale barns and terminal markets or under long-term supply contracts at locations principally
in Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and South Dakota. The cost of livestock and the utilization of the Company's facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork
production in the United States. The hog production industry has been rapidly moving to very large, vertically integrated, year-round confinement operations operating under
long-term supply agreements. This has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market, which decreases the supply of hogs on the open market and can severely diminish the
utilization of slaughter facilities and increase the cost of the raw materials they produce. The Company, along with others in the industry, uses long-term supply contracts to manage the
effects of this trend and to assure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result in costs for live hogs that are
either higher or lower than the spot cash market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Contract costs are fully reflected in the Company's reported financial
results. In fiscal 2003, the Company purchased 79 percent of its hogs under long-term supply contracts.

In
fiscal 2003, JOTS raised approximately 57 percent of the turkeys needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products. Turkeys not sourced within the
Company are contracted with independent turkey growers. JOTS' turkey-raising farms are located throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Production costs in raising turkeys are primarily subject to
fluctuations in feed grain prices and to a lesser extent fuel costs.

Manufacturing

The Company has plants in Austin, Minnesota; Fremont, Nebraska; and Beijing, China that slaughter livestock for processing. Quality Pork Processors of Dallas, Texas, operates
the slaughter facility at Austin under a custom slaughter arrangement.

Facilities
that produce manufactured items are located in Algona, Iowa; Aurora, Illinois; Austin, Minnesota; Beloit, Wisconsin; Bondurant, Iowa; Ft. Dodge, Iowa; Fremont, Nebraska; Houston, Texas;
Knoxville, Iowa; Mitchellville, Iowa; Osceola, Iowa; Perrysburg, Ohio; Quakertown, Pennsylvania; Rochelle, Illinois; Savannah, Georgia; Sparta, Wisconsin; Stockton, California; Tucker, Georgia;
Visalia, California; Wichita, Kansas; Beijing, China; and Shanghai, China. Company products are also custom manufactured by several other companies. The following are the Company's larger custom
manufacturers: Lakeside Packing Company, Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Schroeder Milk, Maplewood, Minnesota; Steuben Foods, Jamaica, New York; Power Packaging, St. Charles, Illinois; Criders, Stilmore,
Georgia; Tony Downs, St. James, Minnesota; and Concept Foods, Alma, Kansas. Power


Logistics, Inc.,
based in St. Charles, Illinois, operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio, and Osceola, Iowa.

The
Company's turkey slaughter and processing operations are located in Barron, Wisconsin; Faribault, Minnesota; Melrose, Minnesota; Montevideo, Minnesota; Pelican Rapids, Minnesota; and Willmar,
Minnesota.

Patents and Trademarks

There are numerous patents and trademarks that are important to the Company's business. The Company holds seven foreign and 47 U.S. issued patents. Some of the trademarks are
registered and some are not. In recognition of the importance of these assets, the Company created a subsidiary, Hormel Foods, LLC, in 1998 to create, own, maintain and protect most of the Company's
trademarks and patents. Some of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used in the Company's segments are:

HORMEL,
ALWAYS TENDER, AMERICAN CLASSICS, AUSTIN BLUES, BLACK LABEL, CARAPELLI, CHI-CHI'S, CURE 81, CUREMASTER, DAN'S PRIZE, DIAMOND CRYSTAL, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DUBUQUE, EL TORITO,
FAST 'N EASY, HERB-OX, HERDEZ, HOMELAND, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE, KID'S KITCHEN, LAYOUT, LITTLE SIZZLERS, MARRAKESH EXPRESS, MARY KITCHEN, OLD SMOKEHOUSE,
PATAK'S, PELOPONNESE, PILLOW PACK, QUICK MEAL, RANGE BRAND, ROSA GRANDE, SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, STAGG, SWEET THING, THICK & EASY and WRANGLERS.

Customers and Backlog Orders

During fiscal year 2003, no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total Company sales. The five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the
following percentage of segment
sales: 39 percent of Grocery Products, 39 percent of Refrigerated Foods, 35 percent of JOTS, 51 percent of Specialty Foods, and 27 percent of All Other. The loss of
one or more of the top customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect on the results of such segment. Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a
large portion of the products. Orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis.

Competition

The production and sale of meat and food products in the United States and internationally are highly competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey
products, as well as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken and fish. The Company believes that its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated
Foods segment in 2003 were Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and ConAgra Foods; for its Grocery Products segment, ConAgra Foods, Dial Corp. and Campbell Soup Co.; and for JOTS, ConAgra Foods and
Cargill, Inc.

All
Hormel segments compete on the basis of price, product quality, brand identification and customer service. Through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Company's
strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition, which would then support higher value perceptions from customers.

The
Company competes using this same strategy in international markets around the world.


Research and Development

Research and development continues to be a vital part of the Company's strategy to extend existing brands and expand into new branded items. The expenditures for research and
development for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were $13,165,000, $12,097,000 and $11,478,000. There are 42 professional employees engaged in full time research, 19 in the area of improving
existing products and 23 in developing new products.

Employees

As of October 25, 2003, the Company had over 16,000 active employees.
