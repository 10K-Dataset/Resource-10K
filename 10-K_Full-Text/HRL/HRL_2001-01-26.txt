HORMEL FOODS CORPORATION

OCTOBER 28, 2000

PART I

Item 1.  BUSINESS

(a)

General Development of Business

Hormel
Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota as George A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor of
meat and food products and continues in this line of business. The Company name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a
variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States. Although pork remains the major raw material for Hormel products, the Company has emphasized for
several years the manufacture and distribution of branded, consumer packaged items rather than the commodity fresh meat business. New product introductions the past few years have emphasized a variety
of branded turkey products produced and sold under the Jennie-O label, the fast growing ethnic food market with Chi-Chi's and Herdez lines of Mexican foods, House of Tsang oriental sauces and food
products, Mediterranean food products under the Marrakesh Express and Peloponnese labels, and the addition of Carrapelli Olive Oil.

The
Company's larger subsidiaries include Jennie-O Foods, Inc., and Hormel Foods International Corporation.

Jennie-O
markets turkey products nationwide through its own sales force and brokers providing the Company with a significant presence in this important category of the industry.

Internationally
the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation. Hormel Foods International has a presence in the international marketplace through
joint ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as China and Spain. Minority investments in food companies in Spain and the Philippines have resulted in an increased
Hormel presence in those areas.

The
Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all of the assets of the Company have been acquired in the
ordinary course of business.

The
Company had no significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.

(b)

Industry Segment

Hormel
Foods Corporation is engaged in a single industry segment "Meat and Food Processing". The meat and food processing industry is very competitive with respect to price, marketing
and customer service. In addition to meat processing firms, the Company competes with consumer packaged food manufacturers as well as seafood, poultry and vegetable protein processors.

(c)

Description of Business (In Thousands of Dollars)

The
principal products of the Company are meat and food products which are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned.

The percentage of total revenues contributed by classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the Company are as follows:

Meat
Products includes fresh meats, sausages, hams, wieners and bacon. Prepared Foods products include canned luncheon meats, shelf stable microwaveable entrees,
stews, chilies, hash, meat spreads and frozen processed products. Jennie-O turkey products are included in the Poultry, Other category.

There
are numerous trademarks and patents which are important to the Company's business. Some of the trademarks are registered and some are not. In recognition of the importance of
these assets, the Company created a subsidiary, Hormel Foods LLC, in 1998 to create, own, maintain and protect trademarks and patents. Some of the more significant trademarks owned or licensed are:
HORMEL, ALWAYS TENDER, AMERICAN CLASSICS, BLACK LABEL, CHI-CHI'S, CURE 81, CUREMASTER, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DUBUQUE, EL TORITO, FAST 'N EASY, HERB-OX, HERDEZ, HOMELAND, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O,
KID'S KITCHEN, LAYOUT, LITTLE SIZZLERS, MARRAKESH EXPRESS, MARY KITCHEN, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, PATAK'S, PELOPONNESE, PILLOW PACK, QUICK MEAL, RANGE BRAND, ROSA GRANDE, SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, STAGG, THICK &
EASY, and WRANGLERS. The Company holds 5 foreign and 32 U. S. patents.

The
Company for the past several years has been concentrating on processed, consumer branded products with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with
commodity type products. Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products. Although live pork producers are moving toward larger, more efficient year-round confinement operations and
supply contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials. The expanding line of processed items has reduced but
not eliminated the sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

On
October 31, 2000 the Company entered into a $425,000 line of credit which replaced an existing credit line of $20,000. At fiscal year end, the Company had various lines of credit
with a maximum available commitment of $37,300 of which $24,000 was unused as of October 28, 2000. A fee is paid for the availability of the credit lines. Long-term debt consists of $87,619 of
unsecured medium-term notes of which $23,333 matures on October 15, 2002, and $64,286 matures on October 15, 2006; $40,620 of medium-term unsecured notes, denominated in Euros used to purchase an
equity ownership in Campofrio Alimentacion, S.A. (Campofrio), Madrid, Spain; $4,700 in small issue Industrial Revenue Bonds of varying maturities; $2,872 of promissory notes with principal and
interest paid annually through 2007 secured by limited partnership interests in the Federal Affordable Housing Program; $20,312 in a medium-term variable rate unsecured note, denominated in Euros,
with principal and interest due annually through 2004, used in the Pure Foods-Hormel investment in the Philippines; $11,377 in medium-term notes with variable rates, principal and interest due
annually through 2006, secured by various equipment in our China operations; $13,300 in variable rate revolving credit debt; and $3,567 in other long-term debt. The notes denominated in Euros provide
a hedge against currency fluctuations in the investment in Campofrio.

Financial
resources and anticipated funds from operations are considered adequate to meet normal operating cash requirements.

The
Company has no customers which would have a significant effect on the Company's business if lost. During fiscal year 2000, no customer accounted for more than 7.5% of sales.
Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products and orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis.

Recognizing the importance of developing, maintaining and protecting its intangible asset base of trademarks, brand and patents, the Company during 1998 moved its research activities
and responsibility for its intangible assets into a subsidiary, Hormel Foods LLC. No new product in 2000 required a material investment of Company assets. Research and development expenditures for
fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, were $9,592, $9,566 and $9,037. There are 35 professional employees engaged in full time research; 17 in the area of improving existing products and 18 in
developing new products.

As
of October 28, 2000, the Company had over 12,200 active employees.

Livestock
slaughtered by the Company is purchased by Company buyers and commission dealers at sale barns, and terminal markets or under long-term supply contracts at locations
principally in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and South Dakota. The level of pork production in the United States has an impact on Hormel's raw material cost as well as facility utilization. The
live pork industry has been rapidly moving to very large, vertically integrated, year-round confinement operations operating under long-term supply agreements.

The
Company uses long-term supply contracts as a means of assuring a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result,
in the short term, in costs for live hogs that are either higher or lower than spot cash market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Contract costs are fully
reflected in the Company's reported financial results.

Products
are sold under the Hormel label in all 50 states. Hormel products are sold by approximately 575 Company sales personnel operating in assigned territories coordinated from
district sales offices located in most of the larger United States cities and by approximately 460 brokers and distributors. Distribution of products to customers is by common carrier.

The
Company has plants in Austin, Minnesota; Fremont, Nebraska; and Rochelle, Illinois that slaughter livestock for processing. The slaughter facility at Austin is operated by Quality
Pork Processors of Dallas, Texas under a custom slaughter arrangement.

Facilities
that produce manufactured items are located in Algona, Iowa; Aurora, Illinois; Austin, Minnesota; Beloit, Wisconsin; Fremont, Nebraska; Houston, Texas; Knoxville, Iowa;
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Osceola, Iowa; Stockton, California; Tucker, Georgia; and Wichita, Kansas. Custom manufacturing for Hormel is performed by several companies including Owatonna Canning
Company, Owatonna, Minnesota; Lakeside Packing Company, Plainview, Minnesota; and Pierre Foods of Claremont, North Carolina. Power Logistics, Inc., operates a distribution center for the Company in
Osceola, Iowa and will operate a distribution center currently under construction in Dayton, Ohio.

Jennie-O
Foods has turkey raising, slaughter and processing operations at various locations within Minnesota. Jennie-O contracts with turkey growers to supplement the turkeys it
raises to meet Company raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products.

Hormel
Foods International Corporation markets the Company's products in international areas including the Philippines, Japan, Mexico, Costa Rica and various European countries. The
Company, through Hormel Foods International, has licensed companies to manufacture SPAM luncheon meat overseas on a royalty basis; principally, Tulip International in Denmark. Hormel Foods
International owns Hormel FSC, Inc., a foreign sales corporation, which engages in export related activities. Hormel B.V., a Dutch holding company, holds the investment in Pure Foods Hormel, Campofrio
and Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
