PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

(a)

General Development of Business

Hormel
Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, as George A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and
food products and continues in this line of business. The Company name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a
variety of meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States. Although pork and turkey remain the major raw materials for Hormel products, the Company has
emphasized for several years the manufacture and distribution of branded, consumer packaged items rather than the commodity fresh meat business. In recent years, the Company's emphasis on branded
products has led to the introduction and growth of ethnic product lines, such as Chi-Chi's and Herdez (Mexican), House of Tsang (Asian), Marrakesh Express and Peloponnese (Mediterranean),
Carapelli Olive Oil (Italian), and Patak's (Indian).

Fiscal
2002 was the first full year of operations for the Company's Jennie-O Turkey Store (JOTS) turkey business. The JOTS operation was created as a result of merging the Company's
existing Jennie-O Foods, Inc. and The Turkey Store Company, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. The Turkey Store Company was a turkey processing business
headquartered in Barron, Wisconsin. The merged JOTS operation is currently the largest turkey processor in the world. JOTS markets its turkey products through its own sales force and independent
brokers.

The
Company strengthened its presence in the nutritionally enhanced food products market with the second quarter fiscal 2001 acquisition of Diamond Crystal Brands Nutritional Products, formerly
headquartered in Savannah, Georgia. The Company currently operates as one of the largest companies in the U.S. nutritionally enhanced food products market.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company exited the food processing equipment business by selling its wholly owned subsidiary, Algona Fabrication and Equipment Co. (AFECO) in Algona,
Iowa.

Internationally,
the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly owned subsidiary. HFIC has a presence in the international marketplace through joint
ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as China, Spain, and the Philippines. HFIC also has a global presence with minority positions in food companies in Spain
(Campofrio Alimentacion S.A., 15% holding) and the Philippines (Purefoods-Hormel, 40% holding).

The
Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all of the assets of the Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business. Financial resources and anticipated funds from operations are considered adequate to meet normal operating cash requirements.

The
Company had no significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.

(b)

Industry Segment

The
Company's business is reported in four segments: Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and All Other. The contributions of each segment to net sales to
unaffiliated customers and operating profit, and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment are reported in Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
in the Management's


Discussion and Analysis of the Annual Stockholder's Report for the year ended October 26, 2002, incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Description of Business

Products and Distribution

The
principal products of the Company are meat and food products, which are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned. The percentages of total revenues contributed by classes of similar
products for the last three fiscal years of the Company are as follows:

Reporting
of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail, foodservice or
international. To more precisely reflect the sales of each category, some reclassification of products has occurred from the October 28, 2000, percentages presented above. This reclassification
caused a shift in revenues from the Nonperishable meat to the Perishable meat category. Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the Company's general-purpose financial
statements.

Perishable
meat includes fresh meats, sausages, hams, wieners and bacon. Nonperishable meat includes canned luncheon meats, shelf stable microwaveable entrees, stews, chilies, hash, meat spreads and
other items that do not require refrigeration as well as frozen processed products. The Poultry category is composed primarily of JOTS products. The Other category primarily consists of nutritionally
enhanced food products, food packaging (casings for dry sausage), industrial gelatin products, and food manufacturing equipment. The food manufacturing equipment business was sold in fiscal 2001. The
Poultry and Other categories have increased over the past two years primarily because of The Turkey Store and Diamond Crystal Brands Nutritional Products acquisitions in the second quarter of fiscal
2001.

No
new product in fiscal 2002 required a material investment of Company assets.

Domestically,
the Company sells its products in all 50 states. Hormel products are sold through Company sales personnel, operating in assigned territories coordinated from district sales offices
located in most of the larger U.S. cities, as well as independent brokers and distributors. As of October 26, 2002, the Company had approximately 600 sales personnel engaged in selling its
products. Distribution of products to customers is by common carrier.

Through
HFIC, the Company markets its products in various locations throughout the world. Some of the larger markets include Australia, Canada, China, England, Japan, Mexico and Micronesia. The


distribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the China operations own and operate their own delivery system. The Company, through HFIC, has licensed companies to manufacture
various Hormel products internationally on a royalty basis, with the primary licensee being Tulip International of Denmark.

Raw Materials

The
Company has, for the past several years, been concentrating on processed branded products for consumers with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with
commodity type products. Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products. Although hog producers are moving toward larger, more efficient year-round confinement
operations and supply contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials. The expanding line of processed items
has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

Livestock
slaughtered by the Company is purchased by Company buyers and commission dealers at sale barns and terminal markets or under long-term supply contracts at locations principally
in Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and South Dakota. The cost of livestock and the utilization of the Company's facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork
production in the United States. The hog production industry has been rapidly moving to very large, vertically integrated, year-round confinement operations operating under
long-term supply agreements. This has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market, which decreases the supply of hogs on the open market and can severely diminish the
utilization of slaughter facilities and increase the cost of the raw materials they produce. The Company, along with others in the industry, uses long-term supply contracts to manage the
effects of this trend and to assure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result in costs for live hogs that are
either higher or lower than the spot cash market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Contract costs are fully reflected in the Company's reported financial
results. In fiscal 2002, the Company purchased 75 percent of its hogs under long-term supply contracts.

In
fiscal 2002, JOTS raised approximately 53 percent of the turkeys needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products. Turkeys not sourced within the
Company are contracted with independent turkey growers. JOTS' turkey-raising farms are located throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Production
costs in raising turkeys are subject to fluctuations in grain prices, particularly corn. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company began hedging its corn needs by purchasing corn
futures contracts. The corn futures contracts offset the fluctuation in the Company's future direct corn purchases.

Manufacturing

The
Company has plants in Austin, Minnesota; Fremont, Nebraska; Beijing, China; and Rochelle, Illinois (Rochelle converted to a 100 percent further processing facility effective
January 6, 2003) that slaughter livestock for processing. Quality Pork Processors of Dallas, Texas, operates the slaughter facility at Austin under a custom slaughter arrangement.


Facilities
that produce manufactured items are located in Algona, Iowa; Aurora, Illinois; Austin, Minnesota; Beloit, Wisconsin; Ft. Dodge, Iowa; Fremont, Nebraska; Houston, Texas; Knoxville, Iowa;
Osceola, Iowa; Quakertown, Pennsylvania; Rochelle, Illinois; Stockton, California; Tucker, Georgia; Wichita, Kansas; Beijing, China; and Shanghai, China. Several companies perform custom manufacturing
for Hormel, including Owatonna Canning Company, Owatonna, Minnesota; Lakeside Packing Company, Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Criders, Stilmore, Georgia; Tony Downs, St. James, Minnesota; and Pierre Foods of
Claremont, North Carolina. Power Logistics, Inc., based in St. Charles, Illinois, operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio, and Osceola, Iowa.

The
Company's turkey slaughter and processing operations are located in Barron, Wisconsin; Faribault, Minnesota; Marshall, Minnesota; Melrose, Minnesota; Montevideo, Minnesota; Pelican Rapids,
Minnesota; and Willmar, Minnesota.

Patents and Trademarks

There
are numerous patents and trademarks that are important to the Company's business. The Company holds five foreign and 40 U.S. issued patents. Some of the trademarks are registered and some are
not. In recognition of the importance of these assets, the Company created a subsidiary, Hormel Foods, LLC, in 1998 to create, own, maintain and protect most of the Company's trademarks and patents.
Some of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used in the Company's segments are:

HORMEL,
ALWAYS TENDER, AMERICAN CLASSICS, AUSTIN BLUES, BLACK LABEL, CARAPELLI, CHI-CHI'S, CURE 81, CUREMASTER, DAN'S PRIZE, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DUBUQUE, EL TORITO, FAST 'N EASY,
HERB-OX, HERDEZ, HOMELAND, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE, KID'S KITCHEN, LAYOUT, LITTLE SIZZLERS, MARRAKESH EXPRESS, MARY KITCHEN, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, PATAK'S, PELOPONNESE,
PILLOW PACK, QUICK MEAL, RANGE BRAND, ROSA GRANDE, SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, STAGG, THICK & EASY and WRANGLERS.

Customers and Backlog Orders

During
fiscal year 2002, no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total Company sales. The five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of
segment sales: 38 percent of Grocery Products, 39 percent of Refrigerated Foods, 33 percent of JOTS and 23 percent of All Other. The Company believes the loss of any single
customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the products and orders are accepted
and shipped on a current basis.

Competition

The
production and sale of meat and food products in the United States and internationally are highly competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products, as well as
national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken and fish. The Company believes that its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated Foods segment in 2002
were Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and ConAgra Foods; for its Grocery Products segment, ConAgra Foods, Dial Corp. and Campbell Soup Co.; and for JOTS, ConAgra Foods and Cargill, Inc.


All
Hormel segments compete on the basis of price, product quality, brand identification and customer service. Through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Company's
strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition, which would then support higher value perceptions from customers.

The
Company competes using this same strategy in international markets around the world.

Research and Development

Research
and development continues to be a vital part of the Company's strategy to extend existing brands and expand into new branded items. The expenditures for research and development for fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, were $12,097,000, $11,478,000 and $9,592,000. There are 40 professional employees engaged in full time research, 18 in the area of improving existing products and 22
in developing new products.

Employees

As
of October 26, 2002, the Company had over 15,500 active employees.
