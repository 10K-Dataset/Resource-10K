PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

(a)

General Development of Business

Hormel
Foods Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was founded by George A. Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota as George A. Hormel & Company. The Company started as a processor of meat and food
products and continues in this line of business. The Company name was changed to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995. The Company is primarily engaged in the production of a variety of
meat and food products and the marketing of those products throughout the United States. Although pork remains the major raw material for Hormel products, the Company has emphasized for several years
the manufacture and distribution of branded, consumer packaged items rather than the commodity fresh meat business. In recent years, the Company's emphasis on branded products has led to the
introduction and growth of the ethnic product lines, such as Chi-Chi's and Herdez (Mexican), House of Tsang (Asian), Marrakesh Express and Peloponnese (Mediterranean), and Carapelli Olive
Oil (Italian).

The
2001 second quarter acquisitions of The Turkey Store Company and Diamond Crystal Brands Nutritional Products (Diamond Crystal) are expected to play an important role in the continued growth of
Hormel Foods Corporation.

The
Turkey Store Company, formerly based in Barron, Wisconsin, has proven thus far to be a good strategic addition to Jennie-O Foods, Inc., Hormel's largest subsidiary. The newly
created Jennie-O
Turkey Store (JOTS) subsidiary markets turkey products nationwide through its own sales force and independent brokers, making the Company one of the largest turkey processors in the U.S. market.

Hormel
Foods Corporation also expanded its nutritionally enhanced food product line with the purchase of Diamond Crystal, formerly headquartered in Savannah, Georgia. This acquisition has greatly
strengthened the Company's presence in this area and has helped make Hormel Foods Corporation one of the largest companies in this market.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company exited the food processing equipment business by selling its wholly owned subsidiary, Algona Fabrication and Equipment Co. (AFECO) in Algona,
Iowa.

Internationally
the Company markets its products through Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly owned subsidiary. HFIC has a presence in the international marketplace through joint
ventures and placement of personnel in strategic foreign locations such as China, Spain, and the Philippines. HFIC has also increased its global presence by obtaining minority positions in food
companies in Spain (Campofrio Alimentacion S.A., 21% holding) and the Philippines (Purefoods-Hormel, 40% holding).

The
Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings during its history. Substantially all of the assets of the Company have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business. Financial resources and anticipated funds from operations are considered adequate to meet normal operating cash requirements.

The
Company had no significant change in the type of products produced or services rendered, nor in the markets or methods of distribution since the beginning of the fiscal year.

(b)

Industry Segment

The
Company's business is reported in four segments: Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and All Other. The contributions of each segment to net sales to
unaffiliated customers and operating profit, and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment are


reported in Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Annual Stockholder's Report for the year ended October 27,
2001, incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

Description of Business

Products and Distribution

The
principal products of the Company are meat and food products which are sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked and canned. The percentages of total revenues contributed by classes of similar
products for the last three fiscal years of the Company are as follows:

Reporting
of revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as the same or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such as retail, foodservice or
international. To more precisely reflect the sales of each category, some reclassification of products has occurred from October 28, 2000, to the current year. This reclassification caused a
shift in revenues from the Nonperishable meat to the Perishable meat category. Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce the Company's general-purpose financial statements.

Perishable
meat includes fresh meats, sausages, hams, wieners and bacon. Nonperishable meat includes canned luncheon meats, shelf stable microwaveable entrees, stews, chilies, hash, meat spreads and
frozen processed products and other items that do not require refrigeration. The Poultry category is composed primarily of Jennie-O Turkey Store products. The Other category primarily
consists of nutritionally enhanced food products, food packaging (casings for dry sausage), industrial gelatin products, and food manufacturing equipment. The food manufacturing equipment business was
sold in fiscal 2001.

No
new product in 2001 required a material investment of Company assets.

Products
are sold under the Hormel label in all 50 states. Hormel products are sold by approximately 550 Company sales personnel operating in assigned territories coordinated from district sales
offices located in most of the larger United States cities and by approximately 425 brokers and distributors. Distribution of products to customers is by common carrier.

Products
with the Jennie-O or The Turkey Store label are also sold in all 50 states. These products are sold by approximately 50 sales personnel and 225 brokers and distributors located
throughout the country. The distribution of products to customers is by common carrier.

Hormel
Foods International Corporation (HFIC) markets the Company's products in various locations throughout the world. Some of the larger markets include Australia, Canada, Central America, China,
England, Japan, Mexico, and Micronesia. The distribution of export sales to customers is by common


carrier while the China operations own and operate their own delivery system. The Company, through HFIC, has licensed companies to manufacture various Hormel products internationally on a royalty
basis, with the primary licensee being Tulip International of Denmark.

Raw Materials

The
Company for the past several years has been concentrating on processed, branded products for consumers with year-round demand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with
commodity type products. Pork continues to be the primary raw material for Company products. Although hog producers are moving toward larger, more efficient year-round confinement
operations and supply contracts are becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply of fresh pork materials. The expanding line of processed items
has reduced but not eliminated the sensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations.

Livestock
slaughtered by the Company is purchased by Company buyers and commission dealers at sale barns and terminal markets or under long-term supply contracts at locations principally
in Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and South Dakota. The cost of livestock and the utilization of the Company's facilities are affected by both the level and the methods of pork
production in the United States. The hog production industry has been rapidly moving to very large, vertically integrated, year-round confinement operations operating under
long-term supply agreements. This has resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market, which decreases the supply of hogs on the open market and can severely diminish the
utilization of slaughter facilities and increase the cost of the raw materials they produce. The Company, along with others in the industry, uses long-term supply contracts to manage the
effects of this trend and to assure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in
costs for live hogs that are either higher or lower than the spot cash market depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Contract costs are fully reflected in the
Company's reported financial results. In fiscal 2001 the company purchased 72% of its hogs under long-term supply contracts.

Jennie-O
Turkey Store raises much of the turkeys needed to meet its raw material requirements for whole bird and processed turkey products. Turkeys not sourced within the Company are
contracted with independent turkey growers. Jennie-O Turkey Store's turkey-raising farms are located throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Manufacturing

The
Company has plants in Austin, Minnesota; Fremont, Nebraska; Rochelle, Illinois; and Beijing, China that slaughter livestock for processing. Quality Pork Processors of Dallas, Texas operates the
slaughter facility at Austin under a custom slaughter arrangement.

Facilities
that produce manufactured items are located in Algona, Iowa; Aurora, Illinois; Austin, Minnesota; Beloit, Wisconsin; Ft. Dodge, Iowa; Fremont, Nebraska; Houston, Texas; Knoxville, Iowa;
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Osceola, Iowa; Quakertown, Pennsylvania; Rochelle, Illinois; Stockton, California; Tucker, Georgia; Wichita, Kansas; Beijing, China; and Shanghai, China. Several companies
perform custom manufacturing for Hormel, including Owatonna Canning Company, Owatonna, Minnesota; Lakeside Packing Company, Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Criders, Stilmore, Georgia; Tony Downs, St. James,
Minnesota; and Pierre Foods of Claremont, North Carolina. Power Logistics, Inc.,


based in St. Charles, Illinois, operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio and Osceola, Iowa.

Turkey
slaughter and processing operations are located in Barron, Wisconsin; Faribault, Minnesota; Golden Valley, Minnesota; Marshall, Minnesota; Melrose, Minnesota; Montevideo, Minnesota; Pelican
Rapids, Minnesota; and Willmar, Minnesota.

Patents and Trademarks

There
are numerous patents and trademarks that are important to the Company's business. The Company holds 3 foreign and 39 U.S. issued patents. Some of the trademarks are registered and some are not.
In recognition of the importance of these assets, the Company created a subsidiary, Hormel Foods, LLC, in 1998 to create, own, maintain and protect most of the Company's trademarks and patents. Some
of the more significant owned or licensed trademarks used in the Company's segments are:

HORMEL,
ALWAYS TENDER, AMERICAN CLASSICS, AUSTIN BLUES, BLACK LABEL, CARAPELLI, CHI-CHI'S, CURE 81, CUREMASTER, DAN'S PRIZE, DI LUSSO, DINTY MOORE, DUBUQUE, EL TORITO, FAST 'N EASY,
HERB-OX, HERDEZ, HOMELAND, HOUSE OF TSANG, JENNIE-O, KID'S KITCHEN, LAYOUT, LITTLE SIZZLERS, MARRAKESH EXPRESS, MARY KITCHEN, MED PASS, OLD SMOKEHOUSE, PATAK'S, PELOPONNESE,
PILLOW PACK, QUICK MEAL, RANGE BRAND, ROSA GRANDE, SANDWICH MAKER, SPAM, STAGG, THICK & EASY, THE TURKEY STORE and WRANGLERS.

Customers and Backlog Orders

During
fiscal year 2001, no customer accounted for more than 10 percent of total company sales. The five largest customers in each segment make up approximately the following percentage of
segment sales: 37 percent of Grocery Products, 33 percent of Refrigerated Foods, 28 percent of Jennie-O Turkey Store, and 24 percent of All Other. The Company
believes the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Backlog orders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion of the
products and orders are accepted and shipped on a current basis.

Competition

The
production of meat and food products in the United States and internationally is highly competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products, as well as national and
regional producers of other meat and protein sources, such as beef, chicken and fish. The Company believes that its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated Foods segment in 2001 were Tyson
Foods, Smithfield Foods and ConAgra Foods; for its Grocery Products segment, ConAgra Foods, Dial Corp. and Campbell Soup Co.; and for Jennie-O Turkey Store, ConAgra Foods and Cargill, Inc.

All
Hormel segments compete on the basis of price, product quality, brand identification and customer service. Through aggressive marketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Company's
strategy is to provide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition, which would then support higher value perceptions from customers.

The
Company competes using this same strategy in international markets around the world.

Research and Development

Research
and development continues to be a vital part of the Company's strategy to extend existing brands and expand into new branded items. The expenditures for research and development for fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, were $11,478,000, $9,592,000 and $9,566,000. There are 37 professional employees engaged in full time research, 17 in the area of improving existing products and 20
in developing new products.

Employees

As
of October 27, 2001, the Company had over 15,600 active employees.
