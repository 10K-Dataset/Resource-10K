Item 1. Business.

OVERVIEW

The
Mosaic Company is one of the world’s leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Through our broad product offering, we are a single source supplier of phosphate- and
potash-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients. We serve customers in more than 40 countries. We mine phosphate rock in Florida and process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida and Louisiana. We mine potash in
Saskatchewan, New Mexico and Michigan. We have other production, blending or distribution operations and equity investments in Brazil, China, India, Argentina, and Chile, and recently made a strategic equity investment in a new phosphate rock mine
in Peru. Our operations include the top four nutrient-consuming countries in the world.

The Mosaic Company is a Delaware corporation that was
incorporated in January 2004 to serve as the parent company of the business that was formed through the business combination of IMC Global Inc. and the fertilizer businesses of Cargill, Incorporated.

As of May 31, 2010, Cargill owned approximately 64.2% of our outstanding common stock. We are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the ticker symbol “MOS” and are headquartered in Plymouth, Minnesota.

We conduct our business through wholly and majority-owned
subsidiaries as well as businesses in which we own less than a majority or a non-controlling interest. We are organized into two reportable business segments: Phosphates and Potash. The following chart shows the respective contributions to fiscal
2010 net sales and operating earnings for each of these business segments and Corporate, Eliminations and Other:

Phosphates Segment

—We are the largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and the largest producer of phosphate-based animal feed
ingredients in the United States. We sell phosphate-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout North America and internationally. Our Phosphates segment also includes our North American and international distribution activities. Our
distribution activities include sales offices, port terminals and warehouses in the United States, Canada, and several other key international countries. In addition, the international distribution activities include blending, bagging and production
facilities in Brazil and a number of other countries. We accounted for approximately 13% of estimated global production and 56% of estimated North American production of phosphate crop nutrients during fiscal 2010.



Potash Segment—

We are the third-largest producer of potash in the world. We sell potash
throughout North America and internationally, principally as fertilizer, but also for use in industrial applications and, to a lesser degree, as animal feed ingredients. We accounted for approximately 12% of estimated global potash production and
38% of estimated North American potash production during fiscal 2010.

Corporate, Eliminations and Other

—Other net sales and
operating earnings in the charts above include sales of nitrogen products and the results of our corporate operations.

Business Developments during Fiscal 2010

During fiscal 2010, a period of significant market uncertainty, we continued to execute against our strategic priorities. At the core of our strategy is
a plan to extend our resource base and invest in the growth of both phosphates and potash. In the Potash segment, we are growing by investing in brownfield expansions. In the Phosphates segment, we are focusing on growing the value of our business
and maintaining our position as one of the lowest cost phosphate producers in the world. Our global distribution network improves the access of our North American production assets to the global markets for our products and helps balance the
seasonality of our business. In fiscal 2010 the steps we took to execute our strategic priorities including the following:

•

We continued the expansion of capacity in our Potash segment, in line with our view of the long-term fundamentals of that business. The planned
expansions over the next several years are expected to increase our annual capacity for finished product by more than five million tonnes. We are positioning our expansion projects so that we are able to bring the additional capacity on line when
market demand warrants.

•

We diversified our phosphate rock sources in alignment with our strategy. In the latter half of fiscal 2010, we entered into an agreement that we
consummated on July 7, 2010 to acquire a 35% economic interest in a joint venture (the “

Miski Mayo Joint Venture

”), with subsidiaries of Vale S.A. and Mitsui & Co., Ltd., that owns a recently completed phosphate
rock mine (the “

Miski Mayo Mine

”) in the Bayovar region of Peru for $385 million. We also entered into a commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase phosphate rock from the Miski Mayo Mine in a volume proportionate to our
economic interest in the joint venture. Phosphate rock production at the Miski Mayo Mine and deliveries to us are expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2011. The Miski Mayo Mine’s expected production capacity is 3.9 million tonnes
per year, once full capacity is reached.



•

On February 11, 2010, we entered into agreements with Vale S.A. and its subsidiaries (“

Vale

”) under which Vale has call
options to purchase from us, and we have put options to sell to Vale, our minority stake in Fertifos Administracão e Participacão S.A. (“

Fertifos

”) and Fertilizantes Fosfatados S.A.
(“

Fosfertil

”), and our Cubatão facility in Brazil. These assets are part of our Phosphates segment. The aggregate sales price for these assets, if the options are exercised, is in excess of $1 billion. The sale is
subject to a number of conditions. We have included additional information about this transaction under “Sale of Fosfertil and Cubatão Facility”.

•

We generated operating cash flow of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2010 and maintained cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion as of May 31, 2010. We
were successful in investing in our business, divesting non-strategic assets and providing a significant cash return to our stockholders. Our strong cash flows allowed us to pay a special dividend of $578.5 million, or $1.30 per share, on
December 3, 2009 in addition to quarterly dividends of $0.05 per share of common stock for each quarter of fiscal 2010.

•

We entered into a new unsecured three-year revolving credit facility of up to $500 million. This facility is available for revolving credit loans,
swing line loans of up to $20 million and letters of credit of up to $200 million. Replacement of our prior credit facility with this new facility reflects the culmination of our efforts to achieve the goal we established at the time of formation of
Mosaic to achieve investment grade credit ratings


and
eliminate a non-investment grade financing and debt covenant structure.

We have included additional information about these
and other developments in our business during fiscal 2010 in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“

Management’s Analysis

”) that is incorporated by reference in
this report in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

After the end of fiscal 2010, on June 30 2010, certain environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the
“

Corps

”) contesting its issuance of a federal wetlands permit for the extension of our South Fort Meade, Florida, phosphate rock mine into Hardee County (the “

Hardee County Extension

”). On July 1,
2010, the court issued a temporary restraining order (“

TRO

”) prohibiting the Corps and us from conducting activities in jurisdictional waters of the United States in reliance on the federal wetlands permit issued by the
Corps. The TRO remains in effect through July 28, 2010 unless modified or extended by the court. The court also held a hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on July 22, 2010. If a preliminary injunction is entered
by the court and mining of the Hardee County Extension is not permitted, we expect that we will need to shut down, in whole or in part, mining activities at the South Fort Meade mine for an indefinite period of time, resulting in layoffs of
employees, significant costs to suspend operations, idle plant costs and possible other impacts on our Phosphates operations. We have included additional information about this lawsuit in our Management’s Analysis and in Note 21 of our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Phosphates Segment

Our

Phosphates

business segment has historically owned and operated mines and production facilities in Florida which produce concentrated
phosphate crop nutrients and phosphate-based animal feed ingredients, and processing plants in Louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients. Our Phosphates segment’s results have also historically included our North American
distribution activities and the results of Phosphate Chemicals Export Association, Inc. (“

PhosChem

”), a U.S. Webb-Pomerene Act association of phosphate producers which exports concentrated phosphate crop nutrient products
around the world for us and PhosChem’s other member.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we implemented an international distribution
strategy that realigned our business segments (the “

Realignment

”) to more clearly reflect our evolving business model. The Realignment consisted of moving from three to two business segments by combining our Offshore segment
with our Phosphates segment. Our former Offshore business was principally an international distributor of crop nutrients. Our Phosphates business segment now includes our North American concentrated phosphate crop nutrient and animal feed
ingredients operations, North American distribution activities, the results of PhosChem, and international distribution activities. The Realignment is intended to further align our strong global distribution resources with our North American
production assets.

U.S. Phosphate Crop Nutrients and Animal Feed Ingredients

We are the largest producer of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients in the world. Our U.S. phosphates
operations have capacity to produce approximately 4.4 million tonnes of phosphoric acid
(“

P


O


”) per year, or about 9% of world capacity and
about 45% of North American capacity. Phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and
animal feed products, and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry. Our U.S. phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 3.6 million tonnes during fiscal 2010 and
accounted for approximately 11% of estimated global production and 46% of estimated North American output during fiscal 2010.

Our
phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are:

•

Diammonium Phosphate (“

DAP

”). DAP is the most widely used high-analysis phosphate crop nutrient worldwide. DAP is produced by
combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia. This initial reaction creates a slurry that is then pumped into a granulation plant where it is reacted with additional ammonia to produce DAP. DAP is a solid granular product.

•

Monoammonium Phosphate (“

MAP

”). MAP is the second most widely used high-analysis phosphate crop nutrient and the fastest
growing phosphate product worldwide. MAP is also produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia. The resulting slurry is then pumped into the granulation plant where it is reacted with additional phosphoric acid to produce MAP.
MAP is a solid granular product, but requires less ammonia and more sulfur than DAP.

MicroEssentials

®

is a value-added ammoniated phosphate product that is enhanced through a patented process that creates very thin platelets of sulfur and other micronutrients, such as zinc, on the granulated product. The patented process incorporates
both the sulfate and elemental forms of sulfur, providing season long availability to crops.

In addition, our Phosphates
segment is one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphate-based animal feed ingredients in the world. Production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our New Wales, Florida facility. We market our feed phosphate primarily
under the leading brand names of Biofos

®

and
Multifos

®

.



Our primary phosphate crop nutrient and feed phosphate production facilities are located in central Florida
and Louisiana. The following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the United States and the locations of each of our active and planned future phosphate mines in Florida:

Annual capacity by plant at May 31, 2010 and production volumes by plant for fiscal 2010 are listed below:

(a)

Our effective capacity to produce processed phosphates has been less than our nominal capacity except to the extent we purchase phosphoric acid.



(b)

Actual operating rates vary from those shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products,
maintenance and turnaround time, accidents, mechanical failure, product mix, and other operating conditions.

The phosphoric
acid produced at Uncle Sam is shipped to Faustina, where it is used to produce DAP and MAP. Our Faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants.

We produced approximately 7.3 million tonnes of phosphate crop nutrients for fiscal 2010 and accounted for roughly 13% of estimated world output and
56% of estimated North American production.

Phosphate Rock

Phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate. Our phosphate rock production totaled approximately
13.3 million tonnes in fiscal 2010 and accounted for approximately 8% of estimated world production and 48% of estimated North American production. We are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock and currently operate five mines
with a combined annual capacity of approximately 16.4 million tonnes. Production of one tonne of DAP requires between 1.6 and 1.7 tonnes of phosphate rock.

All of our phosphate mines and related mining operations are located in central Florida. During fiscal 2010, we operated five active mines: Four Corners,
South Fort Meade, Hookers Prairie, Hopewell and Wingate. We plan to develop two large mines at Ona and at Pine Level to replace mines that will be depleted, as we continue to operate, at various times during the next decade.

The phosphate deposits of Florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphate-bearing province that extends from southern Florida north along
the Atlantic coast into southern Virginia. Our active phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the Bone Valley Member of the Peace River Formation in the Central Florida Phosphate District. The southern portions of the Four Corners
and Wingate mines are in what is referred to as the Undifferentiated Peace River Formation, in which our future Ona and Pine Level mines would also be located. Phosphate mining has been conducted in the Central Florida Phosphate District since the
late 1800’s. The potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a north-south direction and approximately 40 miles in width.

We extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines.” Prior to extracting the ore, the draglines must
first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden. At our Wingate mine, we also utilize dredges to strip the overburden and mine the ore. We then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore goes through
washing, screening, sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands, clays and other foreign materials

.

Prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines, we would need to acquire new
draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and, unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used, construct a beneficiation plant.



The following table shows, for each of our phosphate mines, annual capacity at May 31, 2010 and rock
production volume and grade for the past three fiscal years:

(a)

Actual operating rates vary from those shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products, the
quality of the reserves and the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time, maintenance and turnaround time, accidents, mechanical failure, weather conditions, and other operating conditions.

(b)

Bone Phosphate of Lime (“

BPL

”) is a traditional reference to the amount (by weight percentage) of calcium phosphate contained
in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body. A higher BPL corresponds to a higher percentage of calcium phosphate.

(c)

The percent of P


O


in the above table represents a measure of the phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body. A higher percentage corresponds to a higher percentage of phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body.

(d)

We expect to exhaust the Hopewell mine’s reserves in fiscal 2011.

We also purchase phosphate rock from time to time. The level of our purchases of phosphate rock in the future will depend upon, among other factors, our
phosphate rock mining plans, the status of our permits, our need for additional phosphate rock to allow us to operate our concentrates plants at or near full capacity, the quality and level of impurities in the phosphate rock that we mine, and our
development or acquisition of additional phosphate rock deposits and mines. Depending on product mix and tonnage requirements, our need for purchased phosphate rock could increase in the future in order to meet product specifications, particularly
as we develop our proposed Ona and Pine Level mines. Our recent investment in the Miski Mayo Joint Venture and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock from the Miski Mayo Mine will allow us to reduce our
purchases of phosphate rock from other suppliers, after production begins at the mine.

Reserves

We estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be
economically mined. Proven (measured) reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical, chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices. Our estimates of
probable (indicated) reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves, but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves, although the degree of assurance is high
enough to assume continuity between such sites. Proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing of two sites per 40 acre block. Probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block, but geological data provides a high
degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites.



The following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of May 31, 2010:

(a)

Reserves are in areas that are fully accessible for mining; free of surface or subsurface encumbrance, legal setbacks, wetland preserves and other
legal restrictions that preclude permittable access for mining; believed by us to be permittable; and meet specified minimum physical, economic and chemical criteria related to current mining and production practices.

(b)

Reserve estimates are generally established by our personnel without a third party review. There has been no third party review of reserve estimates
within the last five years, except that in fiscal 2008, we engaged a third party to review the recoverable reserves at our Wingate mine’s Tract 2 pursuant to contractual requirements related to our acquisition of these reserves. The reserve
estimates have been prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“

SEC

”).

(c)

Of the reserves shown, 530.4 million tonnes are proven reserves, while approximately 1.6 million tonnes at Ona and 26.2 million tonnes
at Pine Level are probable reserves.

(d)

Average product BPL ranges from approximately 63% to 69%.

(e)

The reserves shown above reflect a reclassification from the Four Corners mine to the Ona mine of 60.8 million tonnes previously assigned to Four
Corners based on an engineering study completed late in fiscal year 2010.

(f)

Of the tonnes shown at Hookers Prairie, our lease of 1.2 million tonnes requires us to pay royalties of $2.00 per short ton of the reserves that
we mine. In addition, our lease of 1.9 million tonnes requires us to pay royalties of $1.25 per short ton that are generally credited against $250,000 advance royalties that we paid when we entered into the lease.

(g)

We expect to exhaust the Hopewell mine’s reserves in fiscal 2011.

(h)

We acquired Wingate Tract 2, relating to 30.4 million tonnes of the reserves shown for the Wingate mine, in March 2004 pursuant to an agreement
under which we paid the seller approximately $3.4 million in March 2010.

(i)

In connection with the sale in 1994 of certain of the surface rights related to approximately 48.9 million tonnes of the reported Pine Level
reserves, we agreed not to mine such reserves until at least 2014. Our current mining plans do not contemplate mining these reserves until at least that time. In addition, in connection with the purchase in 1996 of approximately 99.1 million
tonnes of the reported Pine Level reserves, we agreed to (i) pay royalties of between $0.50 and $0.90 per ton of rock mined based on future levels of DAP margins, (ii) pay to the seller lost income from the loss of surface use to the
extent we use the property for mining related purposes before January 1, 2015 and (iii) re-convey to the seller the lands which are not scheduled to be mined upon completion of the permitting process and the approval of the Development
Order for the mine.



We generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above, with the only significant
exceptions being further described below:

•

Of the tonnes shown for the Wingate mine, 1.9 million tonnes are under a lease that we have the right to extend through 2014 and for which we have
prepaid substantially all royalties.

•

We hold the reserves referred to in Note (e) to the above table under leases that we have rights to extend to 2015 and 2022, respectively.

•

We own the above-ground assets of the South Fort Meade mine, including the beneficiation plant, rail track and clay settling areas. A limited
partnership, South Ft. Meade Partnership, L.P. (“

SFMP

”), owns all of the mineable acres shown in the table for the South Fort Meade mine.

•

We own 35% of SFMP and financial investors own the remaining 65%. SFMP is included as a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements.

•

We have a long-term mineral lease with SFMP. This lease expires on December 31, 2025 or on the date that we have completed mining and reclamation
obligations associated with the leased property. Lease provisions include royalty payments and a commitment to give mining priority to the South Fort Meade phosphate reserves. We pay the partnership a royalty on each tonne mined and shipped from the
areas that we lease from it. Royalty payments to SFMP total approximately $13 million annually at current shipment rates.

•

Through its arrangements with us, SFMP also earns income from mineral lease payments, agricultural lease payments and interest income, and uses those
proceeds to service debt and pay dividends to its equity owners.

•

The surface rights to approximately 619 acres shown in the table above for the South Fort Meade Mine are owned by SFMP, while the U.S. government owns
the mineral rights beneath. We control the rights to mine these reserves under a mining lease agreement and pay royalties on the tonnage extracted. Royalties on the approved leases equal approximately 5% of the six-month rolling average mining cost
of production when mining these reserves. Under the lease, we paid $0.1 million in royalties to the U.S. government in fiscal 2010.

In light of the long-term nature of our rights to our reserves, we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to
termination or expiration of our rights. Additional information regarding permitting is included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, under “Environmental, Health and Safety Matters—Operating Requirements and Permitting”
in our Management’s Analysis, and under “Phosphate Mine Permitting in Florida” in Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sulfur

We use molten sulfur at
our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid. We purchased approximately 3.2 million long tons of sulfur during fiscal 2010. We purchase most of this sulfur from North
American oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process. Production of one tonne of DAP requires approximately 0.4 long tons of sulfur. We procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it
by truck or rail either direct to our phosphate plants or have it sent to terminals for gathering that are located on the US gulf coast.

We
own and operate sulfur terminals in Houston, Texas and in Tampa, Florida. We own two ocean-going barges and contract for operation of another ocean-going vessel that transport molten sulfur from the Texas terminals to Tampa and then onward by truck
to our Florida phosphate plants. We also own a 50% equity interest in Gulf Sulphur Services Ltd., LLLP (“

Gulf Sulphur Services

”), which is operated by our joint venture partner. Gulf



Sulphur Services has a large sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the Gulf of Mexico, and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our Florida sulfur volume. Gulf Sulphur
Services’ capabilities include melting solid sulfur into the molten form that we use, which permits us to access sources of solid as well as molten sulfur. We further round out our sulfur logistic assets with a large fleet of leased railcars
that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system. Our Louisiana operations are served by truck, rail and barge from nearby refineries.

Although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means, sulfur is an
important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability. Alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve
all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities. Changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business. We
have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our Management’s Analysis.

Ammonia

We use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce both DAP and MAP. We used approximately 1.4 million tonnes of ammonia during fiscal 2010.
Production of one tonne of DAP requires approximately 0.2 tonnes of ammonia.

Our Florida ammonia needs are supplied by offshore producers,
under multi-year and annual contracts. Ammonia for our New Wales and Riverview plants is terminaled through an ammonia facility at Port Sutton, Florida that we lease for a term expiring in 2013, which we may extend for up to five additional years. A
third party operates the Port Sutton ammonia facility pursuant to an agreement that expires in 2013, which we may extend for an unlimited number of additional five year terms, as long as we or the other party is entitled to operate the ammonia
facility. Ammonia for our Bartow plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at Port Sutton, Florida pursuant to an agreement that expires in calendar 2010. Ammonia is transported by pipeline from the
terminals to our production facilities. We have a service agreement with the pipeline provider for Bartow that will expire at the end of calendar 2010.

We produce ammonia at Faustina, Louisiana primarily for our own consumption. Our annual capacity is 500,000 tonnes. From time to time we may sell surplus
ammonia to unrelated parties.

Although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates
facilities by a variety of means, ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing, and alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have
sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities. Changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material
impact on our business. We have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our Management’s Analysis.

Natural Gas

Natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia. At our Faustina facility, ammonia is manufactured on site. The
majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published index-based prices and is sourced from Texas and Louisiana via pipeline interconnected to the Henry Hub. We use over-the-counter swap and option contracts to
forward price portions of future gas purchases. The portions of gas purchases not forward priced are purchased at the index based prices or at domestic spot market prices under short-term contracts. We purchase approximately 17 million MMbtu of
natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at Faustina.

Because our ammonia requirements for our Florida operations are purchased
rather than manufactured on site, we purchase approximately two million MMbtu of natural gas per year in Florida only as a thermal fuel for various production processes.



Florida Land Holdings

We are a significant landowner in the State of Florida, which in the future is expected to return to its historical status as one of the fastest areas of
population growth in the United States. We own land comprising approximately 250,000 acres held in fee simple title in central Florida, and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves. Some of our land
holdings are needed to operate our Phosphates business, while a portion of our land assets, such as reclaimed properties, are not related to our operations. As a general matter, more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than
for phosphate operations each year. Our land assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants, port facilities, phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in Florida. We are currently taking initial
steps as part of a long-term future land use strategy to optimize the value of our land assets.

International Production

Our international operations include production in several key international countries. Our production facilities include plants that
produce up to one million tonnes per year of single superphosphate (“

SSP

”) and granulated SSP crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock. We have agreed to sell one of the SSP production facilities as
described under “Sale of Fosfertil and Cubatão Facility” below.

Sale of Fosfertil and Cubatão Facility

Phosphates operations in Brazil include a 20.1% interest in Fosfertil through a 1.3% direct equity interest in Fosfertil and approximately a
33% equity interest in Fertifos. Fosfertil is a Brazilian publicly traded company and the largest phosphate-based crop nutrient producer in Brazil. Its subsidiary Ultrafertil, S.A., is a significant nitrogen company in Brazil. Fertifos is a holding
company through which several fertilizer companies in Brazil own a 56.7% equity interest in Fosfertil. Our equity in net losses of Fosfertil and Fertifos for fiscal 2010 was $12.1 million.

Phosphates operations in Brazil also include a facility at Cubatão that produces SSP and animal feed ingredients and engages in bagging, blending,
storage and warehouse operations.

On February 10, 2010, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement and Other Covenants (the
“

Share Agreement

”) with Vale. In connection with the Share Agreement:

(i)

We and Vale entered into an Option Agreement (the “

Fosfertil Option Agreement

”) pursuant to which we granted Vale a call option to purchase, and
Vale granted us a put option to sell, (such call and put options being collectively referred to as the “

Fosfertil Options

”) the equity interests in a subsidiary of ours that has been formed to hold our minority equity
interests in Fosfertil and Fertifos; and

(ii)

We and Vale entered into an Option Agreement (the “

Holdings Option Agreement

,” and together with the Share Agreement and the Fosfertil Option
Agreement, the “

Transaction Agreements

”) pursuant to which we granted Vale a call option to purchase, and Vale granted us a put option to sell, (such put and call options being collectively referred to as the
“

Holdings Options

” and together with the Fosfertil Options as the “

Options

”) our equity interests in subsidiaries that we formed to hold our Cubatão facility.

Exercise of the Options is subject to our entering into a definitive stock purchase agreement (the “

Stock Purchase Agreement

”)
with Vale with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Holdings Option Agreement on terms substantially consistent with those set forth in the Holdings Option Agreement and certain other conditions. If either Vale or we exercise their
respective Options, the sale of the Cubatão facility is expected to follow the closing of the sale of our interests in Fosfertil and Fertifos.

Following the exercise of the Options, our Brazilian operations are expected to continue their fertilizer and animal feed ingredient blending and
distribution operations in Brazil, as well as their production of SSP and port activities at the Paranagua, Brazil complex of Fospar S.A., a 62.1% owned subsidiary (“

Fospar

”). Accordingly,



in order to facilitate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, we have segregated our ownership of the Fosfertil and Fertifos stock and the Cubatão facility into
separate subsidiaries. We anticipate that securing the necessary permits and completing other steps that we intend to take prior to the sale of our interests in Fosfertil and Fertifos and the Cubatão facility will be completed in the latter
half of calendar 2010.

Under the Transaction Agreements, in general and subject to certain exceptions:

(i)

Vale has agreed to a standstill agreement under which neither it nor its subsidiaries will purchase any phosphate rock, phosphoric acid or phosphate fertilizer or
animal feed ingredient mining or production assets in North America for a period of eighteen months;

(ii)

Vale has agreed that neither it nor its subsidiaries will engage in production/distribution or sale in Brazil of physically blended mineral fertilizers for a period of
three years after the closing (the “

Fosfertil Option Closing

”) of the transactions contemplated by the Fosfertil Option Agreement;

(iii)

We have agreed that we will not engage in the phosphate mining business in Brazil for a period of three years after the Fosfertil Option Closing;

(iv)

The parties have entered into certain agreements providing, as a condition precedent to the Fosfertil Option Closing, for the termination of certain ongoing legal
proceedings brought by Mosaic Brazil against Fosfertil, Fertifos and certain members of Bunge Group. These legal proceedings are described further under “Fosfertil Merger Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3, “

Legal
Proceedings”

in this report;

(v)

Mosaic and Vale S.A. have guaranteed the obligations of their respective subsidiaries; and

(vi)

The parties have also entered into certain other commercial arrangements with respect to Fosfertil’s and the Cubatão facility’s potential continued
supply of certain products and services to us.

The aggregate purchase price for Mosaic’s stakes in Fosfertil and Fertifos
and the Cubatão facility is in excess of $1 billion.

Potash Segment

We are one of the leading potash producers in the world. We mine and process potash in Canada and the United States and sell potash
in North America and internationally. The term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium. Muriate of potash (“

MOP

”) is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry. Red MOP has
traces of iron oxide. The granular and standard grade Red MOP products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending. White MOP has a higher percent
K


O. White MOP, besides being well suited for the
agricultural market, is used in many industrial applications.

Our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers,
distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacture of mixed crop nutrients and, to a lesser extent, in animal feed ingredients. We also sell potash to customers for industrial use. In addition, our potash products are used for de-icing
and as a water softener regenerant.

We operate three potash mines in Canada, including two shaft mines with a total of three production
shafts and one solution mine, as well as two potash mines in the United States, including one shaft mine and one solution mine. We also own related refineries at each of the mines.



The map below shows the location of each of our potash mines.

Our current potash annualized proven peaking capacity, excluding tonnage produced at Esterhazy for a third party pursuant
to a contract described below, totals 10.4 million tonnes of product per year and accounted for approximately 14% of world capacity and 37% of North American capacity. Production during fiscal 2010, excluding tonnage produced for a third party
at Esterhazy, totaled 5.2 million tonnes and accounted for approximately 12% of estimated world production and 38% of estimated North American production.



The following table shows, for each of our potash mines, capacity at May 31, 2010 and volume of mined
ore, average grade and finished product output for the past three fiscal years:

We toll produce MOP at our Esterhazy mine for a third party under a contract discussed below under “Canadian Mines.”

Canadian Mines

We operate three
Canadian potash facilities all located in the southern half of the Province of Saskatchewan, including our solution mine at Belle Plaine, two interconnected mine shafts at our Esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at Colonsay.

Extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the Province of Saskatchewan. The potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt
formation known as the Prairie Evaporites. The Prairie Evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds. Three potash deposits of economic importance occur in Saskatchewan: the Esterhazy, Belle Plaine and Patience
Lake members. The Patience Lake member is mined at Colonsay, and the Esterhazy member at Esterhazy. At Belle Plaine all three members are mined. Each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades. The
particular beds mined at Colonsay and Esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet, respectively. At Belle Plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined.



Our potash mines in Canada produce MOP exclusively. Esterhazy and Colonsay utilize shaft mining while Belle
Plaine utilizes solution mining technology. Traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 3,000 feet where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts. The ore is then crushed, moved to
storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground. In contrast, our solution mining process involves heated water, which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 5,400 feet. A
cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore by a portable, all-weather, electric drilling rig. A separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow. The solution containing dissolved potash and salt is
pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride, a co-product of this process, is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques. Concurrently, the solution is pumped into a 150 acre cooling pond where additional
crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge. Refined potash is dewatered, dried and sized. Our Canadian operations produce 15 different MOP products, including industrial grades, many through proprietary
processes.

Under a contract (the “

PCS Tolling Contract

”) with Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.
(“

PCS

”), we mine and refine the customer’s potash reserves at our Esterhazy mine for a fee plus a pro rata share of operating and capital costs. The contract provides that PCS may elect to receive between
0.45 million and 1.3 million tonnes of potash per year. The contract provides for a term through December 31, 2011 as well as certain renewal terms at the option of PCS, but only to the extent PCS has not received all of its available
reserves under the contract. Based on our then-current calculations, in May 2009, we informed PCS that we believed that approximately 1.5 million tonnes of potash remained to be delivered to PCS under the contract after April 30,2009. PCS
has filed a lawsuit against us contesting our basis and timing for termination of the contract and alleging damages based on our historical mining practices. We subsequently counterclaimed, alleging that PCS breached the PCS Tolling Contract by
refusing to take delivery of approximately 0.9 million tonnes of potash that it ordered under the contract, primarily for delivery after April 30, 2009, due to the global financial and credit crisis. We believe the allegations in PCS’
lawsuit are without merit. We have included a further description of the lawsuit under “Esterhazy Potash Mine Tolling Contract Disputes” in Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. After expiration of the contract or during
other periods to the extent we are not fully utilizing the capacity to satisfy our obligations under the contract, the productive capacity at our Esterhazy mine otherwise used to satisfy our obligations under the contract is available to us for
sales to any of our customers at then-current market prices.

Our potash mineral rights in the Province of Saskatchewan consist of the
following:

We believe that our mineral rights in Saskatchewan are sufficient to
support current operations for more than a century. Leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms, generally 21 years each, except that certain of the acres shown above as “Leased from others” are leased under long-term
leases with terms (including renewals at our option) that expire from 2094 to 2142.

We pay Canadian resource taxes consisting of the Potash
Production Tax and capital taxes. The Potash Production Tax is a Saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax. We also pay the greater of (i) a capital tax on the paid-up capital of our
subsidiaries that own and operate our Saskatchewan potash mines or (ii) a percentage of the value of resource sales from our Saskatchewan mines and we pay capital tax in other Canadian provinces. In addition to the Canadian resource taxes,
royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash. We have included a further discussion of the Canadian resource taxes and royalties in our Management’s Analysis.



Since December 1985, we have experienced an inflow of salt saturated brine into our Esterhazy mine. At
various times since then, we have experienced new or substantially increased brine inflows at the Esterhazy mine. As a result of these brine inflows, we incur expenditures, certain of which have been capitalized while others have been charged to
expense, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“

U.S. GAAP

”), to control the inflow. It is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at Esterhazy may further increase in
the future and that such an increase could be material, or, in the extreme scenario, that the brine inflows, risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine. See
“Potash Net Sales and Gross Margin” in our Management’s Analysis and “Accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities, interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for
significant safety or other expenditures” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this report, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of costs, risks and other information relating to the brine
inflows.

Due to the ongoing brine inflow problem at Esterhazy, underground operations at this facility are currently not insurable for water
incursion problems. Like other potash producers’ shaft mines, our Colonsay, Saskatchewan, and Carlsbad, New Mexico, mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations, but water inflow risks at
these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles, retentions and limits negotiated with our insurers.

We have a long
term potash capacity expansion plan in Saskatchewan, Canada in response to expected growth in global potash demand. We expect the total planned expansions to increase our annualized proven peaking capacity for finished product by more than
five million tonnes. The expansions are projected to occur over the next decade, with the first expansion production expected to come on line in calendar 2010. We have included a further discussion of our potash capacity expansion plan in our
Management’s Analysis.

United States Mines

In the United States, we have two potash facilities, including a shaft mine located in Carlsbad, New Mexico and a solution mine located in Hersey,
Michigan.

Our potash mineral rights in the United States consist of the following:

The Carlsbad ore reserves are of two types: (1) sylvinite, a
mixture of potassium chloride and sodium chloride that is the same as the ore mined in Saskatchewan, and (2) langbeinite, a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium. These two types of potash reserves occur in a predominantly rock salt
formation known as the Salado Formation. The McNutt Member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance, of which we currently mine two. The McNutt Member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite, polyhalite,
potassium salts, clay, and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone.

Continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore.
Drum type mining machines are used to cut the sylvinite and langbeinite ores from the face. Mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors, transported to storage areas, and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery.

Two types of potash are produced at the Carlsbad refinery. MOP is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry.
Double sulfate of potash magnesia is the second type of potash, which we market under our brand name K-Mag

®

, and
contains sulfur, potassium and magnesium, with low levels of chloride.



At the Carlsbad facility, we mine and refine potash from 73,781 acres of mineral rights.
We control these reserves pursuant to either (i) leases from the U.S. government that, in general, continue in effect at our option (subject to readjustment by the U.S. government every 20 years) or (ii) leases from the State of New Mexico
that continue as long as we continue to produce from them. These reserves contain an estimated total of 294 million tonnes of potash mineralization (calculated after estimated extraction losses) in two mining beds evaluated at thicknesses
ranging from 4.5 feet to in excess of 11 feet. At average refinery rates, these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 16 million tonnes of concentrates from sylvinite with an average grade of approximately 60%
K


O and 28 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates
with an average grade of approximately 22% K


O. At projected
rates of production, we estimate that Carlsbad’s reserves of sylvinite and langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for more than 32 years and 25 years, respectively. During fiscal 2010, we increased the reserves at our Carlsbad
facility by 180 million tonnes because we entered into leases that provided access to mineral rights that were previously not economical to mine, and because increased potash selling prices made areas of lower grade ore economical to mine.

At Hersey, Michigan, we operate a solution mining facility which produces salt and potash. Mining occurs in the Michigan Basin in a
predominantly rock salt formation called the Salina Group Evaporite. This formation is a clean salt deposit with interlayered beds of sylvinite and carbonate. At the Hersey facility, our mineral rights consist of 581 acres owned in fee and 1,799
acres controlled under leases that, in general, continue in effect at our option as long as we continue our operations at Hersey. These lands contain an estimated 40 million tonnes of potash mineralization contained in two beds ranging in
thickness from 14 to 30 feet.

Royalties for the U.S. operations amounted to approximately $9.6 million for fiscal 2010. These royalties are
established by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, in the case of the Carlsbad leases from the U.S. government, and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases, in the case of the Carlsbad state leases and the Hersey
leases.

Reserves

Our estimates below of our potash reserves and non-reserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data, seismic data and actual mining
results over more than 35 years. Proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a half-mile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration
core hole. Probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole. Historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to
both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves. We believe that all reserves and non-reserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations.



Our estimated recoverable potash reserves and non-reserve potash mineralization as of May 31, 2010 for
each of our mines is as follows:

(a)

There has been no third party review of reserve estimates within the last four years. The reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with the
standards set forth in Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the SEC.

(b)

Includes both proven and probable reserves.

(c)

The non-reserve potash mineralization reported in the table in some cases extends to the boundaries of the mineral rights we own or lease. Such
boundaries are up to 16 miles from the closest existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole. Based on available geologic data, the non-reserve potash mineralization represents potash that we expect to mine in the future, but it may not meet
all of the technical requirements for categorization as proven or probable reserves under Industry Guide 7.

As discussed
more fully above, we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option, or are long-term leases. Accordingly, we expect to be able to mine
all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases.

Natural Gas

Natural gas is used at our potash solution mines as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products. The steam is used to generate electricity, in
evaporation and crystallization processes and to provide thermal heat to the solution mining process. Our two solution mines accounted for approximately 76% of our Potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production in fiscal
2010. At our shaft mines, natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products. Combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines approximated 12 million MMbtu for fiscal
2010. We purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index price-based physical contracts and on short term spot-priced physical contracts. Our Canadian operations purchase all of their physical gas in Saskatchewan via the TransGas
pipeline system using AECO price indices as pricing references. The U.S. potash operations in Michigan and New Mexico purchase physical gas in their respective regional markets via the MichCon and El Paso Permian Basin market hubs as pricing
references, respectively. We use financial derivative contracts to manage the price of portions of our future purchases.



SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES

United States and Canada

We
have a United States and Canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments. We sell to wholesale distributors, retail chains, cooperatives, independent retailers and national accounts.

Customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed
ingredients businesses. In addition to our production facilities, to service the needs of our customers, we own, lease or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the
Mississippi and Ohio Rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the United States and Canada. From these facilities, we market Mosaic produced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the
distribution channel or directly to farmers in the United States and Canada.

We own port facilities in Savage, Minnesota as well as warehouse
distribution facilities in Pekin, Illinois, Louisville, Kentucky, Hendersonville, Kentucky, Melbourne, Kentucky and Houston, Texas which has a deep water berth providing access to the Gulf of Mexico.

In addition to the geographically situated facilities that we own, our U.S. distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual
throughput agreements in other key geographical areas such as California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and Texas.

Our Canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts. We also lease and own warehouse facilities in Saskatchewan, Canada.

International

Outside of the
United States and Canada, we market our Phosphates segment’s products through PhosChem, as well as our Phosphates segment’s own international distribution activities. During fiscal 2010, PhosChem marketed approximately 77% of our phosphate
export sales volume. We administer PhosChem on behalf of PhosChem’s member companies. We estimate that PhosChem’s sales represent approximately 66% of total U.S. export volume of concentrated phosphates. The countries that account for the
largest amount of PhosChem’s sales of concentrated phosphates include India, Australia, Japan, Brazil and Colombia. During fiscal 2010, PhosChem’s dry concentrated phosphates exports to Asia were 64% of total dry shipments by volume, with
India representing 51% of PhosChem’s total dry concentrated phosphates export shipments.

Our sales outside of the United States and
Canada of Saskatchewan potash products are made through Canpotex Limited (“

Canpotex

”). Canpotex is an export association of certain Canadian potash producers. Canpotex sales are generally allocated among the producer members
based on production capacity. We currently supply approximately 37.1%, by volume, of Canpotex’s requirements. Our potash exports from Carlsbad are sold through our own sales force. We also market our Potash segment’s products through our
Phosphates segment, which acquires its potash primarily through Canpotex. The largest amount of international potash sales are to China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Australia and Latin America.

Our Phosphates segment also purchases phosphates, potash and nitrogen products from, or markets these products for, unrelated third parties.

To service the needs of our customers, our international distribution activities include a network of strategically located sales offices, crop nutrient
blending and bagging facilities, port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate in key geographic areas throughout several countries. The blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blended crop nutrients
(“

Blends

”) from phosphate, potash and nitrogen. The



average product mix in our Blends (by volume) contains approximately 50% phosphate, 25% potash and 25% nitrogen, although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors. Our international
operations serve primarily as a sales outlet for our North American Phosphates production, both for resale and as an input for Blends, and we expect to expand this role in the future. Our Potash segment also has historically furnished a portion of
the raw materials needs for the production of Blends, and is expected to continue to do so in the future.

The following maps show the
locations of our primary distribution operations in South America and Asia:

Other Products

With a strong brand position in a multi-billion dollar animal feed ingredients global market, our Phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for
poultry and livestock to customers in North America, Latin America and Asia. Our potash sales to non-agricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry. Additionally, we sell potash for de-icing and as a
water softener regenerant.

COMPETITION

Because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources, crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered
price. Other competitive factors include product quality, cost and availability of raw materials, customer service, plant efficiency and availability of product. As a result, markets for our products are highly competitive. We compete with a broad
range of domestic and international producers, including farmer cooperatives, subsidiaries of larger companies, and independent crop nutrient companies. Foreign competitors often have access to cheaper raw materials, are required to comply with less
stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and, as a result, may have cost advantages over North American companies. We believe that our extensive North American and international production and distribution system
provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale and transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence.

Unlike many of our competitors, we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate- and potash-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients,
whether produced by us or by other third parties, around the globe. In North America, we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients,



including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions. We also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally, including in the key growth markets of Latin America and
Asia, with port terminals, warehouses, and blending plants in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, China, and India. Our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in more than 40 countries.

Phosphates Segment

Our Phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market. Among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are
domestic and foreign companies, as well as foreign government-supported producers in Asia and North Africa. Phosphate producers compete primarily based on price and, to a lesser extent, product quality, service and innovation, such as our
MicroEssentials

®

product. Major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the United States, Europe
and China. Many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world. Many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market.

We believe that we are a low cost producer of phosphate-based crop nutrients, due in part to our scale, vertical integration and strategic
network of production and distribution facilities. As the world’s largest producer of concentrated phosphates, as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the United States, we maintain an advantage
over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit. We are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs, phosphate rock, to our phosphate production facilities. We believe that our
position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are non-integrated phosphate producers. We produce ammonia at our Faustina concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet
approximately one quarter of our total ammonia needs. With no captive ammonia production in Florida, we are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia from world markets. With our own sulfur transportation barges and our 50%
ownership interest in Gulf Sulphur Services, we are also well-positioned to source an adequate, flexible and cost-effective supply of sulfur, our third key input. We believe that our investments in sulfur infrastructure provide us with a significant
competitive advantage in both cost and access to sulfur.

With production facilities in both central Florida near the Port of Tampa and in
Louisiana on the Mississippi River, we are logistically positioned to supply both domestic and international customers as well as transport rock, sulfur and ammonia easily. In addition, those multiple production points afford us the flexibility to
optimally balance supply and demand.

We have a strong brand in several of the countries in which we have international distribution
activities. In addition to having access to our own production, our international distribution activities have the capability to supply all three types of crop nutrients to our dealer/farmer customer base. Our presence in Latin America and Asia
allows us to capitalize on the growth in nutrient demand in these large and growing international regions. In addition, our relationships with Cargill’s agricultural operations provide our international distribution activities with additional
sales opportunities.

We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations in Florida and Louisiana that are often more stringent than
those to which producers in other countries are subject.

Potash Segment

Potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and, consequently, the market is highly competitive. Through our
participation in Canpotex, we compete outside of North America with various independent potash producers and consortia as well as other export organizations, including state-owned organizations. We also ship product from Carlsbad, New Mexico, potash
facility to our South American distribution centers. Our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing, and offering consistent, high-quality products and superior service. We believe that our potash
cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we achieve the expected increases in production from our planned expansions.



FACTORS AFFECTING DEMAND

Our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced
significant downward and upward swings in operating results. Revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by, among other factors: crop failure; changes in agricultural production practices; worldwide
economic conditions, including the increasing world population, household incomes, and demand for more protein rich food, particularly in developing regions such as China, India, and Latin America, increasing demand for biofuels, and variability in
commodity pricing; governmental policies; the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels; customer expectations about farmer economics, future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs, among other matters;
market trends in raw material costs; market prices for crop nutrients; and weather. Furthermore, our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop
nutrient products during the spring and fall. The international scope of our business, spanning the northern and southern hemispheres, reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business. The degree of seasonality of our business can change
significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons.

We sell products throughout the world. Unfavorable changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting
trade; unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties; strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the United States may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales
trends in the United States.

Our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies, which can affect farmer
economics.

OTHER MATTERS

Employees

We had approximately
7,500 employees as of May 31, 2010, consisting of approximately 3,000 salaried and 4,500 hourly employees.

Labor Relations

As of May 31, 2010:

•

We had nine collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 72% of our hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada. Of these employees,
approximately 35% are covered under collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in fiscal 2011.

•

Agreements with eight unions covered all employees in Brazil, representing 68% of our international employees. More than one agreement may govern our
relations with each of these unions. In general, the agreements are renewable on an annual basis.

•

We also had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in several other countries.

Failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse affect on our operations.
However, we have not experienced a significant work stoppage in many years and consider our labor relations to be good.

Our executive officers are generally elected to serve until their respective successors are elected and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. No “family relationships,” as that term is defined in Item 401(d) of Regulation S-K, exist among any of the listed officers.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described
below. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the
agricultural industry where we or our customers operate. These factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability.

Our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, which we
cannot control. The agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors. The most important of these factors, for U.S. markets, are:

•

weather patterns and field conditions (particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients consumption);

•

quantities of crop nutrients imported to and exported from North America;

•

current and projected grain inventories and prices, which are heavily influenced by U.S. exports and world-wide grain markets; and

•

U.S. governmental policies, including farm and biofuel policies, which may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the level of
grain inventories, the mix of crops planted or crop prices.



International market conditions, which are also outside of our control, may also significantly influence our
operating results. The international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or
changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets, changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the United
States affecting foreign trade and investment.

Our most important products are global commodities, and we face intense global competition
from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes.

Our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop
nutrients, including diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP, and muriate of potash, or MOP. We sell most of our DAP, MAP and MOP in the form of global commodities. Our sales of these products face intense global competition
from other crop nutrient producers.

Changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly
affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell, and are likely to continue to do so in the future.

Competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong, and to focus on sales
into regions where their returns are highest. Increases in the global supply of DAP, MAP and MOP or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes.

Competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have announced plans to expand capacity
over the next several years. The extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions, changes in global or local economic and financial conditions, or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these projects, or
result in the acceleration of existing or new projects, is unclear. In addition, the level of exports by producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in China depends to a significant extent on Chinese government actions to curb exports
through, among other measures, prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production.

We cannot accurately predict when or whether competitors’ capacity expansions will be completed, the impact of future decisions by the Chinese
government on the level of Chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients, or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we are able to sell.

Our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand, which may
cause our results of operations to fluctuate.

Historically, the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical, and prices and demand for
our products have fluctuated to a significant extent, particularly for phosphates and, to a lesser extent, potash. Periods of high demand, increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased
production. This growth increases supply until the market is over-saturated, leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats.

As a result, crop nutrient prices and volumes have been volatile. This price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and
potentially deteriorate. The price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. In contrast, high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices, thus impacting our sales volumes.



Due to reduced market demand, depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors, we and our
predecessors have at various times suspended or reduced production at some of our facilities. The extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations, as we will incur costs for any
temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tends to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales.

Variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets.

Farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients. Farmers’ decisions about the application rate
for each crop nutrient, or to forego application of a crop nutrient, particularly phosphate and potash, vary from year to year depending on a number of factors, including among others, crop prices, crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the
level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest. Farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high, crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the
level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low. Conversely, farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively
high. This variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes.

Our crop nutrient business is seasonal, which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital, and
our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages.

The crop
nutrient business is seasonal. Farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods, the strongest one in the Spring before planting and the other in the Fall after harvest. As a result, the strongest demand for our products
typically occurs during the Spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the Fall harvest. In contrast, we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year. As a result, we and/or our
customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. The seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales
typically being the highest during the North American Spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the Spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year
to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

If seasonal demand exceeds our projections, we will
not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors, which would negatively impact our profitability. If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and
liquidity requirements.

The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the
agricultural industry and other factors.

The distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of
inventories. Significant levels of inventories in the distribution channels for crop nutrients can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices.

In order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers’ seasonal use of crop nutrients, crop nutrient distribution
channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories. The build-up of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive, particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient
industry. When there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel, our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted, even during periods in which farmers’ use of crop nutrients may remain strong.

For example, a build-up of concentrated phosphates and potash in the distribution channels was one of several significant factors that led to softening
selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and weakened sales volumes for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash in our fiscal year ended May 31, 2009.



Changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices.

The cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients. As a result, changes in transportation costs
or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices.

Customer expectations about future events can have a
significant effect on the demand for our products. These expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices.

Customer expectations about future events has had and is expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients. The future
events that may be affected by customer expectations include, among others:

•

Customer expectations about future crop nutrient prices and availability.

Customer expectations about selling prices and availability of crop nutrients has had and is expected to continue to have an effect on
the demand for crop nutrients. When customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient selling prices, customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases. This can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices
for our products. Conversely, customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease, adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices. Customer expectations about
availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices.

For example, during portions of fiscal
2009, our customers anticipated a decline in the market price of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients because of falling global prices for sulfur and ammonia, two of the key raw materials used in the production of concentrated phosphates. Our
customers’ expectation of falling prices was one of several significant factors that led to weak sales volumes and softening selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during portions of fiscal 2009.

•

Customer expectations about future farmer economics.

Similarly, customer expectations about future farmer economics has had and is expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for
crop nutrients. When customers anticipate improving farmer economics, customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices. This can result in a lag in our realization of rising market
prices for our products. Conversely, when customers anticipate declining farmer economics, customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients, adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices.

For example, a plunge in market prices for grains and oilseeds since peaks in June 2008 led customers to expect declining farmer
economics. The expectation of declining farmer economics was one of several significant factors that led to softening selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and weak sales volumes for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and
potash during portions of fiscal 2009.

•

Changes in customer expectations about transportation costs.

As more fully discussed above, increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers’ and farmers’ costs for crop
nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales. Expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases. As a result, changes
in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices.



We conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution
facilities. Any disruption at one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business. The risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities.

We conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities. These large facilities include our phosphate mines and
concentrates plants, our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we conduct our business. Any disruption of operations at one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our
ability to distribute our products. Operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures, decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases
the impact on our operating results from any disruption. We maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance policies, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. We are subject to
various self-retentions and deductibles under these insurance policies. As a result of market conditions, our premiums, self-retentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may
become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. In addition, significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce, or possibly eliminate, coverage. As a result, a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.

Important raw materials and energy used in our
businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing. Changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses.

Natural gas, ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products. Natural gas is used as both a chemical
feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia, which is a raw material used in the production of DAP and MAP. Natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process. From time to time, our profitability has
been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs. Because our products are commodity-like, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our
customers. A significant increase in the price of natural gas, ammonia, sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material impact on our business.

During periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices, we may experience a lag in realizing the
benefits of the falling raw materials prices. This lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.

During some periods,
changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients. In particular, the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the
market prices for sulfur, ammonia, phosphate rock and/or phosphoric acid raw materials. Increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients, and decreasing
market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients. When the market prices for these raw materials plunge rapidly, the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop
nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices. As a result, our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products.
Until we are able to consume the higher priced raw materials, our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected.



During periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices, we
could be required to write down the value of our inventories. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets.

We carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market. In periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly in response to falling
market prices for raw materials, it is possible that we could be required to write down the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our
assets. Any such effect could be material.

For example, in our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2008, we recorded lower of cost or
market inventory write-downs principally in our Phosphates segment. These lower of cost or market inventory write-downs, which totaled $293.5 million, were necessary because the carrying cost of certain ending inventories exceeded our estimates of
future selling prices less reasonably predictable selling costs.

Our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase
commitments we have from our customers. As a result, defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices
and require additional inventory write-downs.

In the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities for raw
materials, alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities.

In the event of a disruption of existing transportation or terminaling facilities for raw materials, alternative transportation and terminaling
facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities.

An extended interruption in the supply of natural gas,
ammonia or sulfur to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign
countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries. Some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the United States to our stockholders, or to utilize cash generated by
our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes.

For fiscal 2010, we derived approximately 65% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to
numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:

•

difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory environments;

•

increased government ownership and regulation of the economy in the countries we serve;

•

political and economic instability, including the possibility for civil unrest, inflation and adverse economic conditions resulting from governmental
attempts to reduce inflation, such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls;

•

nationalization of properties by foreign governments;



•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls, trade barriers or other restrictions; and

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar.

The occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or limit our ability
to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the United States.

In addition, tax regulations, currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to:

•

distribute cash generated by our operations outside the United States to our stockholders, or

•

utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other
corporate purposes.

Our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions, which could subject us
and our assets to significant risks.

We are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the United States and Canada.
Our operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, China and India are a fundamental part of our business. Volatile economic, political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations,
operating results and financial condition.

Adverse weather conditions, including the impact of potential hurricanes and excess rainfall,
have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our operations, particularly our Phosphates business, and result in increased costs, decreased production and potential liabilities.

Adverse weather conditions, including the impact of potential hurricanes and excess rainfall, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our
operations, particularly our Phosphates business. In the past, hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in Florida and Louisiana. In addition, a release of phosphoric acid process wastewater at our Riverview, Florida
facility during a hurricane resulted in a small civil fine, as well as a private class action lawsuit and claims for natural resource damages by governmental agencies.

More significantly, water treatment costs, particularly at our Florida operations, due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following
excess rainfall from hurricanes and other adverse weather. Some of our Florida facilities have high water levels that may, from time to time, require treatment. The high water balances at phosphate facilities in Florida also led the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection to adopt new rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems.

If additional excess rainfall or hurricanes continue to occur in coming years, our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage
process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition.

Adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain. For example, following Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana in
2005, oil refineries that supply sulfur to us were closed and incoming shipments of ammonia were delayed, disrupting production at our Louisiana facilities.



Our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities.
Denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations.

We hold numerous governmental environmental, mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a
government agency to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility.

Expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. Over the next several years, we
and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of our anticipated Florida mining operations at certain of our properties.

A denial of, or delay in issuing, these permits, the issuance of permits with cost-prohibitive conditions, legal actions that prevent us from relying on
permits or revocation of permits, could prevent us from mining at these properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

For example:

•

In Florida, local community participation has become an important factor in the permitting process for mining companies, and various local counties and
other parties in Florida have in the past and continue to file lawsuits challenging the issuance of some of the permits we require. In fiscal 2009 environmental groups for the first time filed a lawsuit in federal court against the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers with respect to its issuance of a federal wetlands permit.

•

Delays in receiving a federal wetlands permit impacted the scheduled progression of mining activities for the extension of our South Fort Meade,
Florida, phosphate rock mine into Hardee County. As a result, we began to experience idle time with a portion of our mining equipment at the mine in the latter part of fiscal 2010. On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued the
federal wetlands permit. We subsequently initiated site preparation activities to begin mining the extension property in the third quarter of calendar 2010.

On June 30, 2010, certain environmental groups filed a lawsuit contesting the issuance of the federal wetlands permit, alleging that
the issuance of the permit violates several federal laws relating to the protection of the environment and was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law. On July 1, 2010, the court issued a
temporary restraining order prohibiting the Corps and us from conducting any activities in reliance on the federal wetlands permit issued by the Corps. The temporary restraining order remains in effect through July 28, 2010 unless modified or
extended by the court. The court also held a hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction on July 22, 2010.

If a preliminary injunction is entered by the court and mining of the Hardee County Extension is not permitted, we expect that we will
need to shut down, in whole or in part, mining activities at the South Fort Meade mine for an indefinite period of time, resulting in layoffs of employees, significant costs to suspend operations, idle plant costs and possible other adverse impacts
on our Phosphates operations.

We have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in Florida, including the
lawsuit contesting the issuance of the federal wetlands permit for the extension of our South Fort Meade mine into Hardee County, under “Environmental, Health and Safety Matters—Permitting

”

in our Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. This information is incorporated herein by reference.



We are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations. These
financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements. If we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements, we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business
as we have in the past. Our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

In many cases, as a condition to procuring or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise, we are required to comply with financial assurance
regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation of our facilities. In most cases, these
financial assurance requirements can be satisfied without the need for any expenditure of corporate funds to the extent our financial statements meet certain balance sheet and income statement financial strength tests. In the event that we are
unable to satisfy these financial strength tests, we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies. Potential
alternative methods of compliance include negotiating a consent decree that imposes alternative financial assurance or other conditions or, alternatively, providing credit support in the form of cash escrows, surety bonds from insurance companies,
letters of credit from banks, or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements. Use of these alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us. Some of them, such as
letters of credit, also use a portion of our available liquidity. Other alternative means of financial assurance, such as surety bonds, may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post
additional collateral (typically in the form of cash or letters of credit) at the request of the issuer of the bonds. Collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion
of our available liquidity, or in the form of assets such as real estate, which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets. In the past, we have not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests, and in the future, it is
possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests, negotiate consent decrees, establish escrow accounts or obtain letters of credit, surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and conditions or at
a reasonable cost, or that the form and/or cost of compliance could increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The other environmental regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

In addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements, we are subject to numerous other environmental, health and
safety laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada, China, Brazil and other countries where we operate. These laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters, including environmental controls, land reclamation, discharges to air and water and
remediation of hazardous substance releases. They significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures. In some international jurisdictions, environmental laws change frequently and it
may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time.

We are, and may in
the future be, involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us. These proceedings include “legacy” matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never
owned or operated.

We have in the past been, are currently and may in the future be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that
could be material to our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. These proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters, including:

•

Allegations by the government or private parties that we have violated the permitting, financial assurance or other environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations discussed above. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is engaged in an ongoing review of mineral processing



industries, including us and other phosphoric acid producers, under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also involved in other proceedings alleging that, or to review whether,
we have violated environmental laws in the United States and Brazil.

•

Other environmental, health and safety matters, including alleged personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, subsidence from mining operations,
natural resource damages and other damage to the environment, arising out of operations, including accidents. For example, several actions were initiated by the government and private parties related to releases of phosphoric acid process wastewater
at our Riverview, Florida facility during the hurricanes in 2004.

•

Antitrust, commercial, tax and other disputes. For example, we are currently one of a number of defendants in multiple class-action lawsuits, in which
the plaintiffs seek unspecified amounts of damages including treble damages, alleging that we and other defendants conspired to, among other matters, fix the price at which potash was sold in the United States, allocated market shares and customers
and fraudulently concealed their anticompetitive conduct.

The legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or
may in the future be subject can, depending on the circumstances, result in monetary damage awards, fines, penalties, other liabilities, injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt, impede or otherwise materially affect our
business operations, and/or criminal sanctions.

Among other environmental laws, the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act imposes liability, including for cleanup costs, without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain categories of persons, including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are
considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment. Under CERCLA, or various U.S. state analogs, one party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its proportional share of
cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. As a crop nutrient company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances, we will periodically incur liabilities and cleanup costs,
under CERCLA and other environmental laws, with regard to our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third party facilities or offsite disposal locations.

Pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities, including operations at current facilities. They may also
arise out of past activities by us, our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold. These past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or
operated.

We have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in Note 21 of our
Consolidated Financial Statements and in this report in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”.

These legal and regulatory
proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

The permitting, financial assurance and other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent
over time. This could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations, and the increased effects could be material.

Continued
government and public emphasis on environmental, health and safety issues in the U.S., Canada, China, Brazil and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent
than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report. These more stringent requirements may include among other matters increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will
be charged against income from future operations, increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject, increased efforts or



costs to obtain permits or denial of permits, and other matters that could increase our expenses, capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business, liquidity or financial
condition. In addition, to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate, such as China, India, Former Soviet Union countries or Morocco, are less stringent than in the countries where we operate, our competitors could
gain cost or other competitive advantages over us. These effects could be material.

Among other matters, in January 2010, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (“

EPA

”) proposed a rule that would impose numeric criteria for the discharge of nitrogen and/or phosphorous into Florida lakes and streams. The EPA’s proposed criteria would limit the
discharge of nitrogen and/or phosphorous into Florida lakes and streams, and these levels could require us and other entities to control or limit these discharges substantially below current levels. We are evaluating the impact of the proposed
criteria on our operations. We cannot predict whether EPA will finalize a numeric nutrient criteria rule, what the final terms of such a rule would be, whether prospective compliance with such a rule would adversely affect our results of operations,
liquidity or capital resources, or whether any such adverse effects could be material to us.

Regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas
emissions in the United States, Canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us, and these effects could be material.

Various governmental
initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world. These initiatives could restrict our operating activities, require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating
costs, reduce our efficiency or limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our energy, raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability, or otherwise adversely affect our results of
operations, liquidity or capital resources, and these effects could be material to us.

Governmental
greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others:

•

Initiatives in the United States

:

•

EPA Regulations.

In December 2009, the EPA finalized its previously proposed Endangerment Finding under the Clean Air Act that motor vehicles
are sources of greenhouse gases that are reasonably anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. Subsequently, on May 13, 2010, the EPA issued its final Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“

PSD

”) and Title V
Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (the “

Tailoring Rule

”). Under the Tailoring Rule, (i) beginning in January 2011, sources that are currently subject to the PSD requirements that undergo modifications that increase their
greenhouse gas emissions by 75,000 short tons per year will be subject to PSD permitting requirements for greenhouse gas emissions and (ii) beginning in July 2011, new projects that are not otherwise subject to the PSD requirements will become
subject to PSD requirements if they emit greenhouse gas emissions of more than 100,000 short tons per year.

•

Congressional Legislation.

The U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation that would establish a comprehensive program to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. This legislation could mandate increased use of renewable energy sources, increased energy efficiency, and an economy-wide emission cap and trade program. Many other bills have been introduced both in the U.S. House of
Representatives and the U.S. Senate.

•

State Initiatives.

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (“

FDEP

”) is conducting rulemaking proceedings to
develop a greenhouse gas cap and trade regulatory program applicable to electric utilities. Some public documents and discussions that are part of the FDEP’s rulemaking process have considered our Phosphates’ business segment’s
electricity cogeneration facilities to be includable in such a regulatory program.



•

Initiatives in Canada—Kyoto Protocol

.

In December 2002, the Prime Minister of Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol,
committing Canada to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions on average to six percent below 1990 levels through the first commitment period (2008-2012). Developments in Canada’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases include:

•

In March 2008, Canada announced a new Climate Change Plan for Canada which established a target of reducing greenhouse gases 20% from 2006 levels by
2020. In May 2009, the Minister of Environment indicated implementation may be delayed to assure sufficient alignment with the evolving approach in the U.S. to avoid trade sanctions.

•

In May 2009, the Province of Saskatchewan, in which our Canadian potash mines are located, began to consider legislation intended to lead to the
development and administration of climate change regulation in Saskatchewan by the Province rather than the federal government. Key elements under consideration by the Province include a primary focus on achieving the 20% reduction by 2020 through
technological advancements; creation of a Technology Fund to allow large final emitters of greenhouse gases to obtain required greenhouse gas emission credits by paying into the fund and using this fund for approved research and development projects
targeted primarily at applied technological improvements; and creation of a “Green” Foundation Fund intended to be used more broadly for grass roots research and development.

•

International Initiatives.

Although international negotiations concerning greenhouse gas emission reductions and other responses to climate
change are underway, final obligations in the post-Kyoto Protocol period after 2012 remain undefined. Any new international agreements addressing climate change could adversely affect our operating activities, energy, raw material and
transportation costs, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, and these effects could be material. In addition, to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate, such as China, India, Former
Soviet Union countries or Morocco, are less stringent than in the United States or Canada, our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us.

Future climate change could adversely affect us, and these effects could be material.

The prospective impact of potential climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain.

Some scientists
have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe.
These impacts could vary by geographic location. At the present time, we cannot predict the prospective impact of potential climate change on our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, or whether any such effects could be
material to us.

Some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive
disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability. These competitors include state-owned and government-subsidized entities in other countries.

We compete with a number of producers in North America and throughout the world, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Some of these
entities may have greater total resources than we do, and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are. In addition, some of these entities may have access to lower cost or government-subsidized natural gas supplies,
placing us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social
goals. To the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels, the price of our products, our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected.



We have substantial cash balances that we invest in what we believe to be relatively short-term, highly
liquid and high credit quality investments. We intend the investment risks, including counterparty default and lack of liquidity, on these types of investments to be relatively low, but market rates of return on these types of investments are also
generally relatively low. In addition, our efforts to manage the investment risks could be unsuccessful. This could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

Our significant cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cash-equivalents of approximately $2.5 billion at May 31, 2010. Our cash and
cash-equivalents should continue to increase when we generate cash from operations, except to the extent we reinvest in our business or make distributions to our stockholders. We generally invest these cash and cash-equivalents in what we believe to
be relatively short-term, highly liquid and high credit quality instruments. Because of these characteristics of our cash and cash-equivalents, the market rates of return on them are lower than our expectations for the return on capital invested in
our business operations. Moreover, our efforts to manage investment risk by focusing our investing on short-term, highly liquid and high credit quality investments could prove unsuccessful. The likelihood that our efforts to manage investment risk
might prove unsuccessful is heightened during times when there is significant turmoil in the financial markets. As a result, counterparties could default on their obligations to us, or the liquidity of financial instruments that we hold could become
impaired. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

We do not
own a controlling equity interest in our non-consolidated companies, some of which are foreign companies, and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such
businesses. There may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control. Together, these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of
operations.

We hold several minority ownership interests in crop nutrient manufacturing or distribution companies that are not controlled
by us. As some of these companies are significant to us, their results of operations materially affect our equity earnings. Because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign
jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies, we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently, pay dividends, or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue
of our board or stockholder representation. As a result, these companies may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our equity earnings and cash flow, negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity.

Strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs.

Our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force. A significant portion of our workforce is covered by collective
bargaining agreements with unions. Unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns. Any disruptions may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes. The risk of
adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times.

Accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities, interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the
need for significant safety or other expenditures.

We engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents.
Mining, in particular, can be a dangerous activity. If our safety procedures are not effective, we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death, our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or
abandon affected facilities. Accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities. For example:

•

Our Esterhazy mine has had an inflow of brine for more than 20 years. At various times, we have experienced new or increased inflows at the mine.
The Esterhazy mine is not insured against the



risk of floods and water inflows and the costs to control the brine inflows could increase in future years. The brine inflows, risk to employees or remediation costs could also cause us to change
our mining process or abandon this mine, which in turn could significantly negatively impact our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Since December 1985, we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our Esterhazy, Saskatchewan mine. Over the past century, several
potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded. In order to control brine inflows at Esterhazy, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenditures, certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized, while others have
been charged to expense.

At various times, we have experienced new or increased brine inflows at the Esterhazy mine. For
example, in late 2006, we identified a new salt saturated brine inflow in a mined out area located approximately 7,500 feet from our existing brine inflow management area. Initial data suggested that the new inflow was at the rate of 20,000 to
25,000 gallons per minute, which was significantly greater than the highest inflow rates that we had successfully managed (approximately 10,000 to 15,000 gallons per minute) at the Esterhazy mine since 1985. Without abatement, and assuming our
initial estimates to be accurate, we estimated that we had storage capacity to handle the new brine inflow for several months before adversely affecting production at the Esterhazy mine. Our remediation efforts included grouting that reduced the
level of the inflows to approximately historical rates and pumping to reduce the level of brine in the mine. See “Potash Net Sales and Gross Margin” in our Management’s Analysis for a discussion of costs and other information relating
to the brine inflows. Inflow rate measurements reflect an estimate as of a particular point in time, and depending on when tests are conducted, rates can fluctuate up or down. There can be no assurance that:

•

the pumping, grouting and other measures that we use to mitigate the inflows at the Esterhazy mine will continue to be successful in mitigating the
inflows;

•

our estimates of the volumes of the brine inflow or storage capacity for brine at the Esterhazy mine are accurate;

•

the volumes of the brine inflows will not fluctuate from time to time, the rate of the brine inflows will not be greater than our current assumptions
and that any such fluctuations or increases would not be material; or

•

the expenditures to control the inflows will be consistent with our current estimates.

It is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at Esterhazy may further increase beyond our current estimates in the future and that
such an increase could be material, or, in the extreme scenario, that the water inflows, risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine.

Due to the ongoing brine inflow problem at Esterhazy, underground operations at this facility are currently not insurable for water
incursion problems. Our mines at Colonsay, Saskatchewan, and Carlsbad, New Mexico, are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations.

•

Some of our mines are subject to potential damage from earthquakes.

The excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event.
The rise and fall of water levels, such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our Esterhazy mine, can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event. Our Esterhazy mine has
experienced minor seismic events from time to time. A significant seismic event at one of our mines could result in damage to or flooding of the mine or, in the extreme scenario, cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine.



•

Our underground potash shaft mines are subject to risk from fire. In the event of a fire, if our emergency procedures are not successful, we could
have significant injuries or deaths. In addition, fire at one of our underground shaft mines could halt our operations at the affected mine while we investigate the origin of the fire or for longer periods for remedial work or otherwise.

Our underground potash shaft mines at Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, Colonsay, Saskatchewan and Carlsbad, New
Mexico are subject to risk from fire, For example, in January 2006, we experienced a fire at our Esterhazy mine. At the time of the fire, there were 72 mine workers underground. These mine workers were safely evacuated the following day. We
halted operations at our Esterhazy mine for over a week during our investigation of the origin of the fire. Any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death, or lengthier shutdowns, which could result in
significant liabilities and/or impact on the financial performance of our Potash business, including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

•

We handle significant quantities of ammonia at several of our facilities. If our safety procedures are not effective, an accident involving our
ammonia operations could result in serious injuries or death, or result in the shutdown of our facilities.

We produce ammonia at our Faustina, Louisiana phosphate concentrates plant, use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our Florida
and Louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities. For our Florida phosphates concentrates plants, ammonia is received at terminals in Tampa and transported by pipelines to our facilities. Our
ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures. An accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death, or the evacuation of areas near an accident. An accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of
our Florida or Louisiana phosphates concentrates plants, the ammonia terminals or pipelines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities. As a result, an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

•

We also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities. If our safety procedures are not effective, an accident
involving these other hazardous or volatile chemicals could result in serious injuries or death, or result in the shutdown of our facilities.

We use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our Florida and Louisiana operations. Some of our Florida and
Louisiana facilities produce fluorosilicic acid, which is a hazardous chemical, for resale to third parties. We also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities. An accident involving any of these chemicals could
result in serious injuries or death, or evacuation of areas near an accident. An accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities, or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged
facilities. As a result, an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. For example, in October 2006, an explosion occurred at our Faustina, Louisiana
ammonia plant, which is located adjacent to our phosphate production facility. As a result, the ammonia plant was idle for repairs until mid-January 2007.

Deliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or
the public and result in liability to us.

Intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply
chain. Our facilities could be damaged or destroyed, reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost. Employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical
injury for which we could be liable. Governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. The consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and
financial condition.



We may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject. Increases in crop
nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws.

We are subject to antitrust and competition laws in
various countries throughout the world. We cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation, administration and enforcement will change over time. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement,
may limit our existing or future operations and growth, or the operations of Canpotex Limited and the Phosphate Chemicals Export Association, Inc., which serve as export associations for our Potash and Phosphates businesses, respectively. Increases
in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws and can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted, administered or enforced in a manner that
could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

We may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices.

Increases in prices for, among other things, food, fuel and crop inputs (including crop nutrients) have in the past been the subject of significant
discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world. In response to increases, it is possible that governments in one of more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take
actions that could affect us. Such actions could include, among other matters, changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels (including changes in subsidy levels), price controls, tariffs, windfall profits taxes or export or
import taxes. Any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our competitive position
could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation.

Most of our products are readily
available from a number of competitors, and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense. In addition, crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale. As a result,
particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs, the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation. Mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations. We expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could
continue. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations, acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. In the future, we may not be able to find suitable companies to
combine with, assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue. Even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities, we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms. If we do not
successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation, our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure, which could adversely affect our sales and
profitability.

Our risk management strategy may not be effective.

Our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products, the purchase price of natural gas, ammonia and sulfur consumed in
operations, freight and shipping costs and foreign currency exchange rates. We periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks. However, our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure
to these fluctuations. See “Market Risk” in our Management’s Analysis and Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in Part II, Item 8.

A shortage of railcars, barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer
dissatisfaction, loss of production or sales, and higher transportation or equipment costs.

We rely heavily upon truck, rail, barge and
ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers. In addition, the cost of transportation is an important part of the final



sale price of our products. Finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers. Higher costs for these transportation
services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand, high fuel prices, labor disputes, layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers, adverse weather or other environmental events,
or changes to rail, barge or ocean freight systems, could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers, which could affect our performance and results of operations.

Strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation, both
domestically and internationally. Shortages of railcars, barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs. In addition,
during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response. Delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages, including vessels, barges, railcars and
trucks, could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential, which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations.

A lack of customers’ access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products.

Some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products. A lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries, due to the
global or local economic conditions or for other reasons, could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients.

For example, the recent global
economic crisis reduced the availability of credit to borrowers worldwide. A lack of available credit was one of several significant factors that adversely affected international customers’ demand for crop nutrients in some countries in our
fiscal year ended May 31, 2009.

We extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to
purchase our products. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks. Increases in prices for crop nutrient, other agricultural inputs and grain may
increase this risk.

We extend trade credit to our customers in the United States and throughout the world, in some cases for extended
periods of time. In Brazil, where there are fewer third-party financing sources available to farmers, we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our
products. As our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in Brazil increases, we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed.
Additionally, we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions, fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies, and other factors that influence the price, supply and demand for agricultural commodities.
Significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Increases in prices for crop
nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers. The larger dollar value of our customers’ purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us and/or increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our
products. Either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee. In addition, increases in prices for other agricultural
inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements, indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers, increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee, and decrease the
likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default.

Cargill’s status as a significant
stockholder and its representation on our Board of Directors may create conflicts of interest with our other stockholders and could cause us to take actions that may not be beneficial to our other stockholders or that our other stockholders do not
support.

As of May 31, 2010, Cargill owned 64.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, seven Cargill nominees
are members of our twelve-member Board of Directors. Accordingly, Cargill effectively



controls our strategic direction and significant corporate transactions, and its interests in these matters may conflict with the interests of other stockholders of Mosaic. As a result, Cargill
could cause us to take actions that may not be beneficial to our other stockholders or that our other stockholders do not support.

Cargill’s significant ownership interest in Mosaic and our classified Board of Directors and other anti-takeover provisions could deter an
acquisition proposal for Mosaic that other stockholders may consider favorable.

Because Cargill is the owner of a majority of the shares
of our common stock, a third party will not be able to acquire control of us without Cargill’s consent because Cargill could vote its shares of our common stock against any takeover proposal submitted for stockholder approval. In addition, we
have a classified Board of Directors and other takeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Cargill’s ownership interest in us and these other anti-takeover provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals for us
and could delay or prevent a change of control of Mosaic. These deterrents could make it very difficult for non-Cargill holders to remove or replace members of our Board of Directors or management, which could be detrimental to our other
stockholders.

Our stockholders may be adversely affected if Cargill were to, among other things, increase its ownership percentage of our
common stock above 64.2% or seek additional representation on our Board of Directors, any of which could have an impact on the price of our common stock. Our stockholders may also be adversely affected if Cargill were to transfer all or a
significant percentage of its interest in our common stock to a third party.

Cargill is free to increase its ownership interest in our
common stock. Purchases of additional shares of our common stock by Cargill could result in lower trading volumes for our common stock and make it difficult for stockholders to sell shares of our common stock.

In addition, Cargill is permitted to sell its shares of our common stock. Cargill’s sale or transfer of a significant number of shares of our common
stock could create a decline in the price of our common stock. Furthermore, if Cargill’s sales or transfers were made to a single buyer or group of buyers, it could result in a third party acquiring effective control of Mosaic.

Cargill is also free to seek to increase its representation on the Mosaic Board of Directors above seven members. This action could further increase
Cargill’s control over Mosaic and deter or delay an acquisition of Mosaic thereby having a negative impact on the price of our common stock.

Our success will increasingly depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees.

We believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees. Like many businesses, a significant number of our
employees, including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in potash and phosphates operations, will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond. In addition, we compete for a talented workforce
with other businesses, particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular. Our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to retain and to attract and train highly qualified and
motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our expansion plans. If we were to be unsuccessful in retaining, attracting and training the employees we require, our ongoing operations and expansion
plans could be materially and adversely affected.

The success of our Potash expansion plans and other strategic initiatives depends on our
ability to effectively manage these initiatives.

We have initiated several significant strategic initiatives, principally our plans to
expand the annual production capacity of our Potash business by more than five million tonnes of finished product by 2020. These strategic



initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management. To the extent the processes we put in place
to manage these initiatives are not effective, our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We have included information about legal and environmental proceedings in Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. This information is
incorporated herein by reference.

We are also subject to the following legal and environmental proceedings in addition to those described in
Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

Fosfertil Merger Proceedings

. In December 2006, Fosfertil and Bunge Fertilizantes S.A. (“

Bunge Fertilizantes

”) proposed
a reorganization pursuant to which Bunge Fertilizantes would become a subsidiary of Fosfertil and subsidiaries of Bunge Limited (“

Bunge Group

”) would increase their ownership in Fosfertil. Pursuant to the proposed
reorganization, our existing 20.1% ownership interests in Fosfertil would have been diluted to approximately 10% of the combined enterprise.

In June 2006, Mosaic Fertilizantes do Brasil Ltda. (formerly known as Mosaic Fertilizantes do Brasil S.A.) (“

Mosaic
Brazil

”) filed a lawsuit against Fosfertil, Fertifos and other subsidiaries of Bunge Group (collectively, the “

Bunge Parties

”) in the Civil Court of the Central District in Sao Paulo, Brazil (the
“

Civil Court

”), challenging the validity of corporate actions taken by Fosfertil and Fertifos in advance of the proposal for the reorganization. These corporate actions included, among other things, actions taken at an April
2006 meeting of the shareholders of Fertifos to replace our representatives on the Fertifos Board of Directors and subsequent acts by the reconstituted Fertifos Board. Following various proceedings and decisions in the Brazilian courts, in August
2009, the Superior Court of Justice (the “

Superior Court

”) upheld an April 2007 decision against us by the Civil Court in this lawsuit. In March 2010, we filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against the
Superior Court’s August 2009 decision.

In December 2006 and May 2007, Mosaic Brazil filed additional lawsuits in
the Civil Court seeking annulment of the vote by Fertifos’ Board of Directors approving the proposed reorganization. These lawsuits were against (i) Fertifos and its directors on the grounds that the Board of Directors lacked statutory
authority to decide the matter and (ii) Fertifos, its directors, and Fosfertil based on conflicts of interests on the part of the Fertifos’ directors appointed by Bunge Fertilizantes. In January 2009, the Civil Court ruled in favor of
Mosaic Brazil in both of these lawsuits and declared the vote by Fertifos’ Board of Directors approving the proposed reorganization null and void. In April 2009, the defendants appealed the Civil Court’s rulings in Mosaic Brazil’s
favor to the State Court of Appeal.

In February 2007, Mosaic Brazil petitioned the Brazilian Securities Commission,
challenging, among other things, the valuation placed by the Bunge Parties on Fosfertil. In connection with the pending acquisition of Mosaic Brazil’s equity interests in Fertifos and Fosfertil by Vale, as discussed under “Phosphates
Segment—Sale of Fosfertil and Cubatao Facility” in Part I, Item 1, “Business,” Mosaic



Brazil and Vale have agreed to release and waive all rights in connection with these proceedings. Motions for dismissal have been filed with, and the dismissals are pending approval before, the
applicable courts. As the motions for dismissal are approved by the courts, these proceedings will be concluded.

New Wales Multifos Kiln Testing Issues.

We have reported to the EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection certain
irregularities in our testing related to compliance with the nitrous oxide emission limits in the air permit for a kiln used for production of Multifos animal feed at our New Wales, Florida, phosphate concentrates plant. We understand that both
federal and state enforcement officials are considering whether to bring enforcement actions with respect to the testing irregularities. We cannot predict whether federal or state enforcement officials will bring enforcement actions or the
amount or nature of any potential penalties or other liabilities that would be sought; however, we do not expect that resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our business or financial condition.
