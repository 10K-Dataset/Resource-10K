PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

We
are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of
travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation
packages and cruises.  We offer our
customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a
traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your Own Price

®

service, which allows our
customers to make offers for travel services at discounted prices.  At present, we derive substantially all of
our revenues from the following sources:

•

Transaction revenues from
our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages
service;

•

Commissions earned from the
sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel
services;

•

Customer processing fees
charged in connection with the sale of both

Name
Your Own Price

®

and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars service;

•

Worldspan, L.P. reservation
booking fees related to both our

Name Your
Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car service, and price-disclosed airline
tickets and rental car service;

•

Transaction revenue from our
price-disclosed hotel room service; and


•

Other revenues derived primarily
from selling advertising on our websites.

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, we had revenues of approximately $963 million
comprised of “merchant” revenue, “agency” revenue and “other” revenue.  Merchant revenues are derived from
transactions where we are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among
other things, collecting receipts from our customers, remitting payments to our
suppliers and establishing the selling price of the services that we offer.  Merchant revenues, which represented the
substantial majority of our total revenues in 2005, consisted of: (1)

transaction
revenues representing the selling price of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars
and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing
the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in
connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed
hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale
of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels;
and (4) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees
related to certain of the aforementioned transactions

.  Agency revenues are generally derived from
retail travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and
where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency
revenues consisted primarily of: (1) travel commissions; (2) customer
processing fees; and (3) Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to
certain of the aforementioned transactions.

Other revenues consisted primarily of revenue from advertising on our
websites.

Priceline.com
was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted
into a Delaware corporation in July 1998. 
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the
symbol “PCLN.”  Our principal executive
offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06854.

The
priceline.com Business Model

Name Your Own Price

®

.  We have developed a unique pricing system
known as a “demand collection system” that uses the information sharing and
communications power of the Internet to create a new way of pricing products
and services.  We believe we have created
a balance between the interests of buyers, who are willing to accept trade-offs
in order to save money, and sellers, who are prepared to generate incremental
revenue by selling their products at below retail prices, provided that they
can do so without disrupting their existing distribution channels or retail
pricing structures.  Our demand
collection system allows consumers to specify the price they are prepared to
pay when submitting an offer for a particular leisure travel service within a
specified range of substitutability.  We
then access databases in which participating suppliers file secure discounted
rates not generally available to the public, to determine whether we can
fulfill the customer’s offer and then decide whether we want to accept the
offer at the price designated by the consumer. 
For most of these transactions, we establish the price we will accept
for our services, have discretion in supplier selection and are the merchant of
record in the transaction.  Consumers
agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time (generally, not
longer than one minute) to enable us to determine whether we can or want to
accept the offer.  Once fulfilled, offers
generally cannot be canceled – thereby making purchases by our customers
generally non-refundable.  This system
uses the flexibility of buyers to enable sellers to accept a lower price in
order to sell their excess inventory or capacity.  We believe that our demand collection system
addresses limitations inherent in traditional seller-driven pricing mechanisms
in a manner that offers substantial benefits to both buyers and sellers.  We believe that the principal advantages of
our system include the following:

•

Cost Savings

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

demand collection system allows consumers to save money in a simple and
compelling way.  Buyers effectively trade
off flexibility about brands, product features and/or sellers in return for
prices that are lower than those that can be obtained at that time through
traditional retail distribution channels.


•

Incremental Revenue for Sellers

.  Sellers use our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand collection system as a revenue management tool to
generate incremental revenue without disrupting their existing distribution
channels or retail pricing structures. 
We require consumers to be flexible with respect to brands and product
features.  As a result, our

Name Your Own Price

®

system does not reveal
sellers’ brands to customers prior to the consummation of a transaction,
thereby protecting their brand integrity. 
This shielding of brand identity and price enables sellers to sell
products and services at discounted prices without cannibalizing their own
retail sales by publicly announcing discount prices and without competing
against their own distributors.

•

Proprietary Seller Networks

.  We have assembled proprietary networks of
industry leading sellers that represent high quality brands.  By establishing attractive networks of seller
participants with reputations for quality, scale and national presence, we
believe that we foster increased participation by both buyers and sellers.

We often refer to products offered through our

Name Your Own Price

®

service as “opaque” products
because all aspects of the travel service are not visible to the consumer
before making an offer.

Price-Disclosed Retail Services

.  We also offer customers the ability to purchase price-disclosed travel services
at retail prices, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental car days,
vacations packages, destination services and cruises.  We introduced the following price-disclosed
services gradually over the past two and a half years:

•

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we began
offering customers the ability to purchase airline tickets at disclosed, retail
prices;

•

In
the second quarter of 2004, we acquired Travelweb LLC (“Travelweb”), which
allowed us to offer customers a price-disclosed hotel service on our website,
www.lowestfare.com;

•

In
the second quarter of 2004, we implemented a new feature on our vacation
packages service that allows customers to choose between an “opaque” or a
disclosed flight itinerary;

•

In
the fourth quarter of 2004, we launched a search and booking engine on
priceline.com to allow customers to choose between a

Name Your Own Price

®

or a price-disclosed rental car offering; and

•

In
the first quarter of 2005, we began offering price-disclosed hotel rooms on our
website, www.priceline.com.

In the first quarter of 2006, we introduced

More Ways to
Save

on the priceline.com website.

More Ways to Save

is a unique travel
shopping format that provides retail, price-disclosed travel options matching
the itinerary criteria requested by the customer, accompanied with money saving
alternatives, including our

Name Your Own
Price

®

service, packaging options, and alternative itinerary options such as different
dates or airports.  We have also
introduced “PriceBreakers

SM

” which is a presentation
of selected travel itineraries at discounted prices that is updated daily.

We
believe that the combination of our

Name
Your Own Price

®

model and our retail price-disclosed
model allows us to provide a broad array of options to value-conscious
travelers, while providing us with diverse streams of revenue.

We
also offer a retail, price-disclosed hotel service in Europe through our
European operations, which we have developed through two recent
acquisitions.  In

September
2004, we acquired Active Hotels Ltd. (“Active Hotels”), a United Kingdom based
Internet hotel reservation distributor. Furthermore,
in July 2005, we acquired Amsterdam-based Bookings B.V. (“Bookings”), one of
Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation services, with offices primarily in
Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Loule, Paris, Rome and Pisa.  All of our European operations, including
Active Hotels and Bookings, are


majority-owned by us.  We work with almost 20,000 chain-owned and
independently owned hotels throughout Europe offering hotel reservations on
various websites and in multiple languages.

For geographic related
information, see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
priceline.com Strategy

The online travel category has continued to experience significant worldwide
growth as consumer purchasing shifts from traditional off-line channels to
interactive online channels. 
Priceline.com has been a leader in the deep discount segment of this
market and, in the last two years, has embarked on a strategy to participate
more broadly in online travel growth by expanding its service offerings and
markets.

•

Expand Service Offerings

.  In 2003, we began to execute a plan to
broaden our array of service offerings beyond our

Name Your Own Price

®

services. 
Specifically, we have expended significant resources to allow us to
introduce price-disclosed retail services to our consumers to compliment our
existing

Name Your Own Price

®

service.  We believe that by offering a “one-stop-shopping”
solution to our customers, we can simultaneously fulfill the needs of those
customers who are prepared to accept the unique restrictions of our

Name Your Own Price

®

service in exchange for
receiving significant savings relative to retail prices, as well as those
customers who are less price sensitive and require the certainty of knowing the
full details of their travel itinerary prior to purchasing.  We believe that our evolution to a “one-stop-shopping”
website allows us to more fully participate in the overall growth of the online
travel category.

•

Offer

More Ways to
Save

.

Through the
www.priceline.com website, we offer our customers the unique ability to shop
and book price-disclosed or

Name Your Own
Price

®

travel services in a single, integrated display.  We are continuously improving the integration
and display of these two services so that our customers can quickly and easily
find the way to save that is best suited for each trip they take, while
maximizing user conversion and profitability. 
In addition to our

Name Your Own
Price

®

service, we offer additional money saving
alternatives, such as alternative airports or dates and discounted packaged
travel.  We intend to develop new money
saving features for many of our services.

•

Enhance Service Offerings

.  We intend to continually enhance our service
offerings, particularly our more recently introduced retail offerings, by
adding competitive functionality, adding competitive inventory at competitive
pricing, adding and improving the content and merchandising on our website as
well as cross-sell opportunities to maximize customer conversion.

•

Competitive functionality:

We continue to
expend significant resources to remain competitive in terms of the features and
functionality we offer our customers. 
For example, since launching our retail air service two years ago, we
have added the ability to search for flexible dates or alternative airports,
book one-way and multi-destination itineraries and easily make modifications to
search criteria.  We intend to add additional
functionality such as the ability to search child and senior fares and to
access real time seat maps.

•

Competitive inventory at competitive pricing:

We
believe that securing competitive inventory at competitive pricing is critical
to our success.  For example, over the
last two years, the number of destinations available in our vacation package service
has doubled and we have added nearly 2,000 hotels.  With respect to our hotel service, we intend
to integrate our European and U.S. supply so that all of our customers can access
the entire inventory made available to us by our suppliers, regardless of the
specific site on which the consumer transacts.


•

Content and merchandising:

As part of our
evolution to a “one-stop-shopping” website, we have added thousands of pages of
content to allow customers to research destinations and hotel properties before
booking a reservation.  We offer property
descriptions, maps, images, and user reviews whereby our customers can benefit
from the experiences and opinions of other customers.  We introduced “PriceBreakers

SM

,” which is a presentation of
selected travel itineraries at discounted prices that is updated daily.  We intend to continue to improve our content
and merchandising with more comprehensive descriptions, more and higher quality
images, and more user reviews, which we believe will improve conversion of
users shopping on our website.

•

Cross-sell opportunities

: We also cross-sell different
travel components to maximize the revenue we generate from each customer.  In 2004 and 2005, we developed functionality
that allows customers to “add-on” travel components to their selection, both
during the shopping experience and at time of purchase.  For example, customers can add a rental car
reservation to their air or hotel reservation, or a hotel reservation to their
air reservation.  Customers can also add
destination related services such as shuttles, tours and activities.  Additionally, we cross-sell opaque services
on our retail path and retail services on our opaque path.  For example, an unsuccessful opaque air
customer may be offered a price-disclosed alternative, while a retail hotel
customer may be offered the

Name Your Own
Price

®

alternative for greater
savings.  We intend to further enhance
these cross-sell opportunities across all of our services.

•

Offer Travel Suppliers Valuable Distribution

.  We strive to be the preferred discount
distribution channel for airlines, hotels and rental car companies.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

service protects supplier brand and published pricing and our packages and
other merchandising provide access to the brand neutral leisure traveler at
attractive distribution costs.

•

Become the top online hotel reservation service in
Europe

.  The size of the
travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than that
within the United States.  Historically,
Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of international
consumers have trailed those of the United States.  However, international consumers –
particularly European consumers – are rapidly moving to online means for
purchasing travel.  Accordingly, recent
international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded and are
expected to continue to substantially exceed the growth rates within the United
States.  Prior to 2004, substantially all
of our revenues were generated within the United States.  In order to take advantage of the growth in
online travel outside of the United States, we acquired Internet hotel reservation
distributors Active Hotels and Bookings in September 2004 and July 2005,
respectively, giving us presence in the expanding European hotel market with almost
20,000 participating hotels across Europe. 
Because of the superior growth rates associated with international
online travel, we intend to continue to invest resources in increasing the
share of our revenues represented by international consumers and capitalize on
the growth of travel between the United States and Europe.

Offerings

Airline Tickets

. 
There are a total of 11 domestic airlines and 27 international airlines
participating in our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket
service.

All

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket requests are made through our websites.  To make an offer, a customer specifies: (1)
the origin and destination of the trip, (2) the dates on which the customer
wishes to depart and return, (3) the price the customer is willing to pay, and
(4) the customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree
to:


•

fly
on any one of our participating airline partners;

•

leave
at any time of day between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on their desired dates of
departure and return;

•

purchase
only round trip coach class tickets between the same two points of departure
and return;

•

accept
at least one stop or connection;

•

receive
no frequent flier miles or upgrades; and

•

accept
tickets that cannot be refunded or changed.

When
we receive an offer, we determine whether to fulfill the offer based upon,
among other things, the available fares, rules and inventory provided to us by
our participating airlines and certain other internal requirements.  A customer is usually notified whether his or
her offer has been accepted in near real-time. 
If we identify an airline ticket that meets the parameters specified by
the customer and that meets our internal requirements, the customer’s offer is
accepted and his or her credit card is charged the offer price, plus applicable
taxes, surcharges and processing fees, and the ticket is delivered to the
customer by the delivery method specified by the customer.  For customers who request it, we guarantee no
more than one connection per leg of trip with a maximum of a 3-hour stop.  As with our other

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services, once a customer’s offer for
airline tickets is accepted, that offer, in almost all cases, cannot be
withdrawn or cancelled and the customer’s purchase will not be refunded.

If
a customer’s offer is not accepted, but we believe the offer is reasonably
close to a price that we would be willing to accept, we will attempt to satisfy
the customer by providing guidance to the customer indicating that changing
certain parameters of the offer would increase the chances of the offer being
accepted.  For example, in some cases we
disclose to the customer that agreeing to fly into an alternate airport would
increase the chances of his or her offer being accepted.  In other cases, we inform the customer that
increasing his or her offer by a certain amount would increase the chances of
it being accepted.  We may also offer a
customer the opportunity to purchase a price-disclosed retail airline ticket.

Retail Airline Tickets.

Since

2003, we have also offered
our customers the ability to purchase retail airline tickets at disclosed
prices and with disclosed itineraries. 
In these transactions, we act as agent for the airline.  The airline sets the retail price paid by the
consumer and is the merchant of record for the transaction.  These airline tickets do not have the
restrictions associated with our

Name Your
Own Price

®

service.  For example, in addition to having fully
disclosed itineraries, retail airline tickets are generally changeable and
cancellable for a fee.

Name Your Own Price

®

Hotels

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation
service currently is available in substantially all major cities and
metropolitan areas in the United States and Europe.  Most significant national hotel chains as
well as several important real estate investment trusts and independent
property owners participate in your

Name
Your Own Price

®

service.  Hotels participate by filing secure private
discounted rates with related inventory control rules in a global distribution
system database.  These specific rates
generally are not available to the general public or to consolidators and other
discount distributors who sell to the public, however, hotel participants may
make similar rates available to consolidators or other discount providers under
other arrangements.

Our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room
reservation service operates in a manner similar to our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket
service.  Consumers are required to
accept certain trade-offs with respect to brands or product features in return
for saving money.  For example, consumers
are required to accept a reservation in any hotel within a specified geographic
area within a designated “class” of service


(1,
2, 3, 4, 5-star or “resort”) and must accept limitations on changes and
cancellations.  As with the airline
ticket service, the target market for our hotel room reservation service is the
leisure travel market.

Retail Hotels.

In May 2004, we added a price-disclosed hotel
service through the acquisition of Travelweb. 
In March 2005, we launched a price-disclosed hotel service on
www.priceline.com that enables our customers to choose between price-disclosed
or

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel rooms. 
Our retail hotel service makes available both agency and merchant model
inventory.  Under the merchant model,
pursuant to merchant arrangements we make directly with individual hotel chains
and independent hotel properties, we receive access to the inventory of
participating hotels directly from the hotels, at a negotiated rate and
determine the retail price at which we will offer our services to the consumer,
within contractual limitations.  Under
the agency model, we receive access to hotel inventory at generally available
rates, and are paid a commission upon a customer’s check-out.  As with our retail airline ticket service,
hotel reservations booked in a retail manner do not have the restrictions
associated with

our

Name Your
Own Price

®

service.  Customers can select the exact hotel they
want to book and the price of the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

In addition, as discussed above,

the acquisitions of Active Hotels in
September 2004, and Bookings in July 2005, gave us a foothold into the
expanding European hotel market, as well as access to European inventory.

Name Your Own Price

®

Rental Cars

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental car service operates in a manner similar to our airline ticket and hotel
reservation services.  Our rental car
services are currently available in substantially all major United States
airport markets.  The top five brand name
airport rental car companies in the United States are seller participants in
our rental car program.  Consumers can
access our website and select where and when they want to rent a car, what kind
of car they want to rent (i.g., economy, compact, mid-size, SUV, etc.) and the
price they want to pay per-day, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.  When we receive an offer, we determine
whether to fulfill the offer based upon the available rates, rules and
inventory.  If a customer’s offer is
accepted, we will immediately reserve the rental car, charge the customer’s
credit card and notify the customer of the rental car company and location
providing the rental car.

Retail Rental Cars.

In 2004, we launched a price-disclosed rental
car service

on www.priceline.com that enables our customers to
choose between price-disclosed or

Name Your
Own Price

®

rental cars.  In 2005, we upgraded our retail rental car
service to accommodate one-way and off-airport reservations.  Our price-disclosed rental car service
operates under the agency model,

under which we earn a
commission upon a successful rental car booking.

As with our retail airline
ticket and hotel reservation services, rental car reservations booked in a
retail manner do not have the restrictions associated with

our

Name
Your Own Price

®

service.  Customers can select the exact car they want
to book and the price of the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

With
respect to each of our airline, hotel and rental car services, we believe the
combination of our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and the retail model allows us to provide
a broad array of options to value-conscious travelers, while providing us with
diverse streams of revenue.

Vacation Packages

.  Our vacation package service allows consumers
to purchase packages consisting of airfare, hotel and rental car
components.  Consumers can select the
exact hotel or resort that they want to reserve, and then select either a
retail airline ticket or an opaque airline ticket for the air component of
their package.  Additionally, consumers
can add destination related services such as tours, shuttles, and
activities.  Vacation packages are sold
at disclosed prices, although consumers cannot determine the exact price of the
individual components.

Destination Services

.  We currently offer customers the opportunity
to purchase destination services such as event tickets, ground transfers, tours,
restaurant meals and other services available at their travel
destinations.  This service is offered to
consumers as part of the process of booking an air,


hotel
and vacation reservation, and also as a standalone service.  In 2005, we expanded our destination services
offering by adding parking in certain locations and expanded ground transfer
options.

Cruises

.  We
also offer price-disclosed cruise trips through NLG, Inc. (“NLG”), an agent
representing major cruise lines.  Our
cruise service allows consumers to search for and compare cruise pricing and
availability information from 16 cruise lines, and to purchase cruises online
or through a call center by selecting from our published offerings and prices.  We receive commissions from NLG on successful
cruise bookings.

Travel Insurance

.  We offer our air, hotel and vacation package
customers an optional travel insurance package that provides coverage for,
among other things, trip cancellation, trip interruption, medical expenses,
emergency evacuation, and loss of baggage, property and travel documents.  The travel insurance is provided by member
companies of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”).  We receive a percentage of the premium from
AIG member companies for every optional insurance package purchased by our
customers.

While
we are currently focused on the travel services described above, over time, we
may evaluate the introduction of other services that we believe could enhance
the travel experience of our customers.

Financial Services

We offer financial services through Priceline Mortgage Company LLC,
d/b/a pricelinemortgage.com, of which we own 49% and hold two of five seats on
the board of managers.  Pursuant to an intellectual property license from
us, pricelinemortgage.com utilizes the priceline.com

Under the terms of an agreement with EverBank Financial Corp,
pricelinemortgage.com allows consumers to access attractive financial services
including, but not limited to, mortgages, home equity loans, and banking
service.  We record our proportionate
share of the results of pricelinemortgage.com as equity income in investees.

Marketing
and Brand Awareness

Priceline.com has established itself as one of the most recognized
e-commerce brands through an aggressive marketing and promotion campaign.  During 2005, our online and offline
advertising expenses were $59 million and $31 million, respectively.  We intend to continue a marketing strategy to
promote brand awareness and the concept that consumers can save money on
products and services while also taking advantage of the “one-stop-shop”
convenience afforded by our suite of travel service offerings.  We advertise primarily through television,
radio and online marketing.  Underlying
our marketing strategy is our belief that our target market is all consumers,
not just Internet-savvy consumers.  We
intend to continue to promote the priceline.com brand aggressively throughout
2006.

As
our European operations become more meaningful contributors to our results, we
have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in our advertising
expense.  Specifically, because our European


operations utilize online affiliate marketing
and Internet search engines, principally through the purchase of travel-related
keywords, as principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our
online advertising expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of
those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout 2006.

Advertising Revenue.

We
sell advertising to travel suppliers and others on our owned websites.

Competition

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the services
offered on priceline.com. The market for the services we offer is intensely
competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a
relatively low cost. In addition, the major online travel companies with which
we compete have significantly greater financial resources and capital than we
do.  For instance, the Cendant
Corporation currently owns Orbitz.com, Inc., Cheaptickets.com, Lodging.com and
European travel sites Gullivers.com, ebookers plc and octopustravel, and Sabre
Group owns Travelocity.com and lastminute.com plc, a European full-service
travel site.  In addition, InterActive
recently spun-off its online travel business, including Hotels.com and
Hotwire.com, our primary competitor in the sale of “opaque” travel services,
into Expedia, which, as a stand-alone company, continues to have significantly
greater resources and capital than priceline.com.  We may not be able to effectively compete
with industry conglomerates such as Cendant, Sabre or Expedia, each of which
have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do.

We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies with
respect to each service we offer. With respect to our travel services, these
competitors include:

•

Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and
Hotwire, which are owned by Expedia; Travelocity and lastminute.com, which are
owned by the Sabre Group; and Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, Gullivers.com, ebookers
plc, octopustravel and Lodging.com, which are currently owned by the Cendant
Corporation;

•

travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and
rental car companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which
they drive business;

•

large online search companies, such as Yahoo! and Google;

•

traditional travel agencies;

•

online
travel search sites such as SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com, Cheapflights.com,
FareChase.com, Kayak.com, or any substantially similar online travel search
business using a business model sometimes referred to as “meta-search”; and

•

operators of travel industry reservation databases such
as Galileo, Worldspan, L.P. and Amadeus.

Competitors of our European operations include, among others, Expedia
(including hotels.com), Cendant Corporation (including ebookers, octopustravel,
Gullivers.com and Flairview), Sabre Group (including lastminute.com),
Superbreak, Venere and Hotel Reservation Service.

In addition, many airline, hotel and rental car suppliers are focusing
on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own
website.  Furthermore, many low cost
airlines, which are having increasing success in the


marketplace,
distribute their inventory exclusively through their own websites.  Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically
do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such
as bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more
attractive to consumers than models like ours.

We potentially face competition from a number of large Internet
companies and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and in
facilitating Internet traffic, including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and
Yahoo!, which compete with us either directly or indirectly through
affiliations with other e-commerce or off-line companies.  We also compete with “meta-search” companies,
which are companies that leverage their search technology to aggregate travel
search results across supplier, travel agent and other websites.  For example, Yahoo! owns FareChase.com, a
travel search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates at travel supplier
and third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites, and AOL is party
to a marketing and technology agreement, and holds a minority interest in, Kayak.com,
another leading meta-search company. 
Other established search engine companies as well as start-ups are
attempting to enter the online travel marketplace in this manner.  If Yahoo!, Google or other portals decide to
refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could result in more
competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition costs for
third-party sites such as ours. 
Competition from these and other sources could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many of our current and potential competitors, including Internet
directories, search engines and large traditional retailers, have longer
operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly
greater financial, marketing, personnel, technical and other resources than
priceline.com. Some of these competitors may be able to secure products and
services on more favorable terms than we can. In addition, many of these
competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to:

•

marketing and
promotional campaigns;

•

attracting traffic to
their websites;

•

attracting and retaining
key employees;

•

securing vendors and
inventory; and

•

website and systems
development.

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss
of market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. See “Risk
Factors – Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our
financial performance.”

Operations
and Technology

Our
business is supported by a systems platform, which was designed with an
emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability.  Our core demand collection and offer
processing systems are proprietary to priceline.com.  The software platform and architecture are
built on server-side Java, C++ and SQL scripts integrated with an Oracle
relational database system.  This
internal platform was designed to include open application protocol interfaces
that can provide connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we
operate.  These include large global
inventory systems, such as airline and hotel room reservation systems and
financial service providers, as well as individual inventory suppliers, such as
individual hotels.  Our Internet servers
utilize VeriSign digital certificates to help us conduct secure communications
and transactions.


We out-source most of our call center and customer service functions,
and use a real-time interactive voice response system with transfer
capabilities to our call centers and customer service centers.

We
rely primarily on the global distribution system (“GDS”) of Worldspan, L.P. in
the sale of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations, and rental car
reservations within the U.S. and Pegasus Solutions, Inc. for the sale of retail
hotel room reservations.  If the
Worldspan or Pegasus GDS becomes inaccessible, or partially inaccessible to us,
due to system failure or otherwise, for any significant amount of time, our
ability to book airline tickets, opaque hotel reservations and rental car
reservations in the case of Worldspan, and retail hotel reservations in the
case of Pegasus, could be adversely affected.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers in the U.S. are
hosted at SAVVIS in Jersey City, New Jersey, which provides communication
links, as well as 24-hour monitoring and engineering support.  SAVVIS has its own generator and multiple
back-up systems in Jersey City. 
Substantial amounts of our computer hardware for operating our services
are also located at SAVVIS in Jersey City. 
We also maintain a second web hosting facility at AT&T in New York
City.  Our network operations center
monitors both web hosting facilities and is located in our Norwalk, Connecticut
headquarters.  All three facilities have
an uninterruptible power supply system, generators and redundant servers.  If SAVVIS were unable, for any reason, to
support our primary web hosting facility, we would need to activate our
secondary site at AT&T.

The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our European
operations are hosted at IX EUROPE, in London, England, and Telecity Netherlands
and Redbus Interhouse Netherlands, in the Netherlands.  See “

Intellectual
Property

We currently hold fifteen issued United States patents, Nos. 5,794,207;
5,897,620; 6,085,169; 6,108,639; 6,134,534; 6,240,396; 6,332,129; 6,345,090;
6,356,878; 6,418,415; 6,466,919; 6,484,153; 6,510,418; 6,553,346; 6,993,503 and
over twenty pending United States and foreign patent applications.  All of our issued United States patents
expire between September 4, 2016 and April 28, 2020.  We file additional patent applications on new
inventions, as appropriate.

While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent
applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that:

•

a
third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us
from practicing features of our business or that will require us to pay for a
license to use those features;

•

our
operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of third
parties;

•

any
patent can be successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

•

the
pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

•

competitors
or potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of
competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;

•

because
of variations in the application of our business model to each of our services,
our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties from
utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more
categories; or

•

new
prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate
an issued patent.


There
has been discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of
so-called “business method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and
Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to intensify the review process
applicable to such patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to
have a direct

effect on patents already granted. We cannot
anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will have on our pending
patent applications. See, “

We
monitor, protect and enforce our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade
dress and trade secrets on an ongoing basis through a combination of laws and
contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements.  For example, we endeavor to register our
trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally,
currently holding over one hundred service mark registrations worldwide.  However, effective trademark, service mark,
copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
which our services are or may be made available online, regardless of our
continuous efforts to police and register our marks.  See, “

We currently own numerous Internet domains in the United States and
abroad.  Domain names are generally
regulated by Internet regulatory bodies. 
The relationship between trademark and unfair competition laws and
domain name registration is evolving. 
The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act in the U.S. and the
Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy of the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers have both significantly enhanced the ability to
deter the improper incorporation of trademarks into domain names by third
parties and to assert our registrations against them.  We actively pursue significant infringers as
appropriate, including cybersquatters and “typosquatters” who misappropriate
our service marks and misspellings thereof as domain names, to maintain our
famous marks and prevent the dilution of their distinctiveness.  See, “

Risk

Factors — Our success depends on our ability

Governmental
Regulation

The
services we provide are subject to various federal, state and local
regulations. For example, our travel service is subject to laws governing the
offer and/or sale of travel services as well as laws requiring us to register
as a “seller of travel.”  In addition,
our services may be subject to various state and local taxing regulations.  See “

Risk Factors

–

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes

”.

In addition, our business is indirectly affected by
regulatory and legal uncertainties affecting travel suppliers and global
distribution systems.  In 2004, the
Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) published a Final Rule, abolishing the
rules governing global distribution systems. 
As a part of the Final Rule, the DOT rejected proposals to regulate
online travel service providers’ fare displays. 
However, the DOT deferred consideration of a proposal to amend its
policies regarding advertising of air tickets, to require that agency service
fees be stated separately from the price being charged by the airlines.  Our current service fee disclosure practices
differ from those proposed by the DOT. 
If the DOT were to


resume consideration of and adopt the service fee
proposal, we may have less flexibility regarding merchandising air travel on
our websites.

We are subject to federal, state and international laws that require
protection of user privacy and user data.  In our processing of travel
transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable
data.  This data is increasingly subject
to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world,
including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection
Directive and variations of that directive in the member states of the European
Union.  Such government action is
typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected,
processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.

Pricelinemortgage.com is
subject to laws governing the licensing and conduct of persons providing
mortgage brokerage services. Such laws typically require certain consumer
protection disclosures and loan solicitation procedures. For example, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits the payment and receipt of mortgage
loan referral fees, and permits persons to be compensated only for the fair
market value of non-referral services. Accordingly, pricelinemortgage.com’s
home financing service provides non-referral services such as website
development and advertising to a licensed mortgage broker who, in turn,
provides the back-end processing for loan referrals.

All
of our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and
regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices.

We
are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses conducting online
commerce. Today there are relatively few laws specifically directed toward
online services. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet
and online services, it is possible that laws and regulations will be adopted
with respect to the Internet or online services. These laws and regulations
could cover issues such as online contracts, user privacy, freedom of
expression, pricing, fraud, content and quality of products and services,
taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security.
Applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as
property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues,
taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is developing, but any such new
legislation could have significant implications on how we conduct online
business. In addition, some states may require us to qualify in that state to
do business as a foreign corporation because our service is available in that
state over the Internet. Although we are qualified to do business in a number
of states, failure to meet the qualifications of certain states, or a
determination that we are required to qualify in additional states, could
subject us to taxes and penalties.  See “

Risk

Factors –
Regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business,”

and

“Uncertainty Regarding State Taxes

.”

Our
European operations are subject to various foreign regulations and governing
bodies that might limit their products and services. They may be affected by
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade
barriers in connection with online commerce. Any failure by our European
operations to comply may have an adverse effect on our business.

Employees

As
of March 1, 2006, we employed approximately 532 full-time employees, of which
285 are based at our Norwalk, Connecticut headquarters. We also retain
independent contractors to support our customer service and system support
functions.

We
have never had a work stoppage and our employees are not represented by any
collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to be
good. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense.


Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other information included in
this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also
impair our business operations.  If any
of the following risks occur, our business, financial

condition, operating results
and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

We are dependent on the airline industry and certain
airlines.

Our financial prospects are significantly dependent upon our sale of
leisure airline tickets.  Leisure travel,
including the sale of leisure airline tickets, is dependent on personal
discretionary spending levels. As a result, sales of leisure airline tickets
and other leisure travel services tend to decline during general economic
downturns and recessions. In addition, unforeseen events, such as terrorist
attacks, political instability, regional hostilities, increases in fuel prices,
imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, travel-related
accidents, travel-related health concerns and unusual weather patterns
also may adversely affect the leisure travel industry. As a result, our
business also is likely to be affected by those events. Further, work stoppages
or labor unrest at any of the major airlines could materially and adversely
affect the airline industry and, as a consequence, have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, sales of airline
tickets from our five largest and two largest airline suppliers accounted for
approximately 82% and 43% of total airline tickets sold, respectively.  As a result, we are currently substantially
dependent upon the continued participation of these airlines in priceline.com
in order to maintain and continue to grow our total gross profit.

Our arrangements with the airlines that participate in our system –
either

Name Your Own Price

®

or price-disclosed service – generally do not require the airlines to provide
any specific quantity of airline tickets or to make tickets available for any
particular route or at any particular price, and can generally be terminated
upon little or no notice.  During the
course of our business, we are in continuous dialogue with our major airline
suppliers about the nature and extent of their participation in our system. The
significant reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their
participation in our system for a sustained period of time or their complete
withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. 
Moreover, the airline industry has experienced a shift in market share
from full-service carriers to low-cost carriers that focus primarily on discount
fares to leisure destinations and we expect this trend to continue.  Some low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and
JetBlue, do not distribute their tickets through us or other third-party
intermediaries.  In addition, certain
airlines have significantly limited or eliminated sales of airline tickets
through “opaque” channels, preferring to consistently show the lowest available
price on their own website.  If one or
more participating airlines were to further limit or eliminate discounting
through opaque channels, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Due to our dependence on the airline industry, we could be severely
affected by changes in that industry, and, in many cases, we will have no
control over such changes or their timing. 
Several major U.S. airlines are struggling financially and have either
filed for reorganization under the United States Bankruptcy Code or discussed
publicly the risks of bankruptcy.

Two of our largest airline suppliers, Delta Air
Lines and Northwest Airlines, are currently operating under the protection of
federal bankruptcy laws. If any of our suppliers currently in bankruptcy
liquidates or does not emerge from bankruptcy and we are unable to replace such
supplier as a participant in priceline.com, our business would be adversely
affected. In addition, in the event that another of our major suppliers
voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy and is subsequently unable to
successfully emerge from bankruptcy, and we are unable to replace such
supplier, our business would be adversely affected.

To the extent other major U.S. airlines that
participate in our system declare bankruptcy, they may be unable or unwilling
to honor tickets sold for their flights. Our policy in such event would be to
direct customers seeking a refund or exchange to the airline, and not


to
provide a remedy ourselves. Because we are the merchant-of-record on sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets to our customers, however, we could experience a significant increase
in demands for refunds or credit card charge-backs from customers, which
could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial results. In
addition, because

Name Your Own Price

®

customers do not choose the airlines on which they are to fly, the bankruptcy
of a major U.S. airline or even the possibility of a major U.S. airline
declaring bankruptcy could discourage customers from using our

Name Your Own Price

®

system to book

airline tickets.

If one of our major airline suppliers merges or consolidates with, or
is acquired by, another company that either does not participate in the
priceline.com system or that participates on substantially lower levels, the
surviving company may elect not to participate in our system or to participate
at lower levels than the previous supplier. 
For example, in September 2005, US Airways and America West merged.  US Airways was a meaningful participant in
our

Name Your Own Price

®

system,
but America West participated on a very limited basis.  The resulting entity participates in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system,
but at lower levels than US Airways’ historical participation.  Failure of the resulting entity to
participate in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system on a meaningful basis would be the equivalent of US Airways withdrawing
from, or significantly reducing its participation in, our

Name Your Own Price

®

system and
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.  The loss of any
major airline participant in our

Name Your
Own Price

®

system could result in other major airlines
electing to terminate their participation in the

Name Your Own Price

®

system, which would further
negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition.  In addition, fewer
independent suppliers reduces opacity and competition among suppliers.  In such event, if we are unable to divert
sales to other suppliers, our business results of operations and financial
condition may be adversely affected.

In addition, given the concentration of the airline industry,
particularly in the domestic market, our competitors could exert pressure on
other airlines not to supply us with tickets. Moreover, the airlines may
attempt to establish their own buyer-driven commerce service or
participate or invest in other similar services.

We are dependent on certain hotels

.

Our financial prospects are significantly dependent upon the sale of
hotel room nights.  During the twelve
months ended December 31, 2005, sales of

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights from our five largest
hotel suppliers accounted for approximately 35% of total

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room
nights sold.  As a result, we are currently
substantially dependent upon the continued participation of these hotels in
priceline.com’s hotel service in order to maintain and continue to grow our
total gross profit.

We currently have more than 40 national hotel chains participating in
the

Name Your Own Price

®

system.  However, our arrangements with
the hotels that participate in our

Name Your
Own Price

®

system generally:

•

do not require the hotels to make available to our customers any
specific quantity of hotel rooms;

•

do not require the hotels to provide particular prices or levels of
discount;

•

do not require the hotels to deal exclusively with us in the public sale
of discounted hotel rooms; and

•

generally, can be terminated upon little or no notice.

As a general matter, during the course of our business, we are in
continuous dialogue with our major hotel suppliers about the nature and extent
of their participation in our system. 
Improving


economic
conditions are creating increased demand for hotel rooms and some hotels may
reduce the amount of inventory they sell through our service or increase the
negotiated rates at which they are willing to provide inventory.  If hotel occupancy rates improve to the point
that our hotel suppliers no longer place the same value on our distribution
systems, such suppliers may reduce the amount of inventory they make available
through priceline.com and/or our European operations.  The significant reduction on the part of any
of our major suppliers of their participation in our system for a sustained
period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our
merchant price-disclosed hotel service facilitates the purchase of hotel rooms
by customers pursuant to a retail merchant model, which is based on merchant
arrangements we make directly with individual hotel chains and independent
hotel properties. We receive access to inventory directly from a hotel at a negotiated
rate, and determine the retail price at which we will offer our services to the
consumer, within contractual limitations. 
Many hotels use merchant arrangements with companies like ours to
dispose of excess hotel room inventory at wholesale rates. If hotels experience
increased demand for rooms, they might reduce the amount of room inventory they
make available through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service.  The recent improvement in occupancy rates
discussed above could cause hotels to reduce the amount of inventory they make
available through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service.

In addition, certain hotels have begun initiatives to reduce margins
received by third party intermediaries on retail merchant transactions, which
is the primary method we employ to distribute retail hotel room
reservations.  Many hotels distribute
room inventory through their own websites and therefore might increase
negotiated rates for merchant rate inventory sold through our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service, decreasing the margin available to us.  While our merchant price-disclosed hotel agreements
with our leading hotel suppliers provide for specified discounts, if one or
more participating hotels were to require us to limit our merchant margins,
upon contract renewal or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our European operations’ business model exposes us to
certain risks that we have not traditionally experienced in the hotel business.

Our
European operations distribute hotel rooms primarily through a retail model,
whereby they secure a reservation with a customer’s credit card, but are not
compensated by the hotel property until such customer checks out of the hotel
property.  This requires our European
operations to pursue collection of commissions relating to hotel room
reservations from the hotel properties after the customer has completed his or
her stay.  We do not have extensive
experience in collecting commissions from hotel properties and failure to
sustain an adequate collection rate could negatively impact the business of our
European operations.

In
addition, our European operations rely heavily on various third parties to
distribute hotel room reservations, and our European operations’ distribution
channels are concentrated among a number of third parties.  Should one or more of such third parties
cease distribution of our European operations’ reservations, or suffer
deterioration in its search engine ranking, due to changes in search engine
algorithms or otherwise, the business of our European operations could be
negatively affected.  Similarly, a
significant amount of our European business is directed to our own websites through
participation in pay-per-click advertising campaigns on Internet search engines
whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both
technically and competitively.  If a major search engine changes its
pricing, operating or competitive dynamics in a negative manner, our business,
results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Historically,
the majority of our European operations’ business has been located in the
U.K.  The strategy of our European
operations involves rapid expansion into other European countries, many of
which have different customs, different levels of customer acceptance of the
Internet and different


legislation, regulatory environments and tax
schemes.  Compliance with foreign legal,
regulatory or tax requirements will place demands on our time and resources,
and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal,
regulatory or tax consequences.  If our
European operations are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into other European
countries, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be
adversely affected.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates.

As a result of our acquisitions of our European operations, we are
conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United
States and are reporting our results in U.S. dollars.  As a result, we face exposure to adverse
movements in currency exchange rates. 
The results of operations of our European operations are exposed to
foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our European
operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon
consolidation.  If the U.S. dollar
weakens against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net
revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss.  Similarly, our net assets, net revenues,
operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar
strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate
fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate
fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

We may lose or be subject to reduction of global
distribution system fees

.

We rely on fees paid to us by Worldspan, L.P. and other global
distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made through GDSs for a
substantial portion of our gross profit and net income. A number of travel
suppliers, particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an
effort to reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence
over time on what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as
GDSs. A number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel
distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the
GDS.  We have agreed to rebate certain
GDS costs to certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such
as those relating to inventory pricing and availability, and expect to continue
to do so in the future.  Additionally, travel
suppliers are encouraging distributors, such as us, to develop technology
enabling direct connections, therefore bypassing the GDS. Development of direct
connection technology would require the use of information technology resources
and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other
projects. We have been and believe that we will continue to be under pressure
from travel suppliers, including most of the major domestic airlines and many
of our significant hotel suppliers, to rebate all or part of the travel booking
fees we receive from GDSs like Worldspan, L.P. To the extent that we are
required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive to travel
suppliers, and are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers, or, if
one or a number of travel suppliers pull out of our service because they are
unhappy with existing distribution costs, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, some airlines are exploring
alternative global distribution methods recently developed by new entrants to
the global distribution marketplace. 
Such new entrants propose using technology that is less complex than
traditional global distribution systems, and that enables the distribution of
airline tickets in a manner that is more cost-effective to the airline
suppliers.  Our airline suppliers might
pressure us to implement such a distribution system, but our contractual
obligations to Worldspan, L.P. would limit our ability to do so during the term
of our agreement with Worldspan, L.P. 
If, as a result, any of such suppliers reduces or ceases its
participation in priceline.com, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.


Our ability to satisfy customers may be adversely
affected by a number of factors outside of our control.

Most
of our revenue is derived from the leisure travel industry, and is, therefore,
subject to increase and decrease with the level of activity in the leisure
travel industry, a factor almost entirely out of our control.  The travel industry is seasonal and our
revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter. Factors that may
adversely affect leisure travel activity include, without limitation,  economic downturns and recessions; global
security issues, political instability, acts of terrorism, civil unrest,
hostilities and war; increased airport security that could reduce the
convenience of air travel; inclement weather or natural disaster such as
hurricane, tsunami or earthquake; increased occurrence of, or widely publicized
travel-related accidents; the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic such as SARS
or avian bird flu; and the financial condition of travel suppliers.

Intense competition could reduce our market share and
harm our financial performance

.

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the services
offered on priceline.com. The market for the services we offer is intensely
competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at a
relatively low cost. In addition, the major online travel companies with which
we compete have significantly greater financial resources and capital than we
do.  For instance, the Cendant
Corporation currently owns Orbitz.com, Inc., Cheaptickets.com, Lodging.com and
European travel sites Gullivers.com, ebookers plc and octopustravel, and Sabre
Group owns Travelocity.com and lastminute.com plc, a European full-service
travel site.  In addition, InterActive
recently spun-off its online travel business, including Hotels.com and
Hotwire.com, our primary competitor in the sale of “opaque” travel services,
into Expedia, which, as a stand-alone company, continues to have significantly
greater resources and capital than priceline.com.  We may not be able to effectively compete
with industry conglomerates such as Cendant, Sabre or Expedia, each of which
have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do.

We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies with
respect to each service we offer. With respect to our travel services, these
competitors include:

•

Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and
Hotwire, which are owned by Expedia; Travelocity and lastminute.com, which are
owned by the Sabre Group; and Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, Gullivers.com, ebookers
plc, octopustravel and Lodging.com, which are currently owned by the Cendant
Corporation;

•

travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and
rental car companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which
they drive business;

•

large online search companies, such as Yahoo! and Google;

•

traditional travel agencies;

•

online
travel search sites such as SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com, Cheapflights.com, FareChase.com,
Kayak.com, or any substantially similar online travel search business using a
business model sometimes referred to as “meta-search”; and

•

operators of travel industry reservation databases such
as Galileo, Worldspan, L.P. and Amadeus.


Competitors of our European operations include, among others, Expedia
(including hotels.com), Cendant Corporation (including ebookers, octopustravel,
Gullivers.com and Fairview), Sabre Group (including lastminute.com),
Superbreak, Venere and Hotel Reservation Service.

In addition, many airline, hotel and rental car suppliers are focusing
on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own
website.  Furthermore, many low cost
airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute
their inventory exclusively through their own websites.  Suppliers who sell on their own websites
typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer
advantages such as bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their
offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.

We potentially face competition from a number of large Internet
companies and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and in
facilitating Internet traffic, including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and
Yahoo!, which compete with us either directly or indirectly through
affiliations with other e-commerce or off-line companies.  We also compete with “meta-search” companies,
which are companies that leverage their search technology to aggregate travel
search results across supplier, travel agent and other websites.  For example, Yahoo! owns FareChase.com, a
travel search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates at travel supplier
and third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites, and AOL is party to
a marketing and technology agreement, and holds a minority interest in,
Kayak.com, another leading meta-search company. 
Other established search engine companies as well as start-ups are
attempting to enter the online travel marketplace in this manner.  If Yahoo!, Google or other portals decide to
refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could result in more
competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition costs for
third-party sites such as ours. 
Competition from these and other sources could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many of our current and potential competitors, including Internet
directories, search engines and large traditional retailers, have longer
operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and
significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel, technical and other
resources than priceline.com. Some of these competitors may be able to secure
products and services on more favorable terms than we can. In addition, many of
these competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to:

•

marketing and
promotional campaigns;

•

attracting traffic to
their websites;

•

attracting and retaining
key employees;

•

securing vendors and
inventory; and

•

website and systems
development.

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss
of market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that
competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Our business could be negatively affected by changes
in search engine algorithms and dynamics.

We
utilize Internet search engines, principally through the purchase of
travel-related keywords, to generate traffic to our websites.  Our European operations, in particular, rely
to a significant extent upon third-party distribution partners that derive
substantial business from search engines. 
Within the past year, at least one major search engine changed the logic
which determines the placement and display of


results of a user’s search, such that the
placement of links to our sites, and particularly those of our European
operations and their affiliates, was negatively affected.  In a similar way, a significant amount of our
European business is directed to our own websites through participation in pay-per-click
advertising campaigns on Internet search engines whose pricing and operating
dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and competitively.
 If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that further
negatively affects the search engine ranking of us or our third-party
distribution partners or changes its pricing, operating or competitive dynamics
in a negative manner, our business, results of operations and financial
condition would be adversely affected.

Defending against intellectual property claims could
be expensive and disruptive to our business.

From
time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we have been subject to,
and are currently subject to, legal proceedings and claims relating to the
intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will
continue to assert intellectual property claims, in particular patent claims,
against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business.  We endeavor to defend our intellectual
property rights diligently, but intellectual property litigation is extremely
expensive and time consuming, and has and is likely to continue to divert
managerial attention and resources from our business objectives.  Successful infringement claims against us
could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our
business, or portions of our business. 
In addition, resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to
use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties, which may be
expensive to procure, or possibly to cease using those rights altogether.  Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Acquisitions could result in operating
difficulties.

As part of our business strategy, in September 2004, we acquired Active
Hotels and, in July 2005, Bookings.  We
may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future.  Acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances
of equity securities, use of our cash resources, incurrence of debt and
amortization of expenses related to intangible assets acquired.  In addition, the process of integrating an
acquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties
and expenditures.  The acquisitions of
Active Hotels and Bookings were accompanied by a number of risks, including,
without limitation:

•

t

he need
to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a
larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such
controls, procedures and policies;

•

the
difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of Active Hotels and
Bookings, which are principally located in Cambridge, England, and Amsterdam,
The Netherlands, respectively, with and into our operations, which are
headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut;

•

the
potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;

•

the
difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our services
and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;

•

the
failure to further successfully develop acquired technology resulting in the
impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;

•

the
impairment of relationships with customers of Active Hotels, Bookings or our
own customers as a result of any integration of operations;

•

the
impairment of relationships with employees of Active Hotels, Bookings or our
own business as a result of any integration of new management personnel;

•

the
potential unknown liabilities associated with Active Hotels or Bookings.


We may experience similar risks in connection with any future
acquisitions. We may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other
problems encountered in connection with the acquisitions of Active Hotels and
Bookings or that we could encounter in future acquisitions, which would harm
our business or cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our
acquisitions.  We currently have
approximately $303 million assigned primarily to the intangible assets and
goodwill of Active Hotels and Bookings, and therefore, the occurrence of any of
the aforementioned risks could result in a material adverse impact, including a
material impairment of these assets, which could cause us to have to write-down
goodwill.  Any such write-down of
goodwill could adversely impact our operating results, which would cause our
stock price to decline significantly.

Our growth cannot be assured. Even if we do
experience growth, we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably

.

Our business strategies are dependent on the growth of our business.
For us to achieve significant growth, consumers and travel suppliers must
continue to accept our website as a valuable commercial tool. Consumers who
have historically purchased travel services using traditional commercial
channels, such as local travel agents and calling suppliers directly, must
instead purchase these services on our website. Similarly, travel suppliers
will also need to accept or expand their use of our website and view our
website as an efficient and profitable channel of distribution for their travel
products. Our ability to enhance awareness of the priceline.com brands and
offer services that will attract and retain a significant number of new
consumers and travel suppliers is not certain, and therefore, our growth may be
limited.

We may not be able to keep up with rapid
technological and other changes.

The
markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology,
evolving industry standards, consolidation, frequent new service and product
announcements, introductions and enhancements and changing consumer demands. We
may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes. In addition, these market
characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the Internet and the
apparent need of companies from many industries to offer Internet-based
products and services. As a result, our future success will depend on our
ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to
evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance,
features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and
product offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace. In addition, the
widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications
technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur
substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure.

Online or internal security
breaches could harm our business.

The secure transmission of confidential
information over the Internet is essential in maintaining consumer and supplier
confidence in the priceline.com services. Substantial or ongoing security
breaches whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other
Internet-based systems could significantly harm our business. We
currently require buyers to guarantee their offers with their credit card,
either online or through our toll-free telephone service. We rely on licensed
encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of
confidential information, including credit card numbers from and to our
customers. It is possible that advances in computer circumvention capabilities,
new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of
customer transaction data.

We incur substantial expense
to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences. However,
we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party)
that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal customer
transaction data, proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in
our operations. For instance, several major websites have experienced
significant interruptions as a result of improper direction of excess traffic
to those sites, and computer viruses have


substantially disrupted e-mail and other functionality in a number of
countries, including the United States. Security breaches also could damage our
reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible
liability. Security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers
to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the
value of our brand.  Our insurance
policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us
for losses caused by security breaches.

Companies that we have acquired, such as our European operations, and
that we may acquire in the future, may employ security and networking standards
at levels we find unsatisfactory.  The process of enhancing infrastructure
to attain improved security and network standards may be time consuming and
expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to
obtain.  Such acquisitions increase the number of potential vulnerabilities,
and can cause delays in detection of an attack, as well as the timelines of
recovery from any given attack. Failure to raise any such standards that we
find unsatisfactory could expose us to security breaches that would have an
adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third
parties conducting business over the Internet. Consumers generally are
concerned with security and privacy on the Internet, and any publicized
security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet and, therefore, the
priceline.com service as a means of conducting commercial transactions.

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give
rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal
requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.

In
our processing of travel transactions, we receive and store a large volume of
personally identifiable data.  This data
is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous
jurisdictions around the world, including the Commission of the European Union
through its Data Protection Directive and variations of that directive in the
member states of the European Union. 
This government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of
personal data that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the
governing jurisdiction.  We could be
adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require
changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or
implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

In
addition, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in
the United States, government agencies have been contemplating or developing
initiatives to enhance national and aviation security, including the
Transportation Security Administration’s Computer-Assisted Passenger
Prescreening System, known as CAPPS II. 
These initiatives may result in conflicting legal requirements with
respect to data handling.  As privacy and
data protection has become a more sensitive issue, we may also become exposed
to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of
travel data.  Travel businesses have also
been subjected to investigations, lawsuits and adverse publicity due to
allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information.  These and other privacy developments that are
difficult to anticipate could adversely impact our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We rely on the value of the
priceline.com brand, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our

brand awareness are increasing.

We
believe that maintaining and expanding the priceline.com brand, and other owned
brands, including Lowestfare.com, Rentalcars.com, Breezenet.com,
MyTravelGuide.com, Travelweb, Active Hotels and Bookings, are important aspects
of our efforts to attract and expand our user and advertiser base.  As our larger competitors spend increasingly
more on advertising, we are required to spend more in order to maintain our
brand recognition.  Promotion of the
priceline.com brand will depend largely on our success in satisfying our
customers. In addition, we have spent considerable money and resources to date


on the establishment and maintenance of the
priceline.com brands, and we will continue to spend money on, and devote
resources to advertising, marketing and other brand-building efforts to
preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the priceline.com brands. We may not
be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of the
priceline.com brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts,
such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain or enhance
customer awareness of the priceline.com brands in a cost-effective manner, our
business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash to repay
or repurchase our $225 million Convertible Senior Notes and the Notes could
result in dilution to our earnings per share.

In August 2003, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible
Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1% (the “1% Notes”)
and in June 2004, we issued $100 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025, with an interest rate of 2.25%
(the “2.25% Notes”, and collectively with the 1% Notes, the “Notes”).  The
holders of the 1% Notes may require us to repurchase the notes on August 1,
2008 and the holders of the 2.25% Notes may require us to repurchase the notes
on January 15, 2010, 2015 or 2020.  It is possible that we may not have
sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay
the principal amount or repurchase price due.  We are increasingly reliant
on our European operations as a source of cash flow and in the event we are required
to repay or repurchase the notes, we would likely incur expenses to repatriate
such cash to the United States.  If we are unable to repurchase, repay or
refinance the Notes when due, we would be in default under our indentures and
our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely
affected.

In the event that all or substantially all of our common stock is
acquired prior to January 15, 2010, in a transaction in which the consideration
paid to holders of our common stock consists of all, or substantially all,
cash, we would be required to make additional payments to the holders of the
2.25% Notes of amounts ranging from $0 to $17.6 million depending upon the date
of the transaction and our then current stock price.

Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
Earnings per Share,” (“EITF 04-08”) contingently convertible debt, such as the
Notes, must be included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether
the market price contingency contained in the debt instrument has been
met.  EITF 04-08 could result in a material reduction in our diluted
earnings per share in future periods.  See Notes 8 and 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of Net Income Per Share and
Convertible Debt, respectively.

Our success depends on our ability to protect our
intellectual property.

We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success, and we
rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and
confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers,
partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. If we are not successful
in protecting our intellectual property, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

While we believe that our issued patents and pending patent
applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance that:

•

any patent can be
successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

•

pending patent
applications will result in the issuance of patents;

•

competitors or potential
competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of competing with us
that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;


•

because of variations in
the application of our business model to each of our services, our patents will
be effective in preventing one or more third parties from utilizing a copycat
business model to offer the same service in one or more categories;

•

new prior art will not
be discovered which may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent;

•

a third party will not
have or obtain one or more patents that prevent us from practicing features of
our business or require us to pay for a license to use those features; or

•

our operations do not or will not infringe
valid, enforceable patents of third parties.

There has been recent discussion in the press regarding the examination
and issuance of so called “business-method” patents. As a result, the
United States Patent and Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to
intensify the review process applicable to such patent applications. The new
procedures are not expected to have a direct effect on patents already granted.
We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will have on
our pending patent applications.

We pursue the registration of our trademarks
and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. However, effective
trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be
available in every country in which our services are made available online. We
have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our
proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third
parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our
proprietary rights or harm our reputation.

Our business is dependent upon third-party
systems and service providers.

We rely on certain third-party computer systems and third-party
service providers, including the computerized central reservation systems of
the airline, hotel and rental car industries to satisfy demand for airline
tickets, hotel room and rental car reservations. In particular, our travel
business is substantially dependent upon the computerized reservation systems
of operators of global distribution systems for the travel industry. Any
interruption in these third-party services systems or deterioration in
their performance could prevent us from booking airline, hotel and rental car
reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Our agreements
with third-party service providers are terminable upon short notice and
often do not provide recourse for service interruptions. In the event our
arrangement with any of such third parties is terminated, we may not be able to
find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially
reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A substantial portion of our computer hardware for operating our
services is currently located at a web hosting facility operated by
SAVVIS.  If SAVVIS is, for any reason,
unable to support our website, we would need to quickly complete the activation
of our secondary site at the AT&T web hosting facility.  Any of these conditions could cause
disruptions to our business or exposure to potentially damaging press coverage
of the problems, and would have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Our communications infrastructure is provided by vendors such as
AT&T, MCI, IX EUROPE and MCI Worldcom B.V. 
If they are unable, for any reason, to support the communications
infrastructure they provide us, instabilities in our systems could increase
until such time as we were able to replace their services.

While we do maintain redundant systems and hosting services for some of
our business, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our
business, and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to
compensate us for losses that may occur.


Capacity constraints and system failures could harm
our business.

We rely primarily on the global distribution system of Worldspan, L.P.
in the sale of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations, and rental car
reservations, and the global distribution system of Pegasus Solutions in the
sale of retail hotel room reservations. 
If the Worldspan, L.P. or Pegasus GDS becomes inaccessible, or partially
inaccessible to us, due to system failure or otherwise, for any significant
amount of time, our ability to book airline tickets, opaque and retail hotel
reservations and rental car reservations could be adversely affected, in which
case our results would suffer.  We also
depend upon Paymentech to process our credit card transactions. If Paymentech
was wholly or partially compromised, our cash flows could be disrupted until
such a time as a replacement process could be put in place with a different
vendor.

A substantial amount of our computer hardware for operating our
services is currently located at the facilities of SAVVIS in New Jersey, IX
EUROPE in London, England, Telecity Netherlands and Redbus Interhouse
Netherlands. These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from human error, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication
failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage,
intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite any precautions
we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated
problems at the SAVVIS facility, the IX EUROPE facility or the Netherlands
facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition,
the failure by SAVVIS, IX EUROPE or MCI Worldcom B.V. to provide our required
data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. Any
system failure that causes an interruption in service or decreases the
responsiveness of the priceline.com service could impair our reputation, damage
our brand name and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

If our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or
fails to perform, we could experience:

•

unanticipated
disruptions in service;

•

slower response times;

•

decreased customer
service and customer satisfaction; or

•

delays in the
introduction of new products and services,

any of which could impair our reputation, damage the
priceline.com brand and materially and adversely affect our revenues. Publicity
about a service disruption also could cause a material decline in our stock
price.

Like many online businesses, we have experienced system failures from
time to time. For example, in May 2001, our primary website was
interrupted for a period of 12 hours. In addition to placing increased
burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of
user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support
personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate
loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to switch to
our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system failures, our
reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. We have been taking steps to
increase the reliability and redundancy of our system. These steps are
expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the
frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.

We use both internally developed systems and third-party systems to
operate the priceline.com service, including transaction processing, order
management and financial systems that were designed to be scaleable and stable.
However, if the number of users of our services increases substantially, or if
critical third-party systems stop operating as designed, we will need to
significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing
systems, financial systems and other infrastructure. We do not


know
whether we will be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to
accommodate such conditions in a timely manner.

Companies that we have acquired, such as our European operations, and
that we may acquire in the future, may present known or unknown
capacity/stability or other types of system challenges.  The process of
enhancing infrastructure to attain improved capacity/scalability and other
system characteristics may be time consuming and expensive and may require
resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.  Such acquisitions
increase potential downtime, customer facing problems and compliance
problems.  Failure to successfully make
any such improvements to such infrastructures could expose us to potential
capacity, stability, and system problems that would have an adverse impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes

We file tax returns in such states as required by law based on
principles applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we pay sales and
other taxes, including hotel occupancy taxes, to suppliers related to travel
services sold through the priceline.com service.  We believe that this
practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions. On an ongoing
basis, we conduct a review and interpretation of the tax laws in various states
and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and local hotel
occupancy and other related taxes.  In connection with our review, we have
met and had discussions with taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions but
the ultimate resolution in any particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at
this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel occupancy and
related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts collected by
the hotels. Consistent with this practice, we recover the taxes on the
underlying cost of the hotel room night from customers and pay that amount to
the hotel operators for payment to the appropriate tax authorities.  As
discussed in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements, several
jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits indicating the position that sales or
hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by
a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room. Historically,
we have not collected taxes on this differential. Additional state and local
jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or hotel occupancy
taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either
retroactively or prospectively or both. A number of proposals have been made at
state and local levels that could impose additional taxes on the sale of
products and services through the Internet or the income derived from these
sales. Such actions may result in substantial tax liabilities for past and/or
future sales and could have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in
asserting that any such tax collection responsibility exists, it is likely
that, with respect to future transactions, we would collect any such additional
tax obligation from our customers, which would have the effect of increasing
the cost of hotel room nights to our customers and, consequently, could reduce
our hotel sales. We will continue to assess the risks of the potential
financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, we
will reserve for those estimated liabilities.

Current economic conditions in the United States are triggering active
consideration on ways to generate additional tax revenues by both the federal
and state and local governments. We cannot predict what changes in tax law or
interpretations of such laws may be adopted or assure that such changes or
interpretations would not materially impact our business.

Our business is exposed to risks associated with
credit card fraud and charge-backs.

To date, our results have been negatively impacted by purchases made
using fraudulent credit cards. Because we act as the merchant-of-record in a
majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent
credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with our
customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit
cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of
record.  Accordingly, we calculate and
record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs.  If we are unable to combat the use of
fraudulent credit cards on our website, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.


Two large stockholders beneficially own approximately
31% of our stock.

Hutchison Whampoa Limited
and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, which is a 49.97% shareholder of Hutchison
Whampoa Limited, owned approximately 31% of our outstanding common stock as of
December 31, 2005, and have the right to appoint three representatives to our
Board of Directors.  Ian F. Wade and
Dominic Kai Ming Lai are Hutchison Whampoa Limited’s representatives on our
Board of Directors.  Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited currently has no representative on our Board of Directors,
however, it retains its right to appoint an additional director in the future.  These stockholders could exert significant
influence over us and our strategic direction, and deter or prevent certain
fundamental transactions involving our company.

In June 2000, we entered
into definitive agreements with subsidiaries of Hutchison Whampoa Limited to
introduce our services to several Asian markets.  Under the terms of the agreements we license
our business model and provide our expertise in technology, marketing and
operations to Hutchison-Priceline Limited. 
Hutchison-Priceline Limited reimburses us for the cost of services
provided and is required to pay us a licensing fee for any year in which
Hutchison-Priceline Limited achieves profitability.  We and Hutchison Whampoa Limited currently
own approximately 15% and 85%, respectively, of the outstanding equity
securities of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. 
Jeffery H. Boyd, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is
priceline.com’s representative on the board of directors of Hutchison-Priceline
Limited.

In May 2004, we filed a
shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
covering up to 10 million shares of priceline.com common stock held by
Hutchison Whampoa Limited and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited.  Any sale of a significant number of shares by
these stockholders could cause our stock price to decline significantly.

Fluctuations in our financial results make quarterly
comparisons and financial forecasting difficult.

Our
revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to
quarter because our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, which reflect
seasonal trends for the travel services offered by our websites. Traditional
leisure travel bookings in the United States are higher in the second and third
calendar quarters of the year as consumers take spring and summer vacations. In
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year, demand for travel services
in the United States generally declines and the number of bookings
flattens.  Travel revenues in Europe, on the other hand, have been higher
in the third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters. 
Furthermore, prior to introducing a retail travel option to our customers,
substantially all of our business was conducted under the

Name Your Own Price

®

system and
accordingly, because those services are non-refundable in nature, we recognize
travel revenue at the time a booking was generated.  We recognize revenue
generated from our retail hotel service, however, including our European
operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a
result, we have seen and expect to continue to see, that a meaningful amount of
retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and
reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized until future quarters. 
This could result in a disproportionate amount of our annual earnings being
recognized in later quarters.

Our
results may also be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the inventory made
available to us by airlines, hotels and rental car suppliers. Our revenues and
operating results may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter
because of these factors. As a result, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our
revenues and operating results may not be meaningful. In addition, due to our limited
operating history, a relatively new and unproven business model and an
uncertain environment in the travel industry, it may be difficult to predict
our future revenues or results of operations.

Because
of these fluctuations and uncertainties, our operating results may fail to meet
the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the
trading price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially
adversely affected.


If we lose our key personnel or cannot recruit
additional personnel, our business may suffer.

We
depend on the continued services and performance of our executive officers and
other key personnel. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and
skills with respect to priceline.com and our operations. We do not have “key
person” life insurance policies. Our ability to retain key employees could be
materially adversely affected by the decline in the market price of our common
stock, limitations on our ability to pay cash compensation that is equivalent
to cash paid by traditional businesses or, in some instances, larger or better
capitalized competitors, and limitations imposed by our employee benefit plans
on our ability to issue additional equity incentives. If we do not succeed in
attracting new employees or retaining and motivating current and future
employees or executive officers, our business could suffer significantly.

The adoption by FASB of FASB Statement No. 123
(Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS 123(R)”) will negatively impact
our reported business results

.

As more fully discussed in
Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we were required to adopt SFAS
123(R) as of January 1, 2006.  SFAS
123(R) will have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statement of Operations
as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants
rather than disclose the pro forma impact on our consolidated operations within
our footnotes.  Upon adoption of SFAS
123(R), the impact of unvested stock options outstanding as of December 31,
2005 is estimated to increase personnel expense by approximately $6.0 million
in 2006, $2.5 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008.

Our financial results will be materially impacted by
income taxes in the future.

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of
approximately $156 million.  This
principally resulted from a non-cash tax benefit recorded in the third quarter
of 2005 of $171 million, relating to the reversal of a portion of our valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets. The non-cash tax benefit was recorded
pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, that require a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset
valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize
all or some portion of its deferred tax assets. Due to our significant net
operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S.
federal taxable income for the foreseeable future.  As a result of the reversal, we recorded a
mostly non-cash $12.5 million provision for U.S. income tax expense in our
consolidated financial statements in 2005, and will continue to record a
non-cash provision for U.S. income tax expense in future periods.  This non-cash U.S. income tax provision will
materially negatively impact net income and earnings per share in subsequent
periods as compared to prior periods.  
We expect to make cash tax payments for U.S. alternative minimum taxes
and for certain international taxes.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely
to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as
the following, some of which are beyond our control:

•

quarterly variations in
our operating results;

•

operating results that
vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

•

changes in expectations
as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by
securities analysts and investors;

•

changes in our capital
structure;

•

changes in market
valuations of other Internet or online service companies;


•

announcements of
technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;

•

announcements by us or
our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships,
joint ventures or capital commitments;

•

loss of a major supplier
participant, such as an airline or hotel chain;

•

changes in the status of
our intellectual property rights;

•

lack of success in the
expansion of our business model geographically;

•

announcements by third
parties of significant claims or proceedings against us or adverse developments
in pending proceedings;

•

additions or departures
of key personnel; and

•

stock market price and
volume fluctuations.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could
adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing a large
number of sellers to the market. Given the volatility that exists for our
shares, such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline
significantly. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our
price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum,
hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks
rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when
viewed on a quarterly basis.

The trading prices of Internet company stocks in general, including
ours, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. To the extent
that the public’s perception of the prospects of Internet or e-commerce
companies is negative, our stock price could decline further, regardless of our
results. Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price
of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Market
fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions, such as a
recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, also may decrease the
market price of our common stock. 
Negative market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise
additional capital.

We are defendants in a number of securities class action litigations.
In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against
a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its
securities. To the extent our stock price declines or is volatile, we may in
the future be the target of additional litigation. This additional litigation
could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and
resources.

We are party to legal
proceedings which, if adversely decided, could materially adversely affect us.

We are a party to the legal proceedings described
in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The defense of the actions described in Note
19 may increase our expenses and an adverse outcome in any of such actions
could

have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition

.

Regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our
business.

The products and services we offer through the priceline.com service
are regulated by federal and state governments. Our ability to provide such
products and services is and will continue to be affected by such regulations.
The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of
existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur
significant compliance costs, cause the development of the affected markets to
become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.  See “

Uncertainty

Item 3.  Legal
Proceedings

Litigation
Related to Hotel Occupancy and Other Taxes

On
December 30, 2004, the City of Los Angeles filed a putative class action
complaint in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, on behalf of itself
and other allegedly similarly situated cities in California, naming as
defendants:  Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotel.com
GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Cendant Travel Distribution
Services Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a
Lodging.com); Lowestfare.com, Inc.; Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.;
Orbitz, LLC; priceline.com, Inc.; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.;
Travelocity.com LP; Travelweb, LLC and Travelnow.com, Inc.  (

City of Los Angeles v. Hotels.com, Inc.
et al

.).  The complaint alleged,
among other things, that each of these defendants violated the Uniform
Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, and allegedly
similar ordinances of other California cities, with respect to the charges and
remittance of amounts to cover taxes under such ordinances, and that such
practices also constitute acts of unfair competition under California Business
and Professions Code Section 17200,

et seq

.
(“Section 17200”).  On May 19, 2005, the
court ordered limited discovery.  On
August 31, 2005, the City of Los Angeles filed an amended complaint adding a
claim for a declaratory judgment.  The
amended complaint sought payment of alleged unpaid taxes owed, relief from
conversion, including punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and imposition of a
constructive trust.  On September 26,
2005, the court sustained the defendants’ demurrers on the ground of improper
joinder of defendants and claims, and therefore, dismissed the amended
complaint, with leave to file amended complaint further addressing the joinder
issue.  On February 8, 2006, the City of
Los Angeles filed a second amended complaint that asserts the same claims but
includes additional allegations of fact. 
Defendants intend to demurrer to the second amended complaint.

On
February 17, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the same
court by Ronald Bush and three other individuals on behalf of themselves and
other allegedly similarly situated California


consumers against several of the same
defendants as named in the City of Los Angeles action, including priceline.com
(

Bush, et al. v. Cheaptickets, Inc., et al

.).  The complaint alleged each of the defendants
engaged in acts of unfair competition in violation of Section 17200 relating to
their respective disclosures and charges to customers to cover taxes under the
above ordinances of the City of Los Angeles and other California cities, and
service fees.  The complaint sought
restitution under Section 17200, relief for alleged conversion, including
punitive damages, injunctive relief, and imposition of a constructive
trust.  The defendants removed this
action to the United States District Court for the Central District of
California.  On May 9, 2005, the District
Court issued an order remanding the action to state court.  Defendants timely appealed to the Ninth
Circuit, which, on October 6, 2005, affirmed the order of the District
Court.  The case will therefore proceed
in the state court.  On July 1, 2005,
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding claims pursuant to California’s
Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code §1750,

et
seq

. and claims for breach of contract and the implied duty of good
faith and fair dealing.  On December 2,
2005, the court ordered limited discovery and ordered that motions challenging
the amended complaint would be coordinated with any similar motions filed in
the

City of Los Angeles

action.

Also
on February 17, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware for New Castle County by Jeanne
Marshall and three other individuals on behalf of themselves and a putative
class of allegedly similarly situated consumers nationwide against priceline.com
(

Marshall, et al. v. priceline.com, Inc

.).  The complaint alleged that we violated the
Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 2511,

et seq

., relating to our disclosures and
charges to customers to cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances
nationwide, and service fees.  We moved
to dismiss the complaint on April 21, 2005. 
We also moved to stay discovery until a determination of our motion to
dismiss the complaint and the Court granted that stay on May 11, 2005.  On June 10, 2005, Plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint that asserts claims under the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act and for
breach of contract and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.  The amended complaint seeks compensatory
damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other relief.  On July 15, 2005, we filed a motion to
dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that it fails to allege sufficient
facts to state a cause of action.  Our
motion to dismiss was heard by the Court on November 4, 2005 and the parties
are awaiting a decision.

On July 12, 2005, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a
complaint in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania
against Hotels.com; Hotels.com GP, LLC; Hotwire.com; Cheaptickets, Inc.;

Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; Travelweb, LLC and Travelnow.com,
Inc.  (

.). 
The complaint alleged, among other things, that each of these defendants
violated the hotel room rental tax provisions of Section 19-2401,

et seq

., of the Philadelphia Municipal
Code with respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes under
the Code.  The complaint also asserted
claims for conversion, imposition of a constructive trust, and a demand for a
legal accounting.  The complaint sought
payment of alleged unpaid taxes owed, disgorgement and restitution of all funds
allegedly owed to Plaintiff, an accounting, attorneys’ fees, and other
relief.  The defendants removed this
action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania.  On October 11, 2005, the
District Court issued an order remanding the action to state court.  On November 18, 2005, the City of Philadelphia
filed an amended complaint.  On December
8, 2005, the defendants filed preliminary objections to the amended complaint,
and on January 9, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to determine those
preliminary objections.  That motion has
been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting a decision.  On January 17, 2006, the Court granted the
defendants’ motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the preliminary
objections.


On September 21, 2005, the City of Bellingham, Washington filed a
putative class action complaint in the Superior Court of Washington for Whatcom

under the Municipal Code.  The complaint
also asserted claims for violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act
RCW § 19.86.010,

et seq

., conversion and unjust
enrichment.  The complaint sought
compensatory damages, statutory treble damages, penalties, attorneys’ fees and
other relief.  On November 3, 2005, priceline.com,
Lowestfare.com, Travelweb and certain other defendants removed this action to
the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington.  On January 10, 2006, the defendants moved to
dismiss the complaint.  On January 17,
2006, the City of Bellingham filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on MultidistrictLitigation
seeking transfer and coordination of this action with certain other actions
pending in federal court elsewhere.  That
motion, which was subsequently withdrawn, is discussed in further detail
below.  On February 16, 2006, the City of
Bellingham, with the agreement of the defendants, voluntarily moved to dismiss
the action.  The court granted that
motion and dismissed the action on February 17, 2006.

In the alternative, Plaintiffs sought transfer to the United States
District Courts for the Western District of Washington or Northern District of
Georgia.  On February 6, 2006, we and
certain other defendants in the cases for which consolidation was sought filed
their opposition to the motion for transfer and coordination.  On February 10, 2006, the plaintiffs moved to
withdraw their motion for transfer and consolidation.

On
February 9, 2006, the City of San Diego, California filed a complaint in
Superior Court for the County of San Diego against Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com
GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheap Tickets, Inc.; Cendant Travel Distribution
Services Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a
Lodging.com); Lowestfare.com, Inc.; Maupintour Holding, LLC; Orbitz, Inc.;
Orbitz, LLC; priceline.com, Inc.; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.;
Travelocity.com, L.P.; Travelweb, LLC; Travelnow.com, Inc. and Does 1 through
1000.  (

City of San Diego, California,
v. Hotels.com L.P., et al

.)  The
complaint alleges, among other things, that each of these defendants violated
the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of San Diego with
respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes under that
ordinance, and that such practices also constitute acts of unfair competition
under Section 17200.  The complaint seeks
payment of alleged unpaid taxes owed, relief from conversion, including
punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, imposition of a constructive trust, and a
declaratory judgment.  We and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries, Lowestfare.com Inc. and Travelweb LLC, have been
served with the complaint but have not yet responded to the complaint.

We
intend to defend vigorously against the claims in all of the aforementioned
proceedings.  We are unable at this time
to predict the outcome of these proceedings or reasonably estimate a range of
possible loss, if any.

Litigation
Related to Securities Matters

On
March 16, March 26, April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four putative
class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay
Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ.
3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other
defendants and states claims unrelated to priceline.com.  The complaints allege, among other things,
that we and the individual defendants violated the federal securities laws by
issuing and selling priceline.com common stock in our March 1999 initial public
offering without disclosing to investors that some of the underwriters in the
offering, including the lead underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received
excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors.  By Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge
Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these cases were consolidated for pre-trial
purposes with hundreds of other cases, which contain allegations concerning the
allocation of shares in the initial public offerings of companies other than
priceline.com.  By Order of Judge
Scheindlin dated August 14, 2001, the following cases were consolidated for all
purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576;
and 01 Civ. 3590.  On April 19, 2002,
plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these
cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class
Action Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with
respect to both our March 1999 initial public offering and our August 1999
second public offering of common stock. 
The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay
S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman, Timothy G. Brier, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest to
BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  Priceline,
Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier,
together with other issuer defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a
joint motion to dismiss on July 15, 2002. 
On November 18, 2002, the cases against the individual defendants were
dismissed without prejudice and without costs. 
In addition, counsel for plaintiffs and the individual defendants
executed Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes
of limitations on plaintiffs’ claims against those individuals.  On February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin issued
an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the


issuer’s motion.  None of the claims against priceline.com were
dismissed.  On June 26, 2003, counsel for
the plaintiff class announced that they and counsel for the issuers had agreed
to the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to settle
claims against the issuers.  The terms of
that Memorandum provide that class members will be guaranteed $1 billion in
recoveries by the insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants
will assign to the class members certain claims that they may have against the
underwriters.  Issuers also agree to
limit their abilities to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion are
obtained by the class from any non-settling defendants, the settling defendants’
monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount
recovered from the underwriters that is less than $1 billion will be paid by
the insurers on behalf of the issuers. 
The Memorandum, which is subject to the approval of each issuer, was
approved by a special committee of the priceline.com Board of Directors on
Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Thereafter,
counsel for the plaintiff class and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form
of a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and
Individuals (“Settlement Agreement”). 
The Settlement Agreement implements the Memorandum and contains the same
material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a
special committee of the priceline.com Board of Directors authorized our
counsel to execute the Settlement Agreement on our behalf.  The Settlement Agreement is subject to final
approval by the Court and the process to obtain that approval is still pending.

Subsequent to our announcement on September 27, 2000, that revenues for
the third quarter 2000 would not meet expectations, we were served with the
following putative class action complaints:


All of these cases have been assigned to Judge
Dominic J. Squatrito.  On September 12,
2001, Judge Squatrito ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master
File No. 3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’
counsel.  On October 29, 2001, plaintiffs
served a Consolidated Amended Complaint. 
On February 5, 2002, Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., who was one of
the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action, made a motion for leave to
withdraw as lead plaintiff.  The Court
granted that motion on May 30, 2002.  On
February 28, 2002, we filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended
Complaint.  On October 7, 2004, the Court
issued a Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying, in part, our
motion.  An initial scheduling order was
entered by the Court on November 2, 2004 and the parties are now proceeding
with discovery.  Plaintiffs filed a
motion for class certification on January 7, 2005, and we have filed our
opposition to that motion.  We intend to
defend vigorously against this action. 
We are unable to predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably
estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

In addition, on November 1, 2000, we were served with a
complaint that purported to be a shareholder derivative action against our
Board of Directors and certain of our current and former executive officers, as
well as

priceline.com

(as a nominal defendant).  The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary
duty and waste of corporate assets.  The
action is captioned

Mark Zimmerman v. Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D.
Schulman, P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney, W. Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N.
Peretsman, and priceline.com Incorporated, 18473-NC (Court of Chancery of
Delaware, County of New Castle, State of Delaware).  On February 6, 2001, all defendants moved to
dismiss the complaint for failure to make a demand upon the Board of Directors
and failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can be


granted. 
Pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, an amended complaint was filed
on June 21, 2001.  Defendants renewed
their motion to dismiss on August 20, 2001. 
On December 20, 2002, the Court granted defendants’ motion without
prejudice.  On April 25, 2003, a second
amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was filed and a motion seeking leave of
court to file the second amended complaint was filed on July 28, 2003.  That motion was fully briefed, and oral
argument took place on May 9, 2005. Immediately following oral argument, the
Court dismissed three of the four counts in the second amended complaint.  All of the counts against defendants Allaire,
Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller, Peretsman and Schulman have now been
dismissed.  On September 8, 2005, the
Court granted plaintiff leave to file the second amended complaint as to the
one remaining count.  Defendants filed a
motion requesting that the Court certify its September 8, 2005 order for
interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, and the Court granted that
motion on October 6, 2005.  On October
17, 2005, the Delaware Supreme Court accepted the interlocutory appeal.  The appeal was fully briefed, and oral
argument took place on February 22, 2006. 
Discovery in the case and the time in which Defendants are required to
respond to the second amended complaint have been stayed pending the Delaware
Supreme Court’s entry of mandate.   We
intend to defend vigorously against this action.  We are unable to predict the outcome of the
suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On
November 7, 2003, we were served with a complaint that purported to be a
shareholder derivative action against our Board of Directors and certain of our
current and former executive officers, as well as

priceline.com

(as a nominal defendant).  The
complaint alleged, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of
corporate assets and misappropriation of corporate information.

The claims in the complaint appear to
be substantially repetitive of the claims pending in the derivative action in
Delaware which is described above.

The action is captioned Don Powell

v.
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph
M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney, William E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas,
Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and Heidi G. Miller and priceline.com Incorporated
(Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford/Norwalk, State of
Connecticut).  On January 28, 2004,
defendants Blackney, Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb moved to dismiss the
complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
On January 29, 2004, defendant Miller moved to dismiss the complaint for
lack of personal jurisdiction and for insufficient service of process.  On February 27, 2004, defendants Braddock,
Walker, Schulman, Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Loeb, Nicholas, Peretsman, Miller
and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman also moved to dismiss the
complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of
process.  At a hearing on May 3, 2004,
the Court stated that it would not rule on the pending motions until the
pending motions in the Delaware action described above are decided.  The Court conducted a subsequent status
conference on January 10, 2005, at which it requested that the parties report
back no later than March 15, 2005 on the status of the Delaware derivative
suit.  On March 15, 2005, the parties
informed the Court in writing that the oral argument in the Delaware case had
been postponed until May 9, 2005, and that the parties would contact the Court
with a status report after that hearing was held.  The Delaware Court dismissed three of the
four counts in the second amended complaint in the Delaware derivative
suit.  All of the counts against the
defendants Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller, Peretsman and Schulman
have now been dismissed.  The parties in
the Connecticut action advised the Connecticut Court of the Delaware Court’s
ruling by letter dated June 6, 2005.  The
Delaware Court subsequently granted plaintiff leave to file the second amended
complaint as to the one remaining count. 
Defendants sought an interlocutory appeal of the Delaware Court’s order,
and the Delaware Supreme Court accepted that appeal.  The parties in the Connecticut action advised
the Connecticut Court of those developments by letter dated November 3,
2005.  We intend to defend vigorously
against this action.  We are unable to
predict the outcome of this suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible
loss, if any.

Other
Litigation

On January 6, 1999, we received notice that a
third party patent applicant and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston,
purportedly had filed in December 1998 with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office a request to declare an interference between a patent
application filed by Woolston and our U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  We are currently awaiting information from
the Patent Office regarding whether it will initiate an interference
proceeding.


From time to time, we have been and expect to
continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of business, including claims of alleged infringement of third party
intellectual property rights by it.  Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from our
business objectives and could adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

PART II

Item 5.  Market
for the Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities

Price Range of Common Stock

Our
common stock has been quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol “PCLN”
since our initial public offering on March 29, 1999. Prior to such time, there
was no public market for our common stock. The following table sets forth, for
the periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share of the common stock
as reported on the Nasdaq National Market:

Holders

As
of February 23, 2006, there were approximately 1,135 stockholders of record of
priceline.com’s common stock, although we believe that there are a
significantly larger number of beneficial owners.

Dividend Policy

We
have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock since our
inception and do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable
future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the
expansion of our business. Under the terms of the certificate of designation
relating to our Series B Preferred Stock, we cannot issue any dividends on
shares of our common stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on
the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend periods ending on or prior to the
proposed date of payment of a dividend on our common stock.


Warrants

In
March 2003, in connection with the renewal of a marketing agreement with
Marriott International, Inc., we issued Marriott 833,333 warrants to purchase
shares of our common stock at $9.84 per share. 
The warrants, which were not transferable, were fully vested,
non-forfeitable, and would have become exercisable no earlier than three years
from the date of issuance (subject to certain limited exceptions in the event
of a reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving
priceline.com).  In connection with the
issuance of the warrants, we recorded a charge in the first quarter of 2003 of
approximately $6.6 million, or $(0.17) of earnings per share.

In December 2005, we
repurchased the warrants at their then current fair value of $12.2 million.  The repurchase price was paid in cash and
upon repurchase all of the warrants were cancelled.

Delta Air Lines holds warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of $17.81 per share (the “Delta Warrants”).  Delta may exercise the Delta Warrants only by surrendering shares of our Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.  If, however, the closing sales price of our common stock has exceeded $53.44 (subject to adjustment) for 20 consecutive trading days, the Delta Warrants will automatically be exercised.  In such event, the exercise price will be paid by surrendering shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.  The Delta Warrants are exercisable at any time prior to February 6, 2007.  Please see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Delta Warrants. Delta also holds warrants to purchase 779,166 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $28.31 per shar
e.  These warrants became exercisable in November 2004.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

Information required by Part II, Item 5, relating to Equity Compensation Plan Information will be included in our Proxy Statement relating to our 2006 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after th
e end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Under this program, we repurchased warrants for $12.2 million (see Note 16) in December 2005.

Overview

General

.  We are a leading online travel
company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including
airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages and cruises.  We offer our customers a unique choice: the
ability to purchase travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or
the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your
Own Price

®

service, which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at
discounted prices.  At present, we derive
substantially all of our revenues from the following sources:

•

Transaction revenues from
our

airline
ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages
service;

•

Commissions earned from the
sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel
services;

•

Customer processing fees
charged in connection with the sale of both

and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars service;

•

Worldspan, L.P. reservation
booking fees related to both our

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car service, and price-disclosed airline
tickets and rental car service;

•

Transaction revenue from our
price-disclosed hotel room service; and

•

Other revenues derived
primarily from selling advertising on our websites.

Trends

.  The online sale of travel
services has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the Internet since the
late 1990s.  While the online market for
travel services continues to experience significant annualized growth, we
believe that the domestic market share of third-party distributors, like
priceline.com, has declined over the recent past and that the growth of the
domestic online market for travel services has slowed.  We believe the decline in market share is
attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct
customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses
and establish more direct control over their pricing.  In addition, over the course of 2005,
airlines and hotel chains have generally experienced year-over-year increases
in load factors (a common metric that measures airplane customer usage) and
occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage),
respectively, which leaves them with less excess inventory to provide third
party intermediaries like priceline.com. 
Notwithstanding these trends, we continue to believe that the market for
online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for
growth, in particular, in certain international markets.

Because
we believe that an opportunity for growth exists in certain international
markets, and since prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, substantially all of
our revenue was generated in the U.S., we have taken steps to expand the
markets we serve.  In September 2004, we
acquired Active Hotels Ltd., a U.K. based online hotel service.  Active Hotels gives us a strong presence in
the U.K.’s online hotel


market. 
Furthermore, in July 2005, we acquired Amsterdam-based Bookings B.V.,
one of Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation services, with offices primarily
in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Loule, Paris, Rome and Pisa.  All of our European operations, including
Active Hotels and Bookings, are majority-owned by us.  A minority interest in our European business
is held by our managers responsible for that business.  We work with a range of chain-owned and
independently owned hotels across Europe and in major cities around the world
to provide hotel reservations on various websites in multiple languages.

Our
European operations are an important contributor to our business and we expect
that over the course of 2006, they will represent a growing percentage of our
total gross bookings and net income.  In
addition to the ongoing businesses of our European operations, which consist
primarily of offering European hotel rooms to European customers, over the
course of 2006, we intend to offer European customers access to our U.S. based
travel services and to enhance the European travel services that we currently
offer U.S. customers.

As
our European operations become more meaningful contributors to our results, we
have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating
expenses and other financial metrics. 
For example, because our European operations utilize online affiliate
marketing and Internet search engines, principally through the purchase of
travel-related keywords, as principal means of generating traffic to their
websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our
acquisition of those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout
2006.  In addition, and as discussed in
more detail below, since the acquisitions of Active Hotels and Bookings, we
have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuation on our results change as a result
of different revenue recognition policies that apply to our European hotel
service (as well as our domestic retail hotel service) and the increased
importance European hotel bookings to our results of operations.

Our
overall financial prospects and, in particular, the financial prospects of our
domestic business, have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon
the sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our
business has been directly related to the health of the airline industry.  Most domestic airlines, and many of our major
suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, significant
losses.  These losses have been
compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and, more recently, by high
fuel prices, which we believe increase the possibility of the additional
bankruptcy and/or the liquidation of one or more of the major domestic
airlines.  As a result of these and other
factors, many of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline
tickets to maintain market share, simplified fare structures by removing
restrictions associated with certain airline tickets and, as discussed in more
detail in “

Other

” below, put
pressure on third-party intermediaries like us to reduce airline distribution
costs.  These actions have had, and
continue to have, a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and, in
particular, our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service, which
historically represented a significant portion of our total airline ticket
revenues.

As a result of the continued
decline in sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets over the last
several years, we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify
our revenue among “non-opaque” services, such as allowing our customers to
purchase price-disclosed retail airline, hotel and rental car travel services,
which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal.

We intend to continue to
execute on our strategy of diversifying our service offerings and markets,
through both continued internal development of services and, if appropriate,
acquisitions.  As a result of the
diversification described above, the growth rates for our “agency” businesses,
which are generally comprised of our price-disclosed retail services, have,
over the recent past, significantly exceeded the growth rates for our “merchant”
businesses, which are comprised primarily of our slower-growing

Name Your Own Price

®

services.


Other

.  A number of travel suppliers,
particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to
reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on
what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as global
distribution systems (GDSs).  A number of
travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require
rebates of all or part of the fees received from the GDS.  We have agreed to rebate certain GDS costs to
certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such as those
relating to inventory pricing and availability, and expect to continue to do so
in the future.  Additionally, travel
suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to
develop technology to bypass the GDS, such as enabling direct connections to
the travel suppliers or using other alternatives to traditional GDSs.  Development of such technology would require
the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur
additional operating expenses and delay other projects.  We have been and believe that we will
continue to be under significant pressure from travel suppliers, including most
of the major domestic airlines and many of our significant hotel suppliers, to
rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P.
and to significantly reduce or eliminate their distribution costs.

We believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to
maintain profitability, primarily from our leisure travel business, to continue
to promote the priceline.com brand and, over time, to offer other travel
services and further expand into international markets. Factors beyond our
control, such as the outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease; natural disasters
such as hurricanes, tsunamis or earthquakes; terrorist attacks, hostilities in
the Middle East or elsewhere; or the liquidation of major domestic airlines now
in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from
our system of a major airline (or the consolidation of our major airline
suppliers) or hotel supplier, could adversely affect our business and results
of operations and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of
the initiatives described above.  We intend
to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel
within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results.  We also intend to broaden the scope of our
business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time
in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions.  Our goal is to improve volume and sustain
gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment
described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult,
and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue
growth and profitability.

Seasonality

Prior to introducing a retail travel option to our customers,
substantially all of our business was conducted under the

Name Your
Own Price

®

system and accordingly, because those services
are non-refundable in nature, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking
was generated.  We recognize revenue
generated from our retail hotel service, however, including our European
operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a result, we have seen and expect to
continue to see, that a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated
earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer
vacations, will not be recognized until future quarters. From a cost
perspective, however, we expense all of our advertising activities as they are
incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which bookings are
generated.  Therefore, as our retail
hotel business continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become
increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are
based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting
policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of
operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as
a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently
uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to
determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of
certain estimates. On an on-


going
basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items
described below. Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical
experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel
industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. 
A summary of our significant accounting policies that involve
significant estimates and judgments of management, including the following:

•

Merchant
Revenues and Merchant Cost of Revenues

Name Your Own Price

®

Services

:  Merchant revenues and related cost of
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and
are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our
customers, remitting payments to our suppliers and establishing the price of
the services we offer. We recognize such revenue and costs if and when we
accept and fulfill the customer’s non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and
cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost, respectively, of
the travel services and are reported on a gross basis.

Pursuant to the terms of our hotel service, our hotel
suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the service
during a specified period of time.  In
the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the specified
time period, we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts.

revenues for our

merchant price-disclosed

hotel service are derived
from transactions where customers use our service to purchase hotel rooms from
hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements.  Charges are billed to customers at the time of
booking and are included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer
completes his or her stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon
cancellation prior to stay, subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases.
Merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at
the conclusion of the customer’s stay at the hotel. We record the difference
between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue.

•

Agency
Revenues and Cost of Revenues

.

Agency revenues are derived from travel related
transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of
the products sold are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include
travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan, L.P. reservation
booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any
associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized at the conclusion of
the customer’s travel.  We provide an
allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and the age of the
commission receivable.

•

Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance

.  As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of
deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax
assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be
realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future
realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative
earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable
income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
and other relevant factors. Management concluded in the third quarter 2005,
based upon its assessment of positive and negative evidence, that it is more
likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be
realized.  Accordingly, we recorded a
non-cash tax benefit in the third quarter 2005 of $170.5 million, resulting
from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax
assets.  We believe that it is more
likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized
and,


accordingly, a valuation
allowance against those assets remains. 
The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if facts
and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the realization of its
deferred tax assets.

•

Accounting for State and Local “Hotel Occupancy”
Taxes

. As discussed in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements,
several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits against us alleging, among other
things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between
the price paid by a customer for our service and the cost of the underlying
room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential.
Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to
sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect
such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. To the extent that
any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility
applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might
have additional tax exposures.  We will continue to assess the risks of
the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures, and to the extent
appropriate, we will reserve for those estimated liabilities.

•

Airline
Debit Memos.

Our airline suppliers periodically send us debit
memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost
of airline tickets we sold on their behalf. 
We process the debit memos received and, when appropriate, make payments
to the airlines.  Based on our historical
experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines, we establish
reserves for estimated losses resulting from these claims.

•

Allowance
for Credit Card Charge-backs.

Because we act
as merchant of record in the majority of our transactions, we may be held
liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other
payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for
accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not
act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance
for the resulting credit card charge-backs.

•

Refunds.

In limited
circumstances, we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to
customers to satisfy disputes and complaints. Based on our historical
experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers, we establish
reserves for estimated losses resulting from these accommodations.

•

Valuation
of Goodwill

.  We have
recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired including Bookings,
Active Hotels, Travelweb and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill is

reviewed at
least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation techniques.  In the event that future circumstances
indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine
that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment
charge to be recorded.


•

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles.

We evaluate whether events
or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of
long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The
significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review
include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use
of an asset; under performance relative to historical or expected future
operating results; and negative industry or economic trends.  In evaluating an asset for possible
impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to
measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is
not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted
cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.

•

Equity
Investments.

W

e have, among
other investments, a 49% equity interest in pricelinemortgage.com and,
accordingly, recognize our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating
results, not to exceed an amount that we believe represents the investment’s
estimated fair value.  The carrying value
of the investment at December 31, 2005 was $10.7 million.

We periodically test this investment for impairment
using a number of assumptions and estimates. 
In the event that future circumstances indicate a need to change these
assumptions or estimates, we could determine that some part or all of the
carrying value of pricelinemortgage.com is impaired requiring an impairment
charge to be recorded.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2005 compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2004

Operating Metrics

Our
financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the
selling activity generated by our travel services.  Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our
customers.  Gross Bookings capture

the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and
fees of all travel services
purchased by our customers.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days
sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows:

Airline
tickets sold decreased by 0.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005,
over the same period in 2004.  The
decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily
attributable to a significant percentage decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, largely
offset by an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets.

Hotel
room nights sold increased by 51.3% for the twelve months ended December 31,
2005, over the same period in 2004.  The
increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to
the inclusion of hotel room nights sold through our European operations, which
are substantially comprised of Active Hotels and Bookings, which were acquired
in the third quarters of 2004 and 2005, respectively, and our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service, which was integrated after our acquisition of
Travelweb during


the second quarter 2004.  This increase was partially offset by a
decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights, in part
due to the increased focus on our website of our merchant price-disclosed hotel
service.

Rental
car days sold increased by 13.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005,
over the same period in 2004 due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car
service, increases in sales of our retail rental car service, which was
launched in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the launch of new features,
including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals.

Gross
bookings increased by 32.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005,
compared to the same period in 2004.  The
increase was driven primarily by an increase of 81.6% in “agency” bookings for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily attributable to
(1) the inclusion of approximately $468 million of gross bookings from our
European operations; (2) the increased sale of retail airline tickets; (3) the
inclusion of agency gross bookings relating to our retail hotel service
launched in March 2005; and (4) the increased sale of retail rental cars.  Merchant gross bookings increased by 1.1% for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. 
The increase was primarily due to an increase in merchant
price-disclosed hotel bookings, mostly offset by a decrease in the sale of
opaque airline tickets.

Revenues

We
classify our revenue into three categories:

•

Merchant
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and
are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our
customers, remitting payments to our suppliers and establishing the price of
the services we offer.  Merchant revenues
include (1) transaction revenues representing the selling price of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and price-disclosed vacation packages; (2)
transaction revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the
amount charged by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through
our merchant price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees
charged in connection with the sale of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental
cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees, including
Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to certain of the
aforementioned transactions.

•

Agency
revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the
merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third
parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees
and Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to certain of the
aforementioned transactions and are reported at the net amounts received,
without any associated cost of revenue.

•

Other revenues are derived primarily from
advertising on our websites.

We
continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket business from a
business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant (“opaque”)

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services to a business that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel
services.  Because merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services are reported
on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are primarily recorded on a “net”
basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of
the sale of merchant and retail travel services and, consequently, gross profit
has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our
business.  Additionally, our European
operations contributed approximately $70 million to our revenues for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2005.  Revenues
generated by our European operations are primarily recorded on a “net” basis.


Merchant Revenues

Merchant
revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 1.6%,
compared to the same period in 2004 due to a substantial percentage decrease in
the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, which was partially offset by an increase in merchant
price-disclosed hotel bookings.  We
believe that the decrease in the number of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets sold continued to be due
primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail
tickets on our website.  In particular,
we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be
willing to make the trade­offs associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline service in exchange
for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel services at the
lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers, without having to make any
trade-offs.

Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 increased 157%, compared
to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of (1) the inclusion of
approximately $67 million of agency revenue for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005, from our European operations; and (2) increased sales of
retail airline tickets, hotels and rental cars, partially offset by a decrease
in Worldspan, L.P. GDS fees.  Results
from our European operations consist of a full year of operations from Active
Hotels, which was acquired in September 2004, and approximately six months of
operations from Bookings, which was acquired in July 2005.

Other Revenues

Other
revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 consisted primarily
of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to
pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services.  Other revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005 increased compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a
result of higher online advertising revenue.


Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, cost of revenues decreased by 3.0%,
compared to the same period in 2004, due primarily to a shift in the mix of
revenue from merchant services toward agency services that have higher gross
margins.  Merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues
are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a
smaller percentage of transactions as compared to retail transactions which are
recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Cost of Merchant Revenues

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, cost of merchant revenues consisted
primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable
taxes, (2) the cost of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the
federal air transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges
imposed in connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque
rental cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash
acquisition-related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of
Travelweb.  Cost of merchant revenues for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 2.9%, compared to the
same period in 2004, due primarily to a decrease in overall merchant revenues.  Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are
recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to
suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant
price-disclosed hotel revenues.

Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less
amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency
revenues.  For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of
non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses associated with our recent
acquisitions.


Cost of Other Revenues

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no costs of
other revenues.

Gross Profit

Total
gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 increased by 35.2%
compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of increased revenue
from (1) the inclusion of results from our European operations which consist of
a full year of operations from Active Hotels which was acquired in September
2004, and approximately six months of operations from Bookings, which was
acquired in July 2005; and (2) increased sales of retail travel services.  Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as
a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve month period ended
December 31, 2005, compared to the same period in 2004, because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues
are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller
percentage of transactions compared to agency and merchant price-disclosed
transactions which are primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of
revenues.  Because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions are reported “gross”
and retail transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe
that gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating
growth in our business.

Merchant Gross Profit

Merchant
gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, merchant gross profit increased
from the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of gross profit
relating to our merchant price-disclosed hotel service and growth in our

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car
service, partially offset by a substantial decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets.  Merchant gross margin increased
primarily because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues
are recorded “gross” with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a
smaller percentage of transactions in the twelve months ended December 31,
2005, when compared to merchant price-disclosed hotel transactions, which are
recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues.


Agency Gross Profit

Agency
gross profit consists of agency revenues, which are recorded net of agency
costs, if any.  For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2005, agency gross profit increased over the same period in
2004, primarily due to the inclusion of the results of our European operations,
and an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, hotels and rental cars,
partially offset by a decrease in Worldspan, L.P. GDS fees.

Other Gross Profit

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, other gross profit increased from
the same period in 2004 primarily as a result of higher online advertising
revenues.

Operating Expenses

Advertising

Offline
advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) the expenses associated with
television and radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, the cost for creative
talent and production costs for television and radio commercials. For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2005, offline advertising expenses were lower
than in the same period in 2004, as we shifted more of our advertising budget
to online.  Online advertising expenses
primarily consist of the costs of (1) search engine keyword purchases; (2)
affiliate programs; (3) banner and pop-up advertisements; and (4) e-mail
advertisements.  For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2005, online advertising expenses increased over the same
period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising
expenses related to our European operations and our merchant price-disclosed
hotel service, each of which relies primarily on online advertising to drive
its business.

Sales and Marketing


Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card
processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate our call centers; and (3) provisions
for credit card charge-backs.  For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2005, sales and marketing expenses, which are
substantially variable in nature, increased over the same period in 2004, due
to increased gross booking volumes and the inclusion of sales and marketing
expenses associated with our European operations.

Personnel

Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including
salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock based
compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, personnel expenses
increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to the inclusion of
personnel expenses associated with our European operations and an increase in
stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock grants to employees
and directors.  Stock based compensation expense
was approximately $4.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005,
and approximately $0.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.

General and Administrative

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside
professionals; (2) business insurance; (3) occupancy expenses; and (4)
litigation related expenses. General and administrative expenses increased
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 over the same period during
2004, due to the inclusion of our European operations and additional fees for
outside professionals and expenses related to pending litigation.

Information
Technology


Information technology expenses consist primarily of: (1) system maintenance
and software license fees; (2) data communications and other expenses
associated with operating our Internet sites; and (3) payments to outside
contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, information
technology expenses increased from the same period in 2004 primarily due to the
inclusion of information technology expenses associated with our European
operations.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization expenses consist of: 
(1) amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives; (2)
amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (3) depreciation
of computer equipment; and (4) depreciation of leasehold improvements, office
equipment and furniture and fixtures. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, depreciation and
amortization expense increased from the same period in 2004, primarily as a
result of the inclusion of non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses
associated with our European operations.

Restructuring Charge (Reversal)

In
2005, we recorded a net restructuring charge of $1.7 million, comprised of a
$2.0 million charge based upon a re-evaluation of the estimated costs related
to leased property originally vacated in 2000, partly offset by a $0.3 million
reversal based upon a re-evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain
European restructuring activities.

Interest


For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, interest income on cash and
marketable securities increased over the same period in 2004, primarily due to
higher prevailing interest rates. 
Interest expense increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005
over the same period in 2004 because our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes issued
in June 2004 were outstanding for the entire twelve month period in 2005.

Taxes

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of
approximately $156 million.  This
principally resulted from a non-cash tax benefit recorded in the third quarter
of 2005 of $171 million, relating to the reversal of a portion of our valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets. The non-cash tax benefit was recorded
pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, that require a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset
valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize
all or some portion of its deferred tax assets. Due to our significant net
operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S.
federal taxable income for the foreseeable future.  As a result of the reversal, we recorded a
mostly non-cash $12.5 million provision for U.S. income tax expense in our
Consolidated Financial Statements in 2005, and will continue to record a non-cash
provision for U.S. income tax expense in future periods.  This non-cash U.S. income tax provision will
materially negatively impact net income and earnings per share in subsequent
periods as compared to prior periods.  We
expect to make cash tax payments for U.S. alternative minimum taxes and for
certain international taxes.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and
Minority Interests

Equity in income of
investees and minority interests for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, represented (1) our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net
results, (2) minority interests associated with the 8.5% ownership of
priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business
and (3) until May 2004, our pro rata share of Travelweb’s net results.  The increase in equity in income of investees
and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to increases in
equity in income of investees related to (1) our equity in the increase in
pricelinemortgage.com’s net income in both periods and (2) the exclusion of our
equity in the net loss of Travelweb subsequent to our acquisition of Travelweb
in May 2004.  This increase was partially
offset by the inclusion of the aforementioned minority interests in
priceline.com International.


Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2004 compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2003

Operating Metrics

Our
financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the
selling activity generated by our travel services.  Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our
customers.  Gross Bookings capture

the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and
fees of all travel services
purchased by our customers.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days
sold were as follows:

Airline
tickets sold increased by 55.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004,
as compared to the same period in 2003. 
The increase was driven entirely by the introduction of retail choice to
our airline service.  The growth in each
period was partially offset by large annualized percentage decreases in sales
of opaque airline tickets sold in each period. 
See “

Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Trends

”
above.

Hotel
room nights sold increased by 36.8% for the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, as compared to the same period in 2003. 
The increase was driven by (1) the continued success of our opaque hotel

service

, which benefited
from continued direct advertising support and (2) the inclusion of hotel room
nights sold by Travelweb and Active Hotels during the respective periods in
2004, subsequent to their acquisitions.

Rental
car days sold increased by 37.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004,
as compared to the same period in 2003, due to increases in sales of our opaque
rental car

service

through priceline.com and our retail rental car

service

through
priceline.com, Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com.

Gross
Bookings increased by

51.9%
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period
in 2003.  The increase was driven primarily by a 336.4%
increase in agency bookings in 2004 as a result of (1) the introduction of
retail choice to our airline service and (2) the inclusion of approximately $54
million of bookings from Active Hotels in our 2004 results.  Gross bookings also increased as a result of
an 8.1% increase in merchant bookings in 2004, as a result of (1) the continued
success of our opaque hotel, rental car and vacation package services which offset significant annualized
declines in bookings of our opaque airline ticket service; and (2) the
inclusion of approximately $75 million of bookings from Travelweb in our 2004
results.


Revenues

We continue to experience a shift in our airline ticket business mix
from a historically merchant opaque model to include a growing number of
retail, price-disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are reported gross
and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, airline ticket revenue
increases and decreases are impacted by changes in merchant and retail sales
mix and gross profit has become an important measure of evaluating growth in
our business.  Additionally, our
acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels during the second and third
quarters, respectively, contributed approximately $23.6 million to our revenues
in 2004.

Merchant Revenues

The
$20.5 million increase in merchant revenue for the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004 compared
to the same period in 2003 was primarily attributable to continued growth in

Name Your Own Price

®

hotels and
our vacation package

service

, and the inclusion of
approximately $15.5 million of revenues from Travelweb in 2004, subsequent to
our acquisition of Travelweb, partially offset by (1) a substantial decrease in
the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, and (2) decreased travel caused by the adverse weather in the
Southeastern U.S. during the third quarter of 2004.  We believe that the decrease in the number of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our
overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004 –
continued to be due primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the
availability of retail tickets on our website. 
In particular, we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who
might normally be willing to make the trade-offs associated with our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline

service

in exchange
for


savings
off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel

service

s at the lower
retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make any
trade-offs.

Agency Revenues

Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased
from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of (1) our increased focus
on the retail airline ticket business, driven primarily by new advertising
campaigns focused on our retail airline ticket and vacation packages service,
(2) increased rental car business, including the impact of our acquisitions of
Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com, and the resulting increase in travel
commissions, GDS and processing fees earned, and (3) the inclusion of
approximately $8 million of agency revenue from Active Hotels subsequent to our
acquisition in September of 2004.

Other Revenues

Other
revenues during the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004 and 2003
consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring
customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services.

Other
revenues for the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004
decreased compared to the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower
financial services fees and reduced online advertising revenue.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, cost of revenues decreased by approximately
$1.5 million, over the same period in 2003, due primarily to a shift in the mix
of revenue generated by services that produce higher gross margins.  Specifically, our opaque hotel service, which
produces the highest gross margins of our four principal opaque offerings,
represented a higher percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to
2003.  Conversely, our opaque airline
service, which produces lower gross margins, declined significantly on a
year-over-year basis, and therefore represented a substantially lower
percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003.  Cost of revenues grew at a slower rate than
revenues because opaque transactions, whose revenues


are
recorded gross with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller
percentage of transactions in both periods as compared to retail transactions
(principally Travelweb) that are recorded net with no corresponding cost of
revenues.

Cost of Merchant Revenues

For
the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004 and 2003, cost of
merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of opaque hotel rooms
from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax, (2) the cost of opaque airline
tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation tax, segment
fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the sale of
airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars from our suppliers, net of
applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash acquisition related amortization expenses
associated with the acquisition of Travelweb. 
Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004,
decreased approximately 0.4%

compared to the same period in 2003

, due primarily
to the shift in the mix of revenue generated by

service

s that generate
different levels of gross margins, as discussed above.

Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less
amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency
revenues.  For the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004, cost of
agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash acquisition related
amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels.

Cost of Other Revenues

For
the twelve months ended

December 31

, 2004 and 2003, there were
no costs of other revenues.

Gross Profit

Total gross profit increased for the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, by approximately $52.2 million
primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our opaque hotel and
vacation package services; (2) increased sales of retail services; and (3) the
inclusion of results from Travelweb and Active Hotels.  Total gross margin (gross profit expressed as
a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004, compared to the same period in 2003, because opaque
transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of
revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both periods as
compared to retail transactions which are recorded net with no corresponding
cost of revenues.  Because merchant
transactions are reported gross and retail transactions (primarily Travelweb)
are recorded on a net basis, we believe that gross profit has become an
increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business.


Merchant Gross Profit

Merchant
gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of merchant revenues.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, merchant gross profit increased
from the same period in 2003, primarily due to (1) increased revenue from

Name Your Own Price

®

hotels and
our vacation package

service

; (2) the inclusion of $12.3
million of gross profit from Travelweb; and (3)

an increase in the
percentage of our revenues represented by our opaque hotel, vacation packages
and rental car services, which collectively have a higher gross margin than our
opaque airline ticket service.

Merchant gross margin also increased

because opaque
transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of
revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in 2004, when
compared to retail transactions (primarily Travelweb), which are recorded net
with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Agency Gross Profit

Agency
gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net of agency
costs, if any.  For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2004, agency gross profit increased over the same period in
2003 due to an increase in the sale of disclosed price airline tickets, rental
cars and related processing, GDS fees and travel commissions, and the inclusion
of the results of Active Hotels subsequent to our acquisition.

Other Gross Profit

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, other gross profit decreased from
the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower pricelinemortgage.com
referral fees and reduced online advertising revenues.


Operating Expenses

Advertising

Offline
advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and radio
advertising; and (2) agency fees, creative talent and production costs for
television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, offline advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2003
primarily due to an increase in the frequency of television advertising
associated with our new retail choice airline ticket

service

, continued
advertising for our hotel

service

, creative talent and
production costs for our new advertising campaign.

Online advertising expenses
consist primarily of banners, pop-ups, keyword searches, affiliate programs and
e-mail advertisements.  For the

twelve months
ended December 31, 2004

, online advertising expenses increased over 2003
primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising expenses of Travelweb
and Active Hotels, which each rely primarily on online advertising to drive
their respective businesses.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card
processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate our call centers; (3) provisions for
credit card charge-backs; and (4) warrant costs for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003.  The warrant charge
related to the issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to
Marriott International, Inc. during the first quarter of 2003.  There was no similar charge during 2004.

For the

twelve months
ended December 31

, 2004, sales and marketing expenses decreased over
the same period in 2003 due to the one-time nature of the charge associated
with the issuance of the warrant in 2003. 
Excluding the effect of the warrant charge of $6.6 million in 2003,
sales and marketing expense for the twelve months

ended December 31

, 2004, were
almost entirely variable in nature and therefore increased over the same period
in 2003, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as the
inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with Travelweb and Active
Hotels.


Personnel

Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including
salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health benefits and stock based
compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, personnel expenses
increased over the same period in 2003 primarily due to additional salary
expense resulting from the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels, as well
as increases in performance-based employee bonuses.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of: (1) fees for outside professionals; (2) business insurance; and (3)
occupancy expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the
twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the same period in 2003 due to
additional fees for outside professionals, including those related to
Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance and litigation activities.  General and administrative expenses also
increased as a result of the inclusion of Travelweb and Active Hotels.

Information
Technology

Information technology expenses consist
primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data
communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites;
and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December
31, 2004, information technology expenses increased from the same period in
2003 primarily due to integration and related operating expenses resulting from
the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels.


Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation
and amortization expenses consist of: 
(1) amortization of internally developed and purchased software, (2)
depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of leasehold improvements,
office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization of intangible
assets with determinable lives primarily associated with the acquisitions of
Travelweb and Active Hotels.  For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and amortization expense
increased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of an increase in
depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions of
Travelweb and Active Hotels, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciable
base of certain long-lived assets.

Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges

In
the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$564,000.  This restructuring charge
resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our estimated real estate costs
related to leased property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000
restructurings.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$4.7 million.  This restructuring charge
resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel businesses and a reduction in
headcount.  The repositioning was
designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel
business.  The charge relates primarily
to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments.

We estimate, based on current information available, the remaining net
cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be
paid in 2005.  These restructuring
accruals are recorded in “Accrued expenses” and “Other long-term liabilities”
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  See
Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest

For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004, net interest income on cash and marketable securities
increased over the same period in 2003, primarily due to higher overall cash
and investment balances.  Interest income
was partially offset by interest expense, including coupon interest and
amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the issuance of
our $125 million


aggregate principal amount 1% Convertible Senior Notes issued in August
2003, and our $100 million aggregate principal amount 2.25% Convertible Senior
Notes issued in June 2004.

Equity in Income (Loss) of Investees and
Minority Interests

Equity in loss
of investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, represented
our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb, prior to our acquisition of a
majority of its equity in May and December 2004, and our pro rata share of
pricelinemortgage.com’s net income.  The
decrease in equity in income of investees was primarily due to (1) increases in
interest rates which caused a slowdown in the refinancing activity by
pricelinemortgage.com’s customers that pricelinemortgage.com benefited from throughout
2003, and (2) the settlement by pricelinemortgage.com, in the fourth quarter of
2004, of a patent infringement lawsuit and associated legal fees that
negatively impact their 2004 operating results.

Taxes

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an income tax benefit of
$193,000.  The benefit relates to a net
foreign tax benefit related to the operations of Active Hotels in the U.K.,
partially offset by federal alternative minimum taxes related to income earned
in the United States.  See Note 18 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As
of December 31, 2005, we had $175.4 million in cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash. Approximately $22.3 million is
restricted cash on deposit collateralizing letters of credit issued in favor of
certain suppliers and landlords. Also included in restricted cash are amounts
held by our credit card processor. We generally invest excess cash to make such
funds readily available for operating purposes. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of
highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments.

All
of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front
from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent
date.  We therefore tend to experience
significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our
cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter.  This can cause volatility in working capital
levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would
indicate.

Net
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
$62.6 million, resulting from net income of $192.7 million, less non-cash items
of $124.2 million, and $5.9 million of changes in working capital.  The changes in working capital for the year
ended December 31, 2005, were primarily related to an $8.3 million increase in
accounts receivable offset by a $1.7 million increase in accounts payable, accrued
expenses and other liabilities.  The
increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues and
timing of collections.  Non-cash items
were primarily associated with the deferred income tax benefit, depreciation
and amortization of intangible assets, primarily those acquired in our
acquisitions of Travelweb, Active Hotels and Bookings.  The deferred income tax benefit resulted
primarily from the $171 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our deferred
tax valuation allowance.  Net cash
provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004,


was
$42.0 million, resulting from net income of $31.5 million, non-cash items not
affecting December 31, 2004 cash flows of $17.7 million, partially offset by
$7.2 million of changes in working capital. 
The changes in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
primarily related to a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.4
million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  The increase in accounts receivable was
primarily due to an increase in revenues attributable to increased hotel,
vacation package and rental car transactions. The decrease in accounts payable
was related to seasonal decreases in deferred merchant bookings and accounts
payable balances.  Non-cash items were
primarily associated with the depreciation and amortization of property and
equipment and intangible assets, primarily those acquired in our acquisitions
of Travelweb and Active Hotels.

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately $94.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005, and approximately $143.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.  During the year ended
December 31, 2005, we invested $135.2 million, net of cash acquired, in
acquisitions, the substantial majority of which related to Bookings.  During the year ended December 31, 2004, we
invested $164.7 million, net of cash acquired, the substantial majority of
which related to the acquisition of Active Hotels.  Net redemptions of short-term investments of
$50.5 million and $28.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, partially
offset the use of funds for financing activities.  In both years, net cash used in investing
activities was also affected by purchases of property and equipment.  During the year ended December 31, 2005, this
amount was higher than previous periods due to increased spending on
capitalized development activities, especially those related to the launch of
our retail hotel service, purchases of computer hardware and the inclusion of
capital spending by our newly acquired subsidiaries.

Net cash provided by
financing activities was approximately $13.2 and $107.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December
31, 2005, was primarily the proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in
subsidiary of $18.7 million and the exercise of employee stock options of $6.7
million, partially offset by $12.2 million used to repurchase warrants held by
Marriott International, Inc.  A majority
of the proceeds for the year ended December 31, 2004 was provided by the
issuance of $100 million of convertible senior notes and proceeds from the
exercise of employee stock options of $6.8 million.

The following table
represents the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments as of
December 31, 2005 (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements):

(1)

Assumes redemption of $125
million aggregate principal amount of 1% Senior Convertible Notes in August
2008 and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Senior Convertible
Notes in January 2010.  Assumes no
conversion of the Notes into common stock. 
The holders of the 1% and 2.25% notes may require us to repurchase the
notes on August 1, 2008, and January 15, 2010, respectively.  Also includes interest payable on the Notes.

(2)

Assumes no additional
exercise of warrants and/or redemption of Redeemable Preferred stock during
February 2007.


(3)

Assumes holders of minority
interests put their shares to us at the earliest possible date at the current
carrying value (see Note 19 for terms of put provisions).

Priceline.com
leases office space in buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut; Cambridge England
(Active Hotels); and Amsterdam, Netherlands (Bookings).  These leases are accounted for as operating
leases.  The operating lease obligations
represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 19 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1% Notes
and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels in 2004,
and in the acquisition of Bookings in 2005. 
The remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes,
strategic uses and working capital requirements.

Excluded
from the table above are other long-term liabilities and letters of credit of
approximately $10.7 million that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and
landlords. The letters of credit expire between March 2006 and March 2007 and
are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of
credit.  Also excluded are employment
agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for cash
severance payments of approximately $10.3 million (which does not include the
estimated value of such benefits as continuation of medical or dental benefits
or the impact of excise tax gross-up).

Our
Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus
an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is
subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007.  In the event that we consummate certain
business combination transactions, our Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed
at our option or at the option of the holder at the liquidation preference per
outstanding share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and dividends that would
have accrued through February 6, 2007. 
There were 13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at
December 31, 2005.  See Note 15 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the rights and
preferences of our Series B Preferred Stock.

We
believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient
to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations
through at least the next twelve months. There are no assurances that we will
generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that future
borrowings or equity contributions will be available in amounts sufficient to
make anticipated capital expenditures, repay and debt or preferred stock or
finance our business strategies.

New Accounting Pronouncements

As more fully discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements, we were required to adopt SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006.  SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on
our Consolidated Statement of Operations as we will be required to expense the
fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the pro forma impact
on our consolidated operations within our footnotes.  Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of
unvested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2005 is estimated to
increase personnel expense by approximately $6.0 million in 2006, $2.5 million
in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008.

Item
7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosure About Market Risk

We
manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through
internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed appropriate,
through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use an interest rate swap
agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts to manage foreign
currency risk.

The
objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow
and fair value exposures resulting from possible future adverse fluctuations in
rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated
near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
This evaluation includes the review of leading market indicators, discussions
with financial analysts and investment bankers regarding current and future
economic conditions and the review of market projections as to expected future
rates. We utilize this information to determine our own investment strategies
as well as to determine if the use of derivative financial instruments is
appropriate to


mitigate any potential future market
exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in derivative
instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for
which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments
for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.

We did not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures
during the year ended December 31, 2005.  Based upon economic conditions
and leading market indicators at December 31, 2005, we do not foresee a
significant adverse change in interest rates in the near future.

As of December 31, 2005, the carrying value of our debt is approximately
$223.6 million.  We estimate that the
fair market value of such debt was approximately $197 million as of December
31, 2005.

As of December 31, 2005, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45
million notional value of our fixed rate debt.  The fair value cost to
terminate this swap as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $1.5
million.  A 10% adverse fluctuation in
the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2005, would increase the cost to
terminate the interest rate swap by approximately $460,000.  Any increase or decrease in the fair value of
the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be
substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value
of the hedged underlying asset, liability, or cash flow.

As a result of our acquisitions of our European operations, we are
conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United
States but report our results in U.S. dollars.  As a result, we face exposure to adverse
movements in currency exchange rates. 
The results of operations of our European operations are exposed to
foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our European
operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon
consolidation.  If the U.S. dollar
weakens against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net
revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss.  Similarly, our net assets, net revenues,
operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the
U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as
exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations.  Our European
operations are subject to risks typical of international business, including,
but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political
climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and
foreign exchange rate volatility.

In
2005, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact
of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated operating
results.  As of December 31, 2005, there
were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding.  We may enter into additional forward
contracts or other economic hedges in the future.

Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains
and losses due to interest rate volatility. 
To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates
affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by
such changes.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based
on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over
financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2005.  We excluded from our assessment the internal
controls over financial reporting at Bookings B.V., which was acquired on July
14, 2005 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues
constituting approximately 3% and 3%, respectively, of the related Consolidated
Financial Statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. 
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

Our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Controls.

No change in our internal control over financial reporting
(as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the
fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005 that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

In
July 2005, we acquired Bookings, and as a result of this acquisition, we have
undertaken a review of Bookings’ internal controls and intend to make changes,
if necessary, that we believe to be appropriate to those internal controls as
we integrate the business with ours.  As
we further integrate Bookings’ business, we will continue to review their
internal controls and may take further steps to ensure that their internal
controls are effective and integrated appropriately.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

priceline.com, Incorporated

Norwalk, CT

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of
priceline.com, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, changes
in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005.  We also have
audited management’s assessment, included in

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

set forth in
Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

, management
excluded from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at
Bookings B.V. which was acquired on July 14, 2005 and whose financial
statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting approximately 3% and
3%, respectively, of the related Consolidated Financial Statement amounts as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2005. 
Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over
financial reporting at Bookings B.V.  The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements, an opinion on management’s
assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audit of
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error


or fraud may not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  Also in our opinion,
management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Priceline.com
Incorporated (“priceline.com,” or the “Company”) is a leading online travel
company that offers its customers a broad range of travel services, including
the opportunity to purchase airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation
packages and cruises.  The Company’s
unique

Name Your Own Price

®

system – which allows its customers to make offers for travel services at
prices they set – enables its customers to use the Internet to save money while
enabling sellers, which include many of the major domestic airline, hotel and
rental car companies, to generate incremental revenue.  The Company also offers its customers the
ability to purchase travel services in a more traditional, price-disclosed
manner.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

- The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Travelweb LLC (“Travelweb”), and its 91.5%-owned subsidiary, priceline.com
International Ltd. (“priceline.com International”), which wholly owns
priceline.com Europe Holdings N. V. (“priceline.com Europe Holdings”), Active
Hotels Ltd. (“Active Hotels”) and Bookings B.V. (“Bookings”).  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates
in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise
significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method.

In
2003, the Company’s stockholders approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of
its outstanding common stock.  The
reverse stock split was effected on June 16, 2003, and, as a result, the
Company’s issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately
227.6 million to approximately 37.9 million shares.  The par value of the common stock was not
affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share.  Consequently, on the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet, the aggregate par value of the issued common stock was reduced
by reclassifying the par value amount of the eliminated shares of common stock
to Additional Paid-in Capital.  All per
share amounts and outstanding shares, including all common stock equivalents
(stock options), have been retroactively restated in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for all
periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split.

Use of Estimates

– The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes
thereto.  Actual results may differ from
those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

- The Company’s
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
accounts receivable-net, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred
merchant bookings, are carried at cost which approximates their fair value
because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of
the Company’s outstanding 1.0% Convertible Senior Notes was $107.2 million and
the fair value of the Company’s outstanding 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes was
$89.8 million.  The Company uses
derivative financial instruments, including interest rate hedges, to manage
market risks.  The Company entered into
an interest rate hedge agreement in relation to $45 million of the outstanding
borrowings of the 1.0% Convertible Senior Notes with a term of approximately 5
years.  See Note 13, “Convertible Debt.”

Cash and Cash Equivalents

- The Company invests excess
cash primarily in money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and
short-term commercial paper. All highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.


Short-Term Investments

– At December 31, 2005 and
2004, the Company had short-term investments of $72.7 million and $122.8
million, respectively.  The short-term
investments primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate notes and U.S.
Government Agency Securities.  In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company has
classified these short-term investments as available-for-sale.  These securities are carried at estimated
fair market value with the aggregate unrealized gains and losses related to
these investments, net of taxes, reflected as a part of accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.

The
fair value of the investments is based on the specific quoted market price of
the securities at the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates.  Investments are considered to be impaired
when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.  Once a decline in fair value is determined to
be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis
in the investment is established. The marketable securities are presented as
current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as they are
available to meet the short-term working capital needs of the Company.

Restricted Cash

- Restricted cash
collateralizes letters of credit issued in favor of certain suppliers and
landlords and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration. Also
included in restricted cash are amounts held by the Company’s credit card
processing company and the counterparty to the interest rate hedge agreement in
connection with the Company’s 1% Convertible Senior Notes.

Property and Equipment

- Property and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis,
over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill

– The Company accounts for
acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of
acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price, including
related transaction costs, over the estimated fair values of the net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill.  The
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations reflect
an acquired business starting at the date of the acquisition.

Goodwill
is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or earlier if there is indication
of impairment, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS 142 also requires the Company to compare
the fair value of the acquired business to its carrying amount on an annual
basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value
of the acquired business is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its
carrying value. Fair values for acquired businesses are determined based on
discounted cash flows, market multiples or appraised values.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets

- The Company
reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition exceeds its carrying amount. The amount of
impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the
asset over the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount
rate commensurate with the risks involved.

Software Capitalization

- Certain direct development
costs associated with internal-use software are capitalized and include
external direct costs of services and payroll costs for employees devoting time
to the software projects principally related to software coding, designing
system interfaces and installation and testing of the software. These costs are
recorded as fixed assets and are amortized over a period not to


exceed
three years beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Costs
incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and
training costs, are expensed as incurred.

Merchant Revenues and Cost of Merchant Revenues

Name Your Own Price

®

Services

:  Merchant revenues and related cost of
revenues are derived from transactions where priceline.com is the merchant of
record and, among other things, selects suppliers and determines the price to
be paid by the customer.  The Company
recognizes such revenues and costs if and when it fulfills the customer’s
non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include
the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel services and are
reported on a gross basis.  In very
limited circumstances, priceline.com makes certain customer accommodations to
satisfy disputes and complaints.  The
Company accrues for such estimated losses and classifies the resulting expense
as adjustments to merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues or the
allowance for doubtful accounts, as appropriate.

Pursuant to the
terms of the Company’s hotel service, its hotel suppliers are permitted to bill
the Company for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of
time.  In the event that the Company is
not billed by its hotel supplier within the specified time period, the Company
reduces its cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts.

Merchant Price-Disclosed Hotel Service

:  Merchant revenues for the Company’s

merchant
price-disclosed

hotel service are derived from transactions where
its customers purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at disclosed rates
which are subject to contractual arrangements. 
Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included
in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her stay.
Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay, subject
to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and accounts
payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s
stay at the hotel. The Company records the difference between the selling price
and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue.

Agency Revenues and Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where the
Company is not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold
are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions,
customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are
reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue.
Such revenues are recognized by the Company when the customer completes their
travel.

Advertising

-

Offline

- Advertising-offline expenses are
comprised primarily of costs of television, radio and newspaper advertising,
agency fees, creative talent and production cost for television and radio
commercials.  The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the
first time the advertising takes place.

Advertising

-

Online

- Advertising-online
expenses consist primarily of keyword searches, affiliate programs, banners,
pop-ups, and email advertisements and are recognized as the advertisements take
place.

Sales and Marketing

- Sales and marketing
expenses are comprised primarily of credit card processing fees, fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate the Company’s call centers,
provisions for credit card charge-backs and provisions for uncollectible
commissions, all of which are expensed as incurred.

Personnel -

Personnel expenses consist
of compensation to the Company’s personnel, including salaries, bonuses,
payroll taxes, employee health insurance and stock based compensation.  Included in accrued expenses were accrued
compensation expenses of $5.6 million and $5.8 million at December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.


Information Technology

– Information technology
expenses are comprised primarily of system maintenance and software license
fees, data communications and other expenses associated with operating the
Company’s Internet sites and payments to outside contractors. Such costs are
expensed as incurred.

Equity-Based Compensation

– Currently, the Company accounts for stock
awards and stock option grants using the intrinsic value method set forth in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related
interpretations.  Generally, no
compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants to employees if the
exercise price is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on
the date of grant.  Compensation expense
relating to other stock awards is recognized over the period during which the
employee renders service to the Company necessary to earn the award.

The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services.” All transactions, in which goods or services are the consideration
received for the issuance of equity instruments, are accounted for based on the
fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity
instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date
of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on
which the counterparty’s performance is complete or the date on which it is
probable that performance will occur.

Income Taxes

- The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary difference between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently
enacted tax rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

Segment Reporting

- The Company operates and
manages its business as a single operating segment.  For geographic related information, see Note
21 to these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Currency Translation

– The functional currency of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing
at the balance sheet date.  Income
statement amounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates.  Translation gains and losses are included as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Transaction
gains and losses are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and
were immaterial for all periods presented. 
From time to time, the Company enters into forward contracts with
counterparties pursuant to which future foreign exchange rates for expected
future earnings are fixed.  Realized and
unrealized gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts are recognized
in the period in which they occur.  As of
December 31, 2005, there were no open forward contracts.

Derivative Financial Instruments

- - The Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest
rates. The Company uses derivative instruments principally in the management of
interest rate exposure. On the date on which the Company enters into a
derivative transaction, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the
identified exposure. The Company formally documents all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the
Company specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted
transaction, or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item and
states how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to
the hedged item. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging
relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.  The Company’s derivative instruments do not
contain leverage features.


Reclassifications

–
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the current
year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

– In December
2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123(R)”), “Share-Based
Payment”, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for
share-based compensation transactions using Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair
value-based method.  SFAS 123(R) covers a
wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including stock options and
restricted share plans. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS 123(R) as of
January 1, 2006.

The Company expects to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the “modified
prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date based on (a) the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and (b) the requirements of Statement
123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS
123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date.  Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of
unvested stock options granted as of December 31, 2005 is estimated to increase
personnel expense by approximately $6.0 million in 2006, $2.5 million in 2007
and $0.5 million in 2008.

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Bookings B.V.

–

On July 14, 2005, the Company, through
priceline.com International, acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of
Bookings, an Amsterdam-based provider of online services for the booking of
European hotel reservations.  The total consideration for all of the
Bookings shares was approximately $135 million, including direct acquisition
costs and certain post-closing adjustments.  Substantially all of the
consideration for the Bookings shares was paid in available cash.

The
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination. The
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include Bookings since the
acquisition in July 2005. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed from Bookings have been recorded at the date
of acquisition, at their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the
purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was
recorded as goodwill.

Assets
acquired totaled approximately $88 million and consisted principally of
accounts receivable and intangible assets. Liabilities assumed totaled
approximately $29 million and consisted principally of accounts payable,
accrued expenses and deferred taxes. Goodwill resulting from this transaction
amounted to approximately $76 million based upon the currency exchange rate
as of the acquisition date.

The
estimated fair value and useful lives of the most significant acquired
identifiable intangible assets (based upon the currency exchange rate as of the
acquisition date) is as follows:

As
part of the transaction, six key managers of Bookings purchased securities in
the form of Series C ordinary shares of priceline.com International,
representing approximately

6% of
the share capital of priceline.com International, for total consideration of
approximately $18.7 million.  In addition, the key managers of Bookings
were granted restricted stock units that are payable in Series C ordinary
shares of priceline.com International with an aggregate fair market value of
approximately $1 million.


Certain managers and employees of Bookings
were also granted non-qualified stock options to acquire shares of the Company’s
common stock and restricted stock units payable in shares of the Company’s
common stock.

The
following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined
results of operations of the Company and Bookings as if the acquisition had
occurred as of the beginning of each period presented. The pro forma financial
information includes certain purchase accounting related entries and is not
necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that might have
occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative of expected results in the future.

4.             STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

The following table summarizes relevant information as to reported
results under the Company’s APB 25 method of accounting for stock options with
supplemental information as if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123 had been applied (in thousands, except per share amounts):


Compensation
cost measured for stock options granted to employees is amortized using a
straight-lined basis over the vesting period, which is typically three
years.  The fair value of stock options
granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted
average assumptions:

During
2005, the Company issued approximately 316,000 shares of restricted common
stock to certain of its employees and its Board of Directors. The restricted
stock has vesting periods of 12 months to 49 months.  During 2005, the Company also issued
approximately 74,000 restricted stock units to certain employees.  The restricted stock units have a vesting
period of 36 months.  The fair value of
the restricted stock and restricted stock units at the grant date totaled $8.8
million, and is being recorded as stock based compensation expense over the
vesting period.

During
2005, the Company issued approximately 11,000 shares of restricted stock and
46,000 restricted stock units of priceline.com International to certain
employees in Europe. The restricted stock


and the restricted stock units have maximum
vesting periods of 30 months. The fair value of the restricted stock and the
restricted stock units at the grant date totaled $1.8 million, and is being
recorded as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period.

In
connection with the acquisition of Active Hotels in September 2004, the Company
granted restricted stock of Active Hotels to certain employees of Active
Hotels.  The fair value of the restricted
stock at the grant date was approximately $2.1 million, and is being recorded
as stock based compensation over the three-year vesting period.  All of the restricted stock in Active Hotels
was exchanged for restricted stock of priceline.com International in the third
quarter of 2005.

During
2004, the Company issued 12,000 shares of restricted common stock to its Board
of Directors.  The restricted stock has a
four-year vesting period.  The accrual
for deferred compensation expense related to the shares issued was recorded at
the market value on the date of the grant in the amount of $27.10 per share and
the related compensation expense is being amortized over the vesting period.

In
2003, the Company issued an aggregate of 83,333 shares of restricted common
stock to its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer.  The restricted stock has a four-year vesting
period.

The accrual for deferred compensation expense related
to the shares issued was recorded at the market value on the date of the grant
in the amount of $20.28 per share and the related compensation expense is being
amortized over the vesting period.

During
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded stock based compensation expense of
$4,169,000, $638,000 and $282,000, respectively.

5.

RESTRUCTURING

At
December 31, 2005 the Company has a restructuring liability of $1.8 million for
the estimated remaining costs related to leased property vacated in connection
with the Company’s 2000 restructuring. In September 2005, the Company recorded
a $2.0 million restructuring charge based upon a re-evaluation of the estimated
costs related to the vacated leased property. 
In the first quarter of 2005, the Company decreased the liability for
the restructuring charge by $336,000 based upon a re-evaluation of estimated
costs to complete certain European restructuring activities.

The
Company estimates, based on current available information, the remaining net
cash outflows associated with its restructuring related commitments will be
paid in 2006-2011. The current portion of the restructuring accrual in the
amount of $0.6 million is recorded in “Accrued expenses” and the $1.2 million
non-current portion is recorded in “Other long-term liabilities” on the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The
Company recorded a reserve of approximately $2.5 million for severance and
contract terminations related to the acquisition of Travelweb in May
2004.  The Company identified and notified the affected Travelweb
personnel and vendors in 2004.  Such exiting costs will be paid out in
cash and approximately $2.3 million was paid as of December 31, 2005.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVES

The Company accrues for costs associated with purchases made in its
websites by individuals using fraudulent credit cards and for other amounts “charged
back” as a result of payment disputes. 
Additionally, the Company is liable for the cost of accepting fraudulent
credit cards in certain retail transactions when it does not act as merchant of
record.  The Company also records a
provision for uncollectible commissions. 
Changes in accounts receivable reserves consisted of the following (in
thousands):


8.             NET INCOME PER SHARE

The
Company computes both basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with
SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share.” Basic earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share
is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent
shares outstanding during the year which is calculated using the treasury stock
method for stock options, warrants, restricted stock units and restricted
stock.  Common equivalent shares for
which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have
an anti-dilutive effect on EPS and, accordingly, are excluded from the
calculation.  The shares that would be
issued upon the conversion of the Company’s 1% and 2.25% Convertible Senior
Notes (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) are included in
the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the if converted method if
their inclusion is dilutive to earnings per share.

A
reconciliation of net income and the weighted average number of shares
outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share is as follows (in
thousands):


9.             PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT

Property
and equipment at December 31, 2005 and 2004 consists of the following (in
thousands):

Fixed
asset depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $8.7 million,
$9.1 million and $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

10.

INTANGIBLE
ASSETS

The
Company’s intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands):


Intangible
assets with determinable lives are primarily amortized on a straight-line
basis.  In December 2005, the Company
reassessed the useful lives of acquired domain names and trade names.  Based on this reassessment, the Company
determined the useful lives of its domain names to be 10 years and trade names
to be 5 years.  The impact of this change
amounted to approximately $200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.  Intangible assets amortization expense was
approximately $18.6 million, $5.3 million and $453,000 for the years

ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

The
annual estimated amortization expense for the amortizable acquired intangible
assets for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):

11.

GOODWILL

A
substantial majority of the Company’s goodwill relates to its acquisitions of
Travelweb and Active Hotels in 2004 and Bookings in 2005.

A
roll forward of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
consists of the following (in thousands):


During
the year ended December 31, 2005, goodwill and deferred taxes were reduced by
approximately $4.8 million as a result of a purchase price allocation
adjustment related to the assignment of fair values to the acquired assets and
liabilities of Active Hotels. Impairment tests performed in 2005 and 2004 did
not result in any adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill.

12.

OTHER ASSETS

Other assets at December
31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 consist of the following (in thousands):

Investment in
pricelinemortgage.com represents the Company’s 49% equity investment in
pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, the Company recognizes its pro rata
share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed an amount
that the Company believes represents the investment’s estimated fair
value.  The Company recognized
approximately $1.3 million, $8,000 and $3.1 million of income from its
investment in pricelinemortgage.com in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company earned advertising fees from
pricelinemortgage.com of approximately $53,000, $100,000 and $534,000 in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

The excess of the carrying value
of the Company’s equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com over its equity in
the underlying net assets was approximately $1.1 million as of December 31,
2005 and 2004.

Deferred debt issuance costs
arose from the Company’s issuance of $125 million aggregate principal amount of
1% Notes in August 2003 and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25%
Notes in June 2004.  Deferred debt
issuance costs of approximately $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively,
consisting primarily of underwriting commissions and professional service fees,
are being amortized using the effective interest rate method over approximately
five years.

13.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

In August 2003, the Company
issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1% (the “1%
Notes”).  The 1% Notes are convertible,
subject to certain conditions, into the Company’s common stock, par value
$0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of
approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of 1% Notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of the Company’s
common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing price of the
Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period is more than 110%
of the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes, or after August 1, 2008,
if the closing price of the Company’s common stock is more than 110% of the
then current conversion price of the 1% Notes. 
The 1% Notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances, such
as a change in control of the Company. 
In addition, the 1% Notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option
beginning in 2008, and the holders may require the Company to repurchase the 1%
Notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances.  Interest on the 1% Notes is payable on
February 1 and August 1 of each year.

In November 2003, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby it swapped the fixed 1%
interest on its 1% Notes for a floating interest rate based on the 3-month U.S.
Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of 221 basis points, on $45 million
notional value of debt.  This agreement
expires August 1, 2010.  The Company
designated this interest rate swap agreement as a


fair value hedge.  The changes in
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the underlying debt are
recorded as offsetting gains and losses in interest income and expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations.  Hedge
ineffectiveness of $3,000 was recorded as interest income for the year ended
December 31, 2005.  Hedge ineffectiveness
of $2,000 was recorded as interest income for the year ended December 31,
2004.  The fair value cost to terminate
this swap as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, was approximately $1.5 million and
$0.7 million, respectively, and has been recorded as a credit in other
long-term liabilities with a related adjustment to the carrying value of debt.

In June 2004, the Company
issued, in a private placement, $100 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025, with an interest rate of 2.25%
(the “2.25% Notes”).  The 2.25% Notes are
convertible, subject to certain conditions, into the Company’s common stock,
par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price
of approximately $37.95 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of 2.25% Notes will initially be convertible into 26.3505 shares of the
Company’s common stock if, on or prior to January 15, 2025, certain conditions
occur.  The 2.25% Notes are also
convertible in certain other circumstances, such as a change in control of the
Company.  In the event that all or
substantially all of the Company’s common stock is acquired prior to January
15, 2010, in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the
Company’s common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company
would be required to make additional payments to the holders of the 2.25% Notes
of amounts ranging from $0 to $17.6 million depending upon the date of the
transaction and the then current stock price of the Company.  The Company’s obligation to make this payment
is treated as an embedded derivative which, pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities (“SFAS 133”), must be assigned its own value separate and apart from
the value of the 2.25% Notes.  The
estimated value of the derivative has been established based upon several
quantitative and qualitative factors and will be amortized as interest expense
ratably over approximately a 5 ½ year period. 
Pursuant to SFAS 133, any subsequent changes in the value of the
derivative is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the change
in value occurs.  Amortization expense
and the effect of marking the instrument to market has not been material in any
period.  In addition, the 2.25% Notes
will be redeemable at the Company’s option beginning January 20, 2010, and the
holders may require the Company to repurchase the 2.25% Notes on January 15,
2010, 2015 or 2020, or in certain other circumstances.  Interest on the 2.25% Notes is payable on
January 15 and July 15 of each year.

The Company used a portion
of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in
the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels in 2004, and in the acquisition
of Bookings in July 2005.  The remaining
proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses and
working capital requirements.

14.           TREASURY STOCK

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock from time to time
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Under this program, the Company repurchased
warrants for $12.2 million (see Note 16) in December 2005.

The
Company may make additional repurchases of shares under its stock repurchase
program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital
and other factors.  Whether and when to
initiate and/or complete any purchase of common stock and the amount of common
stock purchased will be determined in the Company’s complete discretion.

As
of December 31, 2005, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the
Company’s common stock held in treasury.


15.           REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
STOCK

In
2001, the Company issued Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) 80,000 shares of
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share (“Series B Preferred
Stock”) and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase approximately 4.5 million
shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $17.81 per
share.  The exercise price of the
Warrants is paid by surrendering .0178125 shares of Series B Preferred Stock
for each share of the Company’s common stock purchased.

The
Series B Preferred Stock has special preferences. Specifically, the Series B
Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount
equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid and is subject to
mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. 
The Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends payable in shares of the
Company’s common stock at a rate of 11% per annum commencing February 6, 2001.
Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable semi­annually on February
6 and August 6 of each year starting August 6, 2001.

The
Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company or the
holder, in whole or in part, at any time upon a change of control of the
Company at $1,000 per share in cash, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and
dividends that would have accrued through February 6, 2007. Other than as
described below, the Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of
the Company’s common stock or any other security of the Company. Holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote on any matter, except in
certain limited circumstances and as specifically required under Delaware
General Corporate Law.  Holders of Series
B Preferred Stock are entitled to specified cash payments in the event of
certain business combination transactions involving the Company.

Pursuant
to the terms of the certificate of designations relating to the Series B
Preferred Stock, the dividend that is payable through the issuance of shares of
the Company’s common stock each year is subject to adjustment as provided for
in the certificate of designations (and as described below as the result of
exercise of the Warrants).  In the event
the Company consummates any of certain business combination transactions, the
Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company or Delta
at the $1,000 liquidation preference per outstanding share plus all dividends
accrued but not paid on the shares.  In
such an event, Delta would be entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of
the dividend payments that would have accrued or accumulated on the shares to
be redeemed through the remaining scheduled dividend payment dates.

During
2001, Delta exercised Warrants to purchase approximately 3.1 million shares of
the Company’s common stock and on January 29, 2002, Delta exercised Warrants to
purchase 666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, there are
13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding with an aggregate
liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million and the Company’s future
semi-annual dividend requirement is 40,240 shares of common stock.  In accordance with the terms of the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Company delivered to Delta the required shares of the
Company’s common stock as dividend payments. The Company recorded non-cash
dividends of approximately $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
Warrants provide that at any time the closing sales price of the Company’s
common stock has exceeded $53.44 (subject to adjustment) for 20 consecutive
trading days, the Warrants will automatically be exercised.  As of December 31, 2005, there were 756,199
Warrants outstanding.

16.           OTHER WARRANTS TO
PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

In
addition to the Warrants related to the

Series B Preferred Stock

, Delta also
holds warrants to purchase 779,166 shares of the Company’s common stock at an
exercise price of $28.31 per share. 
These warrants became exercisable in November 2004.


In
March 2003, in connection with the renewal of a marketing agreement with
Marriott International, Inc. (“Marriott”), the Company issued Marriott 833,333
warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price
of $9.84 per share.  The warrants, which
were not transferable, were fully vested, non-forfeitable, and would have
become exercisable no earlier than three years from the date of issuance
(subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a reorganization,
recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving priceline.com).  In connection with the issuance of the
warrants, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $6.6 million in 2003
determined by using an option pricing model. 
In December 2005, the Company repurchased the warrants at their
then-current fair value of $12.2
million.  The repurchase price was paid
in cash and upon repurchase, all of the warrants were cancelled.

17.           STOCK OPTION PLANS

Priceline.com
has adopted the following stock option plans from which broad-based employee
grants may be made:  The 1997 Omnibus
Plan (the “1997 Plan”), the 1999 Omnibus Plan (the “1999 Plan”) and the 2000
Employee Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan,” and together with the 1997 Plan
and the 1999 Plan, the “Stock Option Plans”), each of which provides for grants
of options as incentives and rewards to encourage employees, officers,
consultants and directors in the long-term success of the Company. At a Special
Meeting of the stockholders of the Company on January 24, 2005, the
stockholders approved an amendment to the 1999 Plan to increase the number of
authorized shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance under the
1999 Plan by two million shares.  The 1997 Plan, 1999 Plan and 2000 Plan
provide for grants of options to purchase up to 3,979,166, 7,895,833 and
1,000,000 shares of priceline.com common stock, respectively, at a purchase
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.

18.           TAXES

Domestic
pre-tax income was $31.3 million, $38.9 million and $14.1 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Foreign pre-tax income was $5.1 million for
the year-ended December 31, 2005, and foreign pre-tax loss was $7.6 million and
$2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The tax
provision (benefit) at December 31, 2005 is as follows (in thousands):

The

The tax
effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as
follows (in thousands):

The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability in the amount of
$42.4 million and $25.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
primarily related to the assignment of estimated fair value to certain
purchased identifiable intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of
Active Hotels and Bookings.  At December
31, 2005, no provision had been made for U.S. taxes on approximately $23.5
million of foreign earnings, which are expected to be reinvested
indefinitely.  The amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is not expected to be
material.

The Company has
significant deferred tax assets, resulting principally from domestic net
operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). 
As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” the Company
periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax
assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance to the extent the Company believes a portion will not be
realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of
future realization of its deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative
earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable
income, the carryforward periods available to it for tax reporting purposes,
and other relevant factors. The Company concluded in the third quarter 2005,
based upon its assessment of positive and negative evidence, that it is more
likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be
realized.  Accordingly, the Company
recorded a non-cash tax benefit in the third quarter 2005 of $170.5 million,
resulting from a reversal of a portion of its valuation allowance on its
deferred tax assets.  It is the Company’s
belief that it is more likely than not that its remaining deferred tax assets
will not be realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance against those
assets remains.  The valuation allowance
may need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change,
causing a reassessment of the realization of its deferred tax assets.  The deferred tax asset at December 31, 2005
amounted to $158.7 million.  The current
portion amounting to $12.1 million is recorded in prepaid expenses and other
current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, the valuation allowance decreased by
approximately $351 million resulting from the aforementioned recognition of
certain deferred tax assets and the write-off of certain deferred tax assets
related to expiring state NOLs and capital loss carryforwards for which a
corresponding valuation allowance had been recorded.  The valuation allowance decreased by
approximately $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

At
December 31, 2005 the Company had approximately $3.1 billion of net operating
loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from December 31, 2019 to
December 31, 2021 which are subject to limitation on future utilization under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Section 382 imposes limitations on the
availability of a company’s net operating losses after a more than 50
percentage point ownership change occurs. 
As a result of a study (the “NOL Study”), it was determined that
ownership changes, as defined in Section 382, occurred in 2000 and 2002.  The amount


of
the Company’s net operating losses incurred prior to each ownership change is
limited (the “Loss Limitation”) based on the value of the Company on the
respective dates of ownership change.  It
is estimated that the effect of Section 382 will generally limit the amount of
net operating loss which is available to offset future taxable income to
approximately $69 million annually.  The
estimate of the annual Loss Limitation is based upon certain conclusions in the
NOL Study pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the
Company on the dates of the ownership changes. 
The overall determination of the Loss Limitation and conclusions
contained in the NOL Study are subject to interpretation, and therefore, the
annual Loss Limitation could be subject to change.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $6 million of U.S. capital
loss carryforwards, which expire from December 31, 2006 to December 31,
2007.  At December 31, 2005, the Company
also had approximately $1.4 million of U.S. research credit carryforwards.  Such credit carryforwards expire from
December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. 
These U.S. capital loss and U.S. research credit carryforwards are also
subject to annual limitation.

Approximately $774
million of the Company’s tax net operating losses at December 31, 2005 relate
to the exercise of stock options which have been granted under the Company’s
various stock option plans and gives rise to compensation which has been
included in the taxable income of the applicable current and former employees
and deducted by the Company for federal and state income tax purposes.  Additionally, approximately $1.06 billion of
the Company’s tax net operating losses relate to the excess of tax deductions
from the exercise of certain stock warrants granted by the Company in excess of
the associated warrant costs recorded for financial accounting purposes.
Finally, the Company recorded $6.8 million of costs for financial reporting
purposes in excess of the amount deductible for tax purposes related to the
vesting of restricted stock held by certain employees of the Company.

Net operating
losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards with anticipated
expirations are presented below (in thousands).

Tax benefit, if realized, will be recorded

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

Acquisitions of Active Hotels
and Bookings.

The
holders of stock of priceline.com International issued in connection with the
Company’s acquisition of Bookings can require the Company to purchase their
stock at certain future dates for a purchase price equal to their then fair
market value.  In addition, the Company
can require the holders of the stock to sell the stock to the Company at
certain future dates for a purchase price equal to their then fair market
value.  The put and call dates range from
2006 to 2008.  Certain of the shares of
priceline.com International subject to this buyback provision include shares of
Active Hotels that were originally purchased by Active Hotels employees or were
granted at the time of the acquisition of Active Hotels and that were exchanged
for priceline.com International stock.  The Company estimates that at
December 31, 2005, the fair value of the securities subject to this buyback
provision approximated the carrying value of the Company’s minority interest
liability.

Litigation Related to Hotel Occupancy and Other Taxes

On
December 30, 2004, the City of Los Angeles filed a putative class action
complaint in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, on behalf of itself
and other allegedly similarly situated cities in California, naming as
defendants:  Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotel.com
GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Cendant Travel Distribution
Services Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a
Lodging.com); Lowestfare.com, Inc.; Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.;
Orbitz, LLC; priceline.com, Inc.; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com
LP; Travelweb, LLC and Travelnow.com, Inc. 
(

City of Los Angeles v. Hotels.com, Inc. et al

.).  The complaint alleged, among other things,
that each of these defendants violated the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax
Ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, and allegedly similar ordinances of other
California cities, with respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to
cover taxes under such ordinances, and that such practices also constitute acts
of unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code Section
17200,

et seq

. (“Section 17200”).  On May 19, 2005, the court ordered limited
discovery.  On August 31, 2005, the City
of Los Angeles filed an amended complaint adding a claim for a declaratory
judgment.  The amended complaint sought
payment of alleged unpaid taxes owed, relief from conversion, including
punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and imposition of a constructive trust.  On September 26, 2005, the court sustained
the defendants’ demurrers on the ground of improper joinder of defendants and
claims, and therefore, dismissed the amended complaint, with leave to file
amended complaint further addressing the joinder issue.  On February 8, 2006, the City of Los Angeles
filed a second amended complaint that asserts the same claims but includes
additional allegations of fact. 
Defendants intend to demurrer to the second amended complaint.


On
February 17, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the same
court by Ronald Bush and three other individuals on behalf of themselves and
other allegedly similarly situated California consumers against several of the
same defendants as named in the City of Los Angeles action, including the
Company (

Bush, et al. v. Cheaptickets, Inc., et al

.).  The complaint alleged each of the defendants
engaged in acts of unfair competition in violation of Section 17200 relating to
their respective disclosures and charges to customers to cover taxes under the
above ordinances of the City of Los Angeles and other California cities, and
service fees.  The complaint sought
restitution under Section 17200, relief for alleged conversion, including
punitive damages, injunctive relief, and imposition of a constructive
trust.  The defendants removed this
action to the United States District Court for the Central District of
California.  On May 9, 2005, the District
Court issued an order remanding the action to state court.  Defendants timely appealed to the Ninth
Circuit, which, on October 6, 2005, affirmed the order of the District
Court.  The case will therefore proceed
in the state court.  On July 1, 2005,
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding claims pursuant to California’s
Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code §1750,

et
seq

. and claims for breach of contract and the implied duty of good
faith and fair dealing.  On December 2,
2005, the court ordered limited discovery and ordered that motions challenging
the amended complaint would be coordinated with any similar motions filed in
the

City of Los Angeles

action.

Also
on February 17, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware for New Castle County by Jeanne
Marshall and three other individuals on behalf of themselves and a putative
class of allegedly similarly situated consumers nationwide against the Company
(

Marshall, et al. v. priceline.com, Inc

.).  The complaint alleged that the Company
violated the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 2511,

et seq

., relating to its disclosures and
charges to customers to cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances
nationwide, and service fees.  The
Company moved to dismiss the complaint on April 21, 2005.  The Company also moved to stay discovery
until a determination of its motion to dismiss the complaint and the Court
granted that stay on May 11, 2005.  On
June 10, 2005, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that asserts claims under
the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act and for breach of contract and the implied duty
of good faith and fair dealing.  The
amended complaint seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees
and other relief.  On July 15, 2005, the
Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that it
fails to allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action.  The Company’s motion to dismiss was heard by
the Court on November 4, 2005 and the parties are awaiting a decision.

On July 12, 2005, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filed a
complaint in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania
against Hotels.com; Hotels.com GP, LLC; Hotwire.com; Cheaptickets, Inc.;
Cendant Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork

Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; Travelweb, LLC and Travelnow.com,
Inc.  (

City of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania v. Hotels.com, et al

.). 
The complaint alleged, among other things, that each of these defendants
violated the hotel room rental tax provisions of Section 19-2401,

et seq

., of the Philadelphia Municipal
Code with respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes under
the Code.  The complaint also asserted
claims for conversion, imposition of a constructive trust, and a demand for a
legal accounting.  The complaint sought
payment of alleged unpaid taxes owed, disgorgement and restitution of all funds
allegedly owed to Plaintiff, an accounting, attorneys’ fees, and other
relief.  The defendants removed this
action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania.  On October 11, 2005, the
District Court issued an order remanding the action to state court.  On November 18, 2005, the City of
Philadelphia filed an amended complaint. 
On December 8, 2005, the defendants filed preliminary objections to the
amended complaint, and on January 9, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to
determine those preliminary objections. 
That motion has been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting a
decision.  On January 17, 2006, the Court
granted the defendants’ motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the
preliminary objections.


On September 21, 2005, the City of Bellingham, Washington filed a
putative class action complaint in the Superior Court of Washington for Whatcom
County on behalf of itself and other similarly situated taxing entities in
Washington, against Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.;
Cheaptickets Inc.; Cendant Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.; Expedia,

Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com, L.P.; Travelweb, LLC
and Travelnow.com, Inc. (

City of Bellingham v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al

.).  The complaint alleged, among other things,
that each of these defendants violated Section 4.62.010,

et seq

.,
of the Bellingham Municipal Code and similar laws of other Washington taxing
entities with respect to the charges and remittance of amounts to cover taxes
under the Municipal Code.  The complaint
also asserted claims for violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act
RCW § 19.86.010,

et seq

., conversion and unjust
enrichment.  The complaint sought

Litigation Related to Securities Matters

On March 16, March 26, April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four
putative class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock,
Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ.
3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other
defendants and states claims unrelated to the Company.  The complaints allege, among other things,
that priceline.com and the individual defendants violated the federal
securities laws by issuing and selling priceline.com common stock in
priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public offering without disclosing to
investors that some of the underwriters in the offering, including the lead
underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received excessive and undisclosed
commissions from certain investors.  By
Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these cases
were consolidated for pre-trial purposes with hundreds of other cases, which
contain allegations concerning the allocation of shares in the initial public
offerings of companies other than priceline.com, Inc.  By Order of Judge Scheindlin dated August 14,
2001, the following cases were consolidated for all purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ.
3590.  On April 19, 2002, plaintiffs
filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with respect
to both the Company’s March 1999 initial public offering and the Company’s
August 1999 second public offering of common stock.  The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc.,
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman,
Timothy G. Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs &
Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc.
(as successor-in-interest to BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as
successor-in-interest to Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.),
Allen & Co., Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  Priceline, Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul
Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier, together with other issuer
defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a joint motion to dismiss on
July 15, 2002.  On November 18, 2002, the
cases against the individual defendants were dismissed without prejudice and
without costs.  In addition, counsel for
plaintiffs and the individual defendants executed Reservation of Rights and
Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes of limitations on plaintiffs’
claims against those individuals.  On
February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin issued an Opinion and Order granting


in
part and denying in part the issuer’s motion. 
None of the claims against the Company were dismissed.  On June 26, 2003, counsel for the plaintiff
class announced that they and counsel for the issuers had agreed to the form of
a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to settle claims against the
issuers.  The terms of that Memorandum
provide that class members will be guaranteed $1 billion in recoveries by the
insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants will assign to the
class members certain claims that they may have against the underwriters.  Issuers also agree to limit their abilities
to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion are
obtained by the class from any non-settling defendants, the settling defendants’
monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount
recovered from the underwriters that is less than $1 billion will be paid by
the insurers on behalf of the issuers. 
The Memorandum, which is subject to the approval of each issuer, was
approved by a special committee of the priceline.com Board of Directors on
Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Thereafter,
counsel for the plaintiff class and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form
of a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and
Individuals (“Settlement Agreement”). 
The Settlement Agreement implements the Memorandum and contains the same
material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a
special committee of the priceline.com Board of Directors authorized the
Company’s counsel to execute the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the
Company.  The Settlement Agreement is
subject to final approval by the Court and the process to obtain that approval
is still pending.

Subsequent to the Company’s
announcement on September 27, 2000, that revenues for the third quarter 2000
would not meet expectations, it was served with the following putative class
action complaints:


All of these cases have been assigned to Judge
Dominic J. Squatrito.  On September 12,
2001, Judge Squatrito ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master
File No. 3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead
plaintiffs’ counsel.  On October 29,
2001, plaintiffs served a Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On February 5, 2002, Amerindo Investment
Advisors, Inc., who was one of the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action,
made a motion for leave to withdraw as lead plaintiff.  The Court granted that motion on May 30,
2002.  On February 28, 2002, the Company
filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On October 7, 2004, the Court issued a
Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying, in part, the Company’s
motion.  A scheduling order was entered
by the Court on November 2, 2004 and the parties are now proceeding with
discovery.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for
class certification on January 7, 2005, and the Company has filed its
opposition to that motion.  The Company
intends to defend vigorously against this action.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of these suits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

In addition, on November 1, 2000 the Company was served
with a complaint that purported to be a shareholder derivative action against
its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former executive
officers, as well as the Company (as a nominal defendant).  The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary
duty and waste of corporate assets.  The
action is captioned

Mark
Zimmerman v. Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D. Schulman, P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P.
Blackney, W. Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N. Peretsman, and priceline.com
Incorporated, 18473-NC (Court of Chancery of Delaware, County of New Castle,
State of


Delaware). 
On February 6, 2001, all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for
failure to make a demand upon the Board of Directors and failure to state a
cause of action upon which relief can be granted.  Pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, an
amended complaint was filed on June 21, 2001. 
Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss on August 20, 2001, and
plaintiff served his opposition to that motion on October 26, 2001.  Defendants filed their reply brief on January
7, 2002.  On December 20, 2002, the Court
granted defendants’ motion without prejudice. 
On April 25, 2003, a second amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was
filed and a motion seeking leave of court to file the second amended complaint
was filed on July 28, 2003.  That motion
was fully briefed, and oral argument took place on May 9, 2005. Immediately
following oral argument, the Court dismissed three of the four counts in the
second amended complaint.  All of the
counts against defendants Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller,
Peretsman and Schulman have now been dismissed. 
On September 8, 2005, the Court granted plaintiff leave to file the
second amended complaint as to the one remaining count.  Defendants filed a motion requesting that the
Court certify its September 8, 2005 order for interlocutory appeal to the
Delaware Supreme Court, and the Court granted that motion on October 6,
2005.  On October 17, 2005, the Delaware
Supreme Court accepted the interlocutory appeal.  Defendants’ opening brief on appeal is due on
November 21, 2005.  Discovery in the case
and the time in which Defendants are required to respond to the second amended
complaint have been stayed pending the Delaware Supreme Court’s entry of
mandate.   The Company intends to defend
vigorously against this action.  The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of the suit or reasonably estimate a
range of possible loss, if any.

On November 7, 2003, the Company was served with a complaint
that purported to be a shareholder derivative action against its Board of
Directors and certain of its current and former executive officers, as well as
the Company (as a nominal defendant). 
The complaint alleged, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty,
waste of corporate assets and misappropriation of corporate information.

The claims in the complaint appear to be substantially repetitive of
the claims pending in the derivative action in Delaware which is described
above.

The
action is captioned Don Powell

v. Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker,
Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney, William
E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and Heidi G.
Miller and priceline.com Incorporated (Superior Court, Judicial District of
Stamford/Norwalk, State of Connecticut). 
On January 28, 2004, defendants Blackney, Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb
moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.  On January 29, 2004, defendant Miller moved
to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and for insufficient
service of process.  On February 27,
2004, defendants Braddock, Walker, Schulman, Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Loeb,
Nicholas, Peretsman, Miller and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman
also moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and
insufficient service of process.  At a
hearing on May 3, 2004, the Court stated that it would not rule on the pending
motions until the pending motions in the Delaware action described above are
decided.  The Court conducted a
subsequent status conference on January 10, 2005, at which it requested that the
parties report back no later than March 15, 2005 on the status of the Delaware
derivative suit.  On March 15, 2005, the
parties informed the Court in writing that the oral argument in the Delaware
case had been postponed until May 9, 2005, and that the parties would contact
the Court with a status report after that hearing was held.  The Delaware Court dismissed three of the
four counts in the second amended complaint in the Delaware derivative
suit.  All of the counts against the
defendants Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller, Peretsman and Schulman
have now been dismissed.  The parties in
the Connecticut action advised the Connecticut Court of the Delaware Court’s
ruling by letter dated June 6, 2005.  The
Delaware Court subsequently granted plaintiff leave to file the second amended
complaint as to the one remaining count. 
Defendants sought an interlocutory appeal of the Delaware Court’s order,
and the Delaware Supreme Court accepted that appeal.  The parties in the Connecticut action advised
the Connecticut Court of those developments by letter dated November 3,
2005.  The Company intends to defend
vigorously against this action.  The
Company is unable to predict the outcome of this suit or reasonably estimate a
range of possible loss, if any.


Other Litigation

On January 6, 1999, the Company received
notice that a third party patent applicant and patent attorney, Thomas G.
Woolston, purportedly had filed in December 1998 with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office a request to declare an interference between a
patent application filed by Woolston and the Company’s U.S. Patent
5,794,207.  The Company is currently
awaiting information from the Patent Office regarding whether it will initiate
an interference proceeding.

From time to time, the Company has been and expects to
continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of business, including claims of alleged infringement of third party
intellectual property rights by it.  Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from the
Company’s business objectives and could adversely affect the Company’s
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Uncertainty regarding payment of sales and hotel occupancy
and other related taxes.

On
an ongoing basis, the Company conducts a review and interpretation of the tax
laws in various states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state
and local hotel occupancy and other related taxes.  In connection with its review, the Company
has met and had discussions with taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions
but the ultimate resolution in any particular jurisdiction cannot be determined
at this time.  Currently, hotels collect
and remit hotel occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities
based on the amounts collected by the hotels. 
Consistent with this practice, the Company recovers the taxes on the
underlying cost of the hotel room night from customers and pays that amount to
the hotel operators for payment to the appropriate tax authorities.  As discussed at length above, several
jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits indicating the position that sales tax or
hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by
a customer for the Company’s service and the cost to the Company of the
underlying room.  Historically, the
Company has not collected taxes on this differential.  Additional state and local jurisdictions
could assert that the Company is subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on
this differential and could seek to collect such taxes, either retroactively or
prospectively or both.  Such actions may
result in substantial liabilities for past and/or future sales and could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of
operations.  To the extent that any tax
authority succeeds in asserting that any such tax collection responsibility
exists, it is likely that, with respect to future transactions, the Company
would collect any such additional tax obligation from its customers, which
would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room nights to the
Company’s customers and, consequently, could reduce its hotel sales.  The Company will continue to assess the risks
of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent
appropriate, it will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Worldspan, L.P. Agreement

In
October 2001, the Company entered into a long-term worldwide technology
agreement with Worldspan, L.P., pursuant to which Worldspan, L.P. acts as the
Company’s primary global distribution system and provides the Company with
product development resources.  The
current agreement, as amended, expires on December 31, 2007, and requires the
Company to use Worldspan, L.P. for a significant majority of its travel
bookings originated in the United States. 
In return, the Company earns a fee for such bookings.

Employment Contracts

The
Company has employment agreements with certain members of senior management
that provide for cash severance payments of up to approximately $10.3 million,
accelerated vesting of stock


options
upon, among other things, death or a termination other than for “cause” or “good
reason”, as those terms are defined in the agreements, and a gross-up for the
payment of golden parachute excise taxes. 
In addition, the agreements provide for the extension of health and
insurance benefits after termination for periods of up to three years and, in
some instances, gross-up for excise taxes that may be imposed.

Operating Leases

The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment through operating leases.
Rental expense for operating leases was approximately $2.8 million, $2.3
million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company’s executive, administrative, operating offices and
network operations center are located in approximately 92,000 square feet of
leased office space located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  Minimum payments for operating leases having
initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows
(in thousands):
