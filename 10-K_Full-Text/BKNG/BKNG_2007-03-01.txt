Special Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference
contain forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that are difficult to predict, including the Risk Factors identified in Item 1A
of this Annual Report; therefore, actual results may differ materially from
those expressed, implied or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements.

Expressions
of future goals, expectations and similar expressions including, without
limitation, “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “expects,” “does not currently
expect,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,”
“potential,” “targets,” or “continue,” reflecting something other than
historical fact are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The
following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: adverse
changes in general market conditions for leisure and other travel services as
the result of, among other things, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or the
outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic disease; adverse changes in our
relationships with airlines and other product and service providers which could
include, without limitation, the withdrawal of suppliers from the priceline.com
system (either priceline.com’s retail or “opaque” services, or both); the loss
or reduction of global distribution fees; the bankruptcy or insolvency of
another major domestic airline; the effects of increased competition;
systems-related failures and/or security breaches, including without
limitation, any security breach that results in the theft, transfer or
unauthorized disclosure of customer information, or the failure to comply with
various state laws applicable to the company’s obligations in the event of such
a breach; difficulties integrating recent acquisitions, such as Booking.com
Limited (formerly known as Active Hotels Ltd.) and Booking.com B.V. (formerly
known as Bookings B.V.), including, ensuring the effectiveness of the design
and operation of internal controls and disclosure controls of acquired
businesses; a change by a major search engine to its search engine algorithms
that negatively affects the search engine ranking of the company or its third
party distribution partners; legal and regulatory risks; and the ability to
attract and retain qualified personnel. These factors and others are described
in more detail below under the heading “Risk Factors.”  Unless required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, readers should
carefully review the reports and documents we file or furnish from time to time
with the SEC, particularly our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current
reports on Form 8-K.

PART I

Item
1.  Business

General

We
are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad range of
travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation
packages, cruises and destination services. 
We offer our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel
services in a traditional, price-disclosed manner, both in the United States
and Europe, or the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your Own Price

®

service, which allows our customers to make
offers for travel services at discounted prices.  At present, we derive substantially all of
our revenues from the following sources:

·

Transaction revenues from our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as
well as our vacation packages service;


·

Commissions earned from the sale
of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel services;

·

Customer processing fees
charged in connection with the sale of both

Name
Your Own Price

®

and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel
rooms and rental cars services;

·

Transaction revenue from our
price-disclosed hotel room service;

·

Global distribution system (“GDS”)
reservation booking fees related to both our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car
service, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and

·

Other revenues derived
primarily from selling advertising on our websites.

For the year ended
December 31, 2006, we had revenues of approximately $1.1 billion comprised of “merchant”
revenue, “agency” revenue and “other” revenue. 
Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the
merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things, collecting
receipts from our customers and remitting payments to our suppliers.  Merchant revenues, which represented the
substantial majority of our total revenues in 2006, consisted of: (1)

transaction
revenues representing the selling price of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms,
rental cars and price-disclosed vacation packages services; (2) transaction
revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged
by suppliers in connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in
connection with the sale of

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars
and merchant price-disclosed hotels services; and (4) ancillary fees, including
GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the transactions described
above

.  Agency revenues are generally derived from
retail travel related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and
where the prices of our services are determined by third parties. Agency revenues
consisted primarily of: (1) travel commissions; (2) customer processing fees;
and (3) GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned
transactions.

Other revenues
consisted primarily of revenue from advertising on our websites.

Priceline.com was formed
as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted into a
Delaware corporation in July 1998.  Our
common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “PCLN.”  Our principal executive offices are located
at 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06854.

The
priceline.com Website

We maintain a
website with the address www.priceline.com, among others.  We are not including the information
contained on our websites as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into,
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We make
available free of charge through the www.priceline.com website our Annual
Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on
Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with,
or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission

. 
These reports and other information are also available, free of charge,
at www.sec.gov.  Alternatively, the public may read and copy any materials
we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20549.  Information on the operation of the Public
Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.


The
priceline.com Business Model

We offer customers
the ability

to purchase
travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental car days,
vacations packages, destination services and cruises, through both a
traditional, price-disclosed “retail” manner, and through our proprietary
demand-collection system known as

Name
Your Own Price

®

.  These services are made available over the
Internet through websites that we own or control, and are provided by major
travel suppliers, including more than 200 airline carriers and more than 60,000
hotel properties worldwide.  We believe
that the combination of our retail price-disclosed model and our

Name Your Own Price

®

model allows us to provide a broad array of
options to value-conscious travelers, while providing us with diverse streams
of revenue.

Price-Disclosed
Retail Travel Services

. 
We offer customers the ability to
purchase price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental car days,
vacations packages, destination services and cruises at retail prices.  In these transactions, the customer typically
selects airline flights, hotel reservations, or other travel itineraries from
an array of results produced in response to the customer’s request.  These results include the identity of the
travel supplier, the exact price of the itinerary, and other details relating
to the itineraries.  In some
circumstances, the customer pays us the price of the itinerary at the time of
reservation, and in other circumstances, the customer pays the travel supplier
directly at the time of travel.

We
also offer a retail, price-disclosed hotel service in Europe through our
European operations, which we have developed through two recent
acquisitions.  In

September 2004, we acquired Booking.com
Limited (formerly known as Active Hotels Ltd.), a Cambridge, England based
Internet hotel reservation distributor, and in July 2005, we acquired Amsterdam-based Booking.com B.V. (formerly
known as Bookings B.V.), one of continental Europe’s leading Internet hotel
reservation services, with offices primarily in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin,
Loule, Paris, Rome and Vienna.  All of
our European operations, including Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V.,
are majority-owned by us.  We work with
over 25,000 chain-owned and independently owned hotels offering hotel
reservations on various websites and in multiple languages.  For
geographic related information, see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Our European operations represented approximately 40.6% of our gross
bookings in the year ended December 31, 2006, and were a substantial
contributor to our consolidated operating income during that period and we
expect that throughout 2007 they will represent a growing percentage of our
total gross bookings and operating income.

Name Your Own Price

®

.  We have developed a unique pricing system
known as a “demand collection system” that uses the information sharing and
communications power of the Internet to create a new way of pricing products
and services.  We believe our services
have created a balance between the interests of buyers, who are willing to
accept trade-offs in order to save money, and sellers, who are prepared to
generate incremental revenue by selling their products at below retail prices,
provided that they can do so without disrupting their existing distribution
channels or retail pricing structures. 
Our demand collection system allows consumers to specify the price they
are prepared to pay when submitting an offer for a particular leisure travel
service within a specified range of substitutability.  We then access databases in which
participating suppliers file secure discounted rates not generally available to
the public, to determine whether we can fulfill the customer’s offer and decide
whether we want to accept the offer at the price designated by the
consumer.  For most of these
transactions, we have discretion in supplier selection and are the merchant of
record in the transaction.  Consumers
agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time (generally, not
longer than one minute) to enable us to determine whether we can or want to
accept the offer.  Once fulfilled, offers
generally cannot be canceled — thereby making such purchases generally
non-refundable.


This system uses
the flexibility of buyers to enable sellers to accept a lower price in order to
sell their excess inventory or capacity. 
We believe that our demand collection system addresses limitations
inherent in traditional seller-driven pricing mechanisms in a manner that
offers substantial benefits to both buyers and sellers.  We believe that the principal advantages of
our system include the following:

·

Cost Savings

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

demand collection
system allows consumers to save money in a simple and compelling way.  Buyers effectively trade off flexibility
about brands, product features and/or sellers in return for prices that are
lower than those that can be obtained at that time through traditional retail
distribution channels.

·

Incremental Revenue for Sellers

.  Sellers use our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand collection system as a revenue
management tool to generate incremental revenue without disrupting their
existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures.  We require consumers to be flexible with
respect to brands and product features. 
As a result, our

Name Your Own Price

®

system does not reveal sellers’ brands to
customers prior to the consummation of a transaction, thereby protecting their
brand integrity.  This shielding of brand
identity and price enables sellers to sell products and services at discounted
prices without cannibalizing their own retail sales by publicly announcing
discount prices and without competing against their own distributors.

·

Proprietary Seller Networks

.  We have assembled proprietary networks of
industry leading sellers that represent high quality brands.  By establishing attractive networks of seller
participants with reputations for quality, scale and national presence, we
believe that we foster increased participation by both buyers and sellers.

We often refer to
products offered through our

Name Your Own
Price

®

service as “opaque” products because all
aspects of the travel service are not visible to the consumer before making an
offer.

The
priceline.com Strategy

The online travel
category has continued to experience significant worldwide growth as consumer
purchasing shifts from traditional off-line channels to interactive online
channels.  Priceline.com has been a
leader in the deep discount segment of this market and has embarked on a
strategy to participate more broadly in online travel growth by expanding its
service offerings and markets.

·

Continue to be One of the Top Online Hotel Reservation
Services in Europe

.  The size
of the travel market outside of the United States is substantially greater than
that within the United States. 
Historically, Internet adoption rates and e-commerce adoption rates of
international consumers have trailed those of the United States.  However, international consumers —
particularly European consumers — are rapidly moving to online means for
purchasing travel.  Accordingly, recent
international online travel growth rates have substantially exceeded and are
expected to continue to exceed the growth rates within the United States.  Prior to 2004, substantially all of our
revenues were generated within the United States.  In order to take advantage of the growth in
online travel outside of the United States, we acquired Internet hotel
reservation distributors Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V. in September
2004 and July 2005, respectively, giving us presence in the expanding European hotel
market with over 25,000 participating hotels across Europe.  Because of the superior growth rates
associated with international online travel, we intend to continue to invest
resources in increasing the share of our revenues represented by international
consumers and capitalize on intra-European travel demand and the growth of


travel between the United
States and Europe.  Specific initiatives
include geographic expansion, integration opportunities in Europe and with the
United States and building the Booking.com brand to enhance repeat business.

·

Expand Service Offerings

.  In 2003, we began to execute a plan to
broaden our array of service offerings beyond our

Name Your Own Price

®

services. 
Specifically, we have expended significant resources to allow us to
introduce price-disclosed retail services to our consumers to compliment the

Name Your Own Price

®

service. 
We believe that by offering a “one-stop-shopping” solution to our
customers, we can simultaneously fulfill the needs of those customers who are
prepared to accept the unique restrictions of our

Name Your Own Price

®

service in exchange for receiving significant
savings relative to retail prices, as well as those customers who are less
price sensitive and require the certainty of knowing the full details of their
travel itinerary prior to purchasing.  We
believe that our evolution to a “one-stop-shopping” website allows us to more
fully participate in the overall growth of the online travel category.

·

Offer

More Ways to
Save

.

Through the
www.priceline.com website, we offer our customers the unique ability to shop
and book price-disclosed or

Name Your Own
Price

®

travel services
in a single, integrated display.  We are
continuously improving the integration and display of these two services so that
our customers can quickly and easily find the way to save that is best suited
for each trip they take, while maximizing user conversion and
profitability.  In addition to our

Name Your Own Price

®

service, we offer additional money saving
alternatives, such as alternative airports or dates and discounted packaged
travel.  We intend to continue to develop
new money saving features for many of our services.

·

Enhance Service Offerings

.  We intend to continually enhance our service
offerings, particularly our more recently introduced retail offerings, by
adding competitive functionality, adding competitive content at competitive
pricing, adding and improving the content and merchandising on our website as
well as cross-sell opportunities to maximize customer conversion.

·

Competitive functionality:

We continue to
expend significant resources to remain competitive in terms of the features and
functionality we offer our customers. 
For example, since launching our retail air service, we have added the
ability to search for flexible dates or alternative airports, book one-way and
multi-destination itineraries and easily make modifications to search
criteria.  We intend to add additional
functionality such as the ability to search child and senior fares and to
access real time seat maps.

·

Competitive pricing:

We believe that
having a competitive selection of travel options at competitive pricing is
critical to our success.  For example, in
2006, we added nearly 1,000 additional destinations and nearly 6,000 additional
hotels to our vacation package service. 
In addition, we renewed or entered into new agreements with several of
our major airline and hotel suppliers in 2006, improving our access to a better
selection of travel alternatives and pricing.

·

Content and merchandising:

As part of our
evolution to a “one-stop-shopping” website, we have added thousands of pages of
content to allow customers to research destinations and hotel properties before
booking a reservation.  We offer property
descriptions, maps, images, and user reviews whereby our customers can benefit
from the experiences and opinions of other customers.  We introduced “PriceBreakers

sm

,” which is a presentation


of
selected travel itineraries at discounted prices that is updated daily.  We intend to continue to improve our content
and merchandising with more comprehensive descriptions, more and higher quality
images, and more user reviews, which we believe will improve conversion of
users shopping on our website.

·

Cross-sell opportunities

: We also cross-sell different
travel components to maximize the revenue we generate from each customer.  We have developed and implemented
functionality that allows customers to “add-on” travel components to their
selection, both during the shopping experience and at time of purchase.  For example, customers can add a rental car
reservation to their air or hotel reservation, or a hotel reservation to their
air reservation.  Customers can also add
destination related services such as shuttles, tours and activities.  Additionally, we cross-sell opaque services
on our retail path and retail services on our opaque path.  For example, an unsuccessful opaque air
customer may be offered a price-disclosed alternative, while a retail hotel
customer may be offered the

Name Your Own
Price

®

alternative
for greater savings.  We intend to
further enhance these cross-sell opportunities across all of our services.

·

Offer Travel Suppliers Valuable Distribution

.  We strive to be the preferred discount
distribution channel for airlines, hotels and rental car companies.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

service protects
supplier brand and published pricing and our packages and other merchandising
provide access to the brand neutral leisure traveler at attractive distribution
costs.

Service Offerings

Name Your Own Price

®

Hotels

.  Through our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service, customers can make
reservations at hotel properties in substantially all major cities and
metropolitan areas in the United States and Europe.  Most significant national hotel chains as
well as several important real estate investment trusts and independent
property owners participate in our

Name Your
Own Price

®

service.  Hotels participate by filing secure private
discounted rates with related inventory control rules in a global distribution
system database.  These specific rates
generally are not available to the general public or to consolidators and other
discount distributors who sell to the public, however, hotel participants may
make similar rates available to consolidators or other discount providers under
other arrangements.

Our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service operates in a manner
similar to our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service.  Consumers are required to accept certain
trade-offs with respect to brands or product features in return for saving
money.  For example, consumers are
required to accept a reservation in any hotel within a specified geographic
area within a designated “class” of service (1, 2, 3, 4, 5-star or “resort”)
and must accept limitations on changes and cancellations.  As with the airline ticket service, the
target market for our hotel room reservation service is the leisure travel
market.

Retail
Hotels.

In May 2004, we added a price-disclosed hotel
service through the acquisition of Travelweb LLC (“Travelweb”).  In March 2005, we launched a price-disclosed
hotel service on www.priceline.com that enables our customers to choose between
price-disclosed or

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel rooms. 
Our retail hotel service makes available both agency and merchant model
hotels.  Under the merchant model,
pursuant to merchant arrangements we make directly with individual hotel chains
and independent hotel properties, we receive access to participating hotels directly
from the hotels at a negotiated rate. 
Under the agency model, we receive access to hotel inventory at
generally


available rates, and
are paid a commission upon a customer’s check-out.  As with our retail airline ticket service,
hotel reservations booked in a retail manner do not have the restrictions
associated with

our

Name Your Own Price

®

service. 
Customers can select the exact hotel they want to book and the price of
the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

In addition, as
discussed above,

the
acquisitions of Booking.com Limited in September 2004, and Booking.com B.V. in
July 2005, gave us a foothold into the expanding European hotel market, as well
as access to European inventory.

Name Your Own Price

®

Airline Tickets

. 
There are a total of 12 domestic airlines and 29 international airlines
participating in our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service.

All

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket
requests are made through our websites. 
To make an offer, a customer specifies: (1) the origin and destination
of the trip, (2) the dates on which the customer wishes to depart and return,
(3) the price the customer is willing to pay, and (4) the customer’s valid
credit card to guarantee the offer.  When
making an offer, consumers must agree to:

·

fly
on any one of our participating airline partners;

·

leave
at any time of day between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on their desired dates of departure
and return;

·

purchase
only round trip coach class tickets between the same two points of departure
and return;

·

accept
at least one stop or connection;

·

receive
no frequent flier miles or upgrades; and

·

accept
tickets that cannot be refunded or changed.

When we receive an offer,
we determine whether to fulfill the offer based upon, among other things, the
available fares, rules and itineraries provided to us by our participating
airlines and certain other internal requirements.  A customer is usually notified whether his or
her offer has been accepted in near real-time. 
If we identify an airline ticket that meets the parameters specified by
the customer and that meets our internal requirements, the customer’s offer is
accepted and his or her credit card is charged the offer price, plus applicable
taxes, surcharges and processing fees, and the ticket is delivered to the
customer by the delivery method specified by the customer.  For customers who request it, we guarantee no
more than one connection per leg of trip with a maximum of a three-hour
stop.  As with our other

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services, once a customer’s offer for airline tickets is accepted, that offer,
in almost all cases, cannot be withdrawn or cancelled and the customer’s
purchase will not be refunded.

If a customer’s offer is
not accepted, but we believe the offer is reasonably close to a price that we
would be willing to accept, we will attempt to satisfy the customer by
providing guidance to the customer indicating that changing certain parameters
of the offer would increase the chances of the offer being accepted.  For example, in some cases we disclose to the
customer that agreeing to fly into an alternate airport would increase the
chances of his or her offer being accepted. 
In other cases, we inform the customer that increasing his or her offer
by a certain amount would increase the chances of it being accepted.  We may also offer a customer the opportunity
to purchase a price-disclosed retail airline ticket.


Retail
Airline Tickets.

Since

2003, we have also offered
our customers the ability to purchase retail airline tickets at disclosed
prices and with disclosed itineraries. 
In these transactions, we act as agent for the airline.  The airline sets the retail price paid by the
consumer and is the merchant of record for the transaction.  These airline tickets do not have the
restrictions associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

service. 
For example, in addition to having fully disclosed itineraries, retail
airline tickets are generally changeable and cancellable for a fee.

Name Your Own Price

®

Rental Cars

.  Our

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car service operates in a manner
similar to our airline ticket and hotel reservation services.  Our rental car services are currently
available in substantially all major United States airport markets.  The top five brand name airport rental car
companies in the United States are seller participants in our rental car
program.  Consumers can access our
website and select where and when they want to rent a car, what kind of car
they want to rent (e.g., economy, compact, mid-size, SUV, etc.) and the price
they want to pay per-day, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.  When we receive an offer, we determine
whether to fulfill the offer based upon the available rates and rules.  If a customer’s offer is accepted, we will
immediately reserve the rental car, charge the customer’s credit card and
notify the customer of the rental car company and location providing the rental
car.

Retail Rental Cars.

In 2004, we launched a price-disclosed rental
car service

on
www.priceline.com that enables our customers to choose between price-disclosed
or

Name Your Own Price

®

rental cars. 
In 2005, we upgraded our retail rental car service to accommodate
one-way and off-airport reservations. 
Our price-disclosed rental car service operates under the agency model,

under which we
earn a commission upon rental car return.

As with our
retail airline ticket and hotel reservation services, rental car reservations
booked in a retail manner do not have the restrictions associated with

our

Name Your Own Price

®

service. 
Customers can select the exact car they want to book and the price of
the reservation is disclosed prior to purchase.

With respect to each of
our airline, hotel and rental car services, we believe the combination of our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and the retail model allows us to provide a
broad array of options to value-conscious travelers, while providing us with
diverse streams of revenue.

Vacation
Packages

.  Our vacation package service allows consumers
to purchase packages consisting of airfare, hotel and rental car
components.  Consumers can select the
exact hotel or resort that they want to reserve, and then, in most cases, select
either a retail airline ticket or an opaque airline ticket for the air
component of their package. 
Additionally, consumers can add destination related services such as
tours, shuttles, and activities. 
Vacation packages are sold at disclosed prices, although consumers
cannot determine the exact price of the individual components.

Destination
Services

.  We currently offer customers the opportunity
to purchase destination services such as event tickets, ground transfers,
tours, restaurant meals and other services available at their travel
destinations.  This service is offered to
consumers as part of the process of booking an air, hotel and vacation
reservation, and also as a standalone service. 
In 2005, we expanded our destination services offering by adding parking
in certain locations and expanded ground transfer options.

Cruises

. 
We also offer price-disclosed cruise trips through National Leisure
Group, Inc. (“NLG”), an agent representing major cruise lines.  Our cruise service allows consumers to search
for and compare cruise pricing and availability information from 17 cruise
lines, and to purchase cruises online or through a call center by selecting
from our published offerings and prices. 
We receive commissions from NLG on successful cruise bookings.


Travel
Insurance

.  We offer our air, hotel and vacation package
customers an optional travel insurance package that provides coverage for,
among other things, trip cancellation, trip interruption, medical expenses,
emergency evacuation, and loss of baggage, property and travel documents.  The travel insurance is provided by member
companies of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”).  We receive a percentage of the premium from
AIG member companies for every optional insurance package purchased by our
customers.

While we are currently
focused on the travel services described above, over time, we may evaluate the
introduction of other services that we believe could enhance the travel
experience of our customers.

Financial
Services

We
offer financial services through Priceline Mortgage Company LLC, d/b/a
pricelinemortgage.com, of which we own 49% and hold two of five seats on the
board of managers.  Pursuant to an intellectual property license from us,
pricelinemortgage.com utilizes the priceline.com

Name Your Own Price

®

business model.  Pricelinemortgage.com is controlled by
EverBank, a federally chartered savings association supervised by the Office of
Thrift Supervision, and a wholly owned subsidiary of EverBank Financial
Corp.  Pricelinemortgage.com has access to the management resources and
expertise of EverBank, one of the nation’s largest privately held banking and
mortgage firms. EverBank Financial Corp. provides management services to
pricelinemortgage.com, including the procurement of personnel and office space
and assistance in obtaining regulatory approvals.  Pricelinemortgage.com
is operating in all 50 states.  Robert J. Mylod, our Chief Financial
Officer, is a director of, and an investor in, EverBank Financial Corp., the
parent company of EverBank.  Mr. Mylod’s investment represents less than
1/10 of one percent of EverBank Financial Corp.’s outstanding common stock.

Under
the terms of an agreement with EverBank Financial Corp., pricelinemortgage.com
allows consumers to access attractive financial services including, but not
limited to, mortgages, home equity loans, and banking service.  We record our proportionate share of the
results of pricelinemortgage.com as equity in income (loss) of investees and
minority interests.

Marketing
and Brand Awareness

Priceline.com has
established itself as one of the most recognized e-commerce brands through an
aggressive marketing and promotion campaign. 
During 2006, our total online and offline advertising expenses were
approximately $113.8 million and $31.8 million, respectively, a substantial
portion of which was spent in Europe.  We
intend to continue a marketing strategy to promote brand awareness and the
concept that consumers can save money on products and services while also
taking advantage of the “one-stop-shop” convenience afforded by our suite of
travel service offerings.  We advertise
primarily through television, radio and online marketing.  Underlying our marketing strategy is our belief
that our target market is all consumers, not just Internet-savvy
consumers.  We intend to continue to
promote the priceline.com and Booking.com brands aggressively throughout 2007.

As our European operations become more meaningful contributors to our
results, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in our
advertising expense.  Specifically,
because our European operations utilize online affiliate marketing and Internet
search engines, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, as
principal means of generating traffic to their websites, our online advertising
expense has increased significantly since our acquisition of those companies, a
trend we expect to continue throughout 2007.


Advertising Revenue

sell advertising to travel suppliers and others on our owned websites

Competition

We compete with both online and traditional sellers of the services we
offer. The market for the services we offer is intensely competitive, and
current and new competitors can launch new sites at a relatively low cost. In
addition, the major online travel companies with which we compete have
significantly greater financial resources and capital than we do.  We may not be able to effectively compete
with industry conglomerates such as Travelport, Sabre or Expedia, each of which
have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do.

We currently or potentially
compete with a variety of companies with respect to each service we offer. With
respect to our travel services, these competitors include:

·

Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, which are
owned by Expedia; Travelocity and lastminute.com, which are owned by the Sabre
Group; Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, Gullivers.com, ebookers plc, octopustravel and
Flairview, which are currently owned by Travelport, a subsidiary of the
Blackstone Group; laterooms and hotelopia owned by First Choice plc, and
Superbreak, Venere, hotel.de and Hotel Reservation Service;

·

travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and rental car
companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive
business;

·

large online portal and search companies, such as AOL (including AOL
Travel), Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Google;

·

traditional travel agencies;

·

online travel search sites such as SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com,
FareChase.com, Kayak.com (sometimes referred to as “meta-search”) and travel
research sites that have search functionality, such as TripAdvisor, Travelzoo
and Cheapflights.com; and

·

operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo,
Worldspan, L.P., Amadeus and Sabre.

Many airline, hotel and
rental car suppliers, including suppliers with which we conduct business, are
focusing on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book
airline reservations through an online channel other than their own
website.  Furthermore, many low cost
airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute
their inventory exclusively through their own websites.  Suppliers who sell on their own websites
typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances, offer
advantages such as bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings
more attractive to consumers than models like ours.

We potentially face
competition from a number of large Internet companies and services that have
expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic,
including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, which compete with us
either directly or indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or
off-line companies.  We also compete with
“meta-search” companies, which are companies that leverage their search
technology to aggregate travel search results across supplier, travel agent and
other websites.  For example, Yahoo! owns
FareChase.com, a travel


search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates
at travel supplier and third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites,
and AOL is party to a marketing and technology agreement, and holds a minority
interest in, Kayak.com, another leading meta-search company.  Other established search engine companies as
well as start-ups are attempting to enter the online travel marketplace in this
manner.  If Yahoo!, Google or other
portals decide to refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could
result in more competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition
costs for third-party sites such as ours. 
Competition from these and other sources could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many of our current and
potential competitors, including Internet directories, search engines and large
traditional retailers, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing,
personnel, technical and other resources than priceline.com. Some of these
competitors may be able to secure products and services on more favorable terms
than we can. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote
significantly greater resources to:

·

marketing and promotional campaigns;

·

attracting traffic to their websites;

·

attracting and retaining key employees;

·

securing vendors and inventory; and

·

website and systems development.

Increased competition could result in reduced operating margins, loss
of market share and damage to our brand. There can be no assurance that we will
be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. See “

Risk Factors — Intense competition could reduce our market share and
harm our financial performance

.”

Operations and Technology

Our domestic business is supported by a systems
platform, which was designed with an emphasis on scalability, performance and
reliability.  Our core demand collection
and offer processing systems are proprietary to priceline.com.  The software platform and architecture are
built on server-side Java, C++, ASP, & Perl, and SQL scripts integrated
with Oracle & MYSQL relational database systems.  This internal platform was designed to
include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to
vendors in the industries in which we operate. 
These include large global inventory systems, such as airline and hotel
room reservation systems and financial service providers, as well as individual
inventory suppliers, such as individual hotels. 
Our Internet servers utilize digital certificates to help us conduct
secure communications and transactions, as appropriate.

We out-source most
of our domestic call center and customer service functions, and use a real-time
interactive voice response system with transfer capabilities to our call
centers and customer service centers.

Our systems
infrastructure and web and database servers in the U.S. are hosted at SAVVIS in
Jersey City, New Jersey, which provides communication links, as well as 24-hour
monitoring and engineering support. 
SAVVIS has its own generator and multiple back-up systems in Jersey
City.  Substantial amounts of our
computer hardware for operating our services are also located at SAVVIS in
Jersey City.  We also maintain a second
web hosting facility at AT&T in New York City. Our network


operations center
monitors both web hosting facilities and is located in our Norwalk, Connecticut
headquarters.  All three facilities have
an uninterruptible power supply system, generators and redundant servers.  If SAVVIS were unable, for any reason, to
support our primary web hosting facility, we would need to activate our
secondary site at AT&T.

The systems
infrastructure and web and database servers of our European operations are
hosted at IX EUROPE, in London, England, and TrueServer BV and Redbus
Interhouse Netherlands, in the Netherlands.

Intellectual

We currently hold
fifteen issued United States patents, Nos. 5,794,207; 5,897,620; 6,085,169;
6,108,639; 6,134,534; 6,240,396; 6,332,129; 6,345,090; 6,356,878; 6,418,415;
6,466,919; 6,484,153; 6,510,418; 6,553,346; 6,993,503 and over twenty pending
United States and foreign patent applications. 
All of our issued United States patents expire between September 4, 2016
and April 28, 2020.  We file additional
patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate.

While we believe
that our issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our
business, there can be no assurance that:

·

a
third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us
from practicing features of our business or that will require us to pay for a
license to use those features;

·

our
operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties;

·

any
patent can be successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

·

the
pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

·

competitors
or potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of
competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;

·

because
of variations in the application of our business model to each of our services,
our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties from
utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more
categories; or

·

new
prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate
an issued patent.

There has been discussion
in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so-called “business
method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has
indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such
patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to have a direct

effect on patents
already granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, the new review
process will have on our pending patent applications. See, “

We aggressively monitor,
protect and enforce our copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade dress,
domain names and trade secrets on an ongoing basis through a combination of
laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements.  For example, we endeavor to register our
trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally,
currently holding over four hundred service mark registrations worldwide.  However, effective trademark, service mark,
copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
which our services are or may be made available online, regardless of our
continuous efforts to police and register our marks.  See, “

We currently own
numerous Internet domains in the United States and abroad.  Domain names are generally regulated by
Internet regulatory bodies such as the World Intellectual Property
Organization.  The relationship between
trademark and unfair competition laws and domain name registration is
evolving.  The Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act in the U.S. and the Uniform Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
have both significantly enhanced the ability to deter the infringing
incorporation of trademarks into domain names by third parties and to assert
our registrations against them.  We
actively pursue significant infringers as appropriate, including cybersquatters
and typosquatters who misappropriate our service marks and misspellings thereof
as domain names, in order to maintain our famous marks and prevent the dilution
of their distinctiveness.  See, “

Risk

Factors

.”

Governmental
Regulation

The services we provide
are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. For example, our
travel service is subject to laws governing the offer and/or sale of travel
services as well as laws requiring us to register as a “seller of travel.”  In addition, our services may be subject to
various state and local taxing regulations. 
See “

Risk Factors

—

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes

”.

In addition, our business is indirectly affected by
regulatory and legal uncertainties affecting travel suppliers and global
distribution systems.  In 2004, the
Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) published a Final Rule, abolishing the
rules governing global distribution systems. 
As a part of the Final Rule, the DOT rejected proposals to regulate
online travel service providers’ fare displays. 
However, the DOT deferred consideration of a proposal to amend its
policies regarding advertising of air tickets, to require that agency service
fees be stated separately from the price being charged by the airlines.  Our current service fee disclosure practices
differ from those proposed by the DOT. 
If the DOT were to resume consideration of and adopt the service fee
proposal, we may have less flexibility regarding merchandising air travel on
our websites.

We are subject to federal, state and international laws that require
protection of user privacy and user data.  In our processing of travel
transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable
data, both in the United States and Europe. 
This data is increasingly subject to legislation and


regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including the
Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection Directive and
variations of that directive in the member states of the European Union.  Such government action is typically intended
to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed and
transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.

Pricelinemortgage.com is
subject to laws governing the licensing and conduct of persons providing
mortgage brokerage services. Such laws typically require certain consumer
protection disclosures and loan solicitation procedures. For example, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits the payment and receipt of mortgage
loan referral fees, and permits persons to be compensated only for the fair
market value of non-referral services. Accordingly, pricelinemortgage.com’s
home financing service provides non-referral services such as website
development and advertising to a licensed mortgage broker who, in turn, provides
the back-end processing for loan referrals.

All of our services are
subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations
prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices.

We
are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses conducting online
commerce.  Presently, there are
relatively few laws specifically directed toward online services. However, due
to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and online services, it is
possible that laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the Internet
or online services. These laws and regulations could cover issues such as
online contracts, user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, fraud, content
and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property
rights and information security. Applicability to the Internet of existing laws
governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual
property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is developing,
but any such new legislation could have significant implications on how we
conduct online business. In addition, some states may require us to qualify in
that state to do business as a foreign corporation because our service is
available in that state over the Internet. Although we are qualified to do
business in a number of states, failure to meet the qualifications of certain
states, or a determination that we are required to qualify in additional
states, could subject us to taxes and penalties.  See “

Risk

Factors — Regulatory and legal uncertainties

Our
European operations are subject to various foreign regulations and governing
bodies that might limit their products and services. They may be affected by
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade
barriers in connection with online commerce. Any failure by our European
operations to comply may have an adverse effect on our business.

Seasonality

Prior
to introducing a retail travel option to our customers, substantially all of
our business was conducted under the

Name Your Own Price

®

system and accordingly, because those services
are non-refundable in nature, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking
was generated.  However, we recognize
revenue generated from our retail hotel services, including our European
operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a result, a meaningful amount of retail
hotel bookings generated earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve
their spring and summer vacations, will not be recognized until future
quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we expense the substantial majority
of our advertising activities as they are incurred, which is typically in the
quarter in which bookings are generated. 
Therefore, as our retail hotel business continues to grow, we expect our
quarterly results to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factors.


Employees

As of February 15, 2007, we
employed approximately 696 full-time employees, of which 274 are based at our
Norwalk, Connecticut headquarters. We also retain independent contractors to
support our customer service and system support functions.

We
have never had a work stoppage and our employees are not represented by any
collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees to be
good. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to
attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also
impair our business operations.  If any
of the following risks occur, our business, financial

condition, operating results
and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

Our European operations’ business model exposes us to certain risks
that we have not traditionally experienced in the hotel business.

Our European operations
distribute hotel rooms primarily through a retail model, whereby the customer
secures a reservation by providing credit card details, but we are not
compensated by the hotel property until such customer checks out of the hotel
property.  This requires our European operations
to pursue collection of commissions relating to hotel room reservations from
the hotel properties after the customer has completed his or her stay.  We do not have extensive experience in
collecting commissions from hotel properties and failure to sustain an adequate
collection rate could negatively impact the business of our European
operations.

Throughout 2006, our European operations grew
their gross bookings in excess of 100% on an annualized basis.  This growth rate has contributed
significantly to our growth in revenue, gross profit and earnings per
share.  We expect our European operations
to experience a significant decline in their growth rate in future years
because of the sheer size of their business (i.e., annualized growth rates are
expected to decline as performance is compared to stronger full-year 2006
results) and the competitiveness of the market. 
The expected decline in our European operations’ growth rate could have
a resulting negative impact on our future revenue and earnings per share growth
rates.

In addition, our European
operations rely heavily on various third parties to distribute hotel room
reservations, and our European operations’ distribution channels are
concentrated among a number of third parties. 
Should one or more of such third parties cease distribution of our
European operations’ reservations, or suffer deterioration in its search engine
ranking, due to changes in search engine algorithms or otherwise, the business
of our European operations could be negatively affected.  Similarly, a significant amount of our
European business is directed to our own websites through participation in
pay-per-click advertising campaigns on Internet search engines whose pricing
and operating dynamics can experience rapid change both technically and
competitively.  We have experienced
increased competition and increased costs associated with our advertising
campaigns.  If a major search engine
changes its pricing, operating or competitive dynamics in a negative manner,
our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely
affected.


The strategy of our
European operations involves rapid expansion into other European countries,
many of which have different customs, different levels of customer acceptance
of the Internet and different legislation, regulatory environments and tax
schemes.  Compliance with foreign legal,
regulatory or tax requirements will place demands on our time and resources,
and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal,
regulatory or tax consequences.  If our
European operations are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into other European
countries, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be
adversely affected.

We are dependent on the airline industry and certain airlines.

Our financial prospects are
significantly dependent upon our sale of leisure airline tickets.  Leisure travel, including the sale of leisure
airline tickets, is dependent on personal discretionary spending levels. As a
result, sales of leisure airline tickets and other leisure travel services tend
to decline during general economic downturns and recessions. In addition,
unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, political instability, regional
hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by
regulatory authorities, travel related accidents, travel related health
concerns and unusual weather patterns also may adversely affect the leisure
travel industry. As a result, our business also is likely to be affected by
those events. Further, work stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major
airlines could materially and adversely affect the airline industry and, as a
consequence, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

During the year ended
December 31, 2006, sales of airline tickets from our five largest and two
largest airline suppliers accounted for approximately 82.0% and 43.6% of total
airline tickets sold, respectively.  As a
result, we are currently substantially dependent upon the continued
participation of these airlines in priceline.com in order to maintain and
continue to grow our total gross profit.

Our arrangements with the
airlines that participate in our system — either

Name Your Own Price

®

or
price-disclosed service — generally do not require the airlines to provide any
specific quantity of airline tickets or to make tickets available for any
particular route or at any particular price. 
During the course of our business, we are in continuous dialogue with
our major airline suppliers about the nature and extent of their participation
in our system. The significant reduction on the part of any of our major
suppliers of their participation in our system for a sustained period of time
or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.  Moreover, the airline industry has
experienced a shift in market share from full-service carriers to low-cost
carriers that focus primarily on discount fares to leisure destinations and we
expect this trend to continue.  Some
low-cost carriers, such as Southwest and JetBlue, have not historically
distributed their tickets through us or other third-party intermediaries.  In addition, certain airlines have
significantly limited or eliminated sales of airline tickets through opaque
channels, preferring to consistently show the lowest available price on their
own website.  In addition, effective
January 1, 2007, Continental Airlines ceased participation in our airline
ticket service. If one or more participating airlines were to further limit or
eliminate discounting through opaque channels, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Due to our dependence on
the airline industry, we could be severely affected by changes in that
industry, and, in many cases, we will have no control over such changes or
their timing.  Several major U.S.
airlines are struggling financially and have either filed for reorganization
under the United States Bankruptcy Code or discussed publicly the risks of
bankruptcy.  Two of our largest airline
suppliers, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, are currently operating
under the protection of federal bankruptcy laws. If any of our suppliers currently
in bankruptcy liquidates or does not emerge from bankruptcy and we are unable
to replace such supplier as a participant in priceline.com, our business would
be adversely affected. In addition, in the event that another of our major
suppliers voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy and is subsequently
unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy,


and we are unable to replace such supplier, our
business would be adversely affected.  To
the extent other major U.S. airlines that participate in our system declare
bankruptcy, they may be unable or unwilling to honor tickets sold for their
flights. Our policy in such event would be to direct customers seeking a refund
or exchange to the airline, and not to provide a remedy ourselves. Because we
are the merchant-of-record on sales of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets to
our customers, however, we could experience a significant increase in demands
for refunds or credit card charge backs from customers, which could materially
and adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, because

Name Your Own Price

®

customers do not choose the airlines on which
they are to fly, the bankruptcy of a major U.S. airline or even the possibility
of a major U.S. airline declaring bankruptcy could discourage customers from
using our

Name Your Own Price

®

system to book airline tickets.

If one of our major airline
suppliers merges or consolidates with, or is acquired by, another company that
either does not participate in the priceline.com system or that participates on
substantially lower levels, the surviving company may elect not to participate
in our system or to participate at lower levels than the previous
supplier.  For example, in September
2005, US Airways and America West merged. 
US Airways was a meaningful participant in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system, but America West participated on a
very limited basis.  The resulting entity
participates in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system, but at much lower levels than US
Airways’ historical participation.  The
loss of any major airline participant in our

Name
Your Own Price

®

system could result
in other major airlines electing to terminate their participation in the

Name Your Own Price

®

system, which
would further negatively impact our business, results of operations and
financial condition.  In addition, fewer
independent suppliers reduces opacity and competition among suppliers.  In such event, if we are unable to divert sales
to other suppliers, our business, results of operations and financial condition
may be adversely affected.

In addition, given the
concentration of the airline industry, particularly in the domestic market, our
competitors could exert pressure on other airlines not to supply us with
tickets. Moreover, the airlines may attempt to establish their own buyer driven
commerce service or participate or invest in other similar services.

We are dependent on certain hotels.

Our financial prospects are
significantly dependent upon the facilitation of hotel room night reservations.  During the year ended December 31, 2006,

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights from our five largest hotel
suppliers accounted for approximately 34.2% of total

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room
nights sold.  As a result, we are
currently substantially dependent upon the continued participation of these
hotels in priceline.com’s hotel service in order to maintain and continue to
grow our total gross profit.

We currently have more than
40 national hotel chains participating in the

Name
Your Own Price

®

system.  However, our arrangements with the hotels
that participate in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system generally:

·

do not require the hotels to make available to our customers any specific
quantity of hotel rooms;

·

do not require the hotels to provide particular prices or levels of
discount; and

·

do not require the hotels to deal exclusively with us in the public sale of
discounted hotel rooms.


As a general matter, during
the course of our business, we are in continuous dialogue with our major hotel
suppliers about the nature and extent of their participation in our
system.  Improving economic conditions
are creating increased demand for hotel rooms and some hotels may reduce the
amount of inventory they sell through our service or increase the negotiated rates
at which they are willing to provide inventory. 
If hotel occupancy rates improve to the point that our hotel suppliers
no longer place the same value on our distribution systems, such suppliers may
reduce the amount of inventory they make available through priceline.com and/or
our European operations.  The significant
reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their participation in
our system for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.  Similarly, while
not dependent on certain hotel chains, the growth rates of our European
operations are dependent upon increasing levels of well-priced, demand-based
supply from their portfolio of hotel partners.

Many hotels use merchant
arrangements with companies like ours to dispose of excess hotel room inventory
at wholesale rates. If hotels experience increased demand for rooms, they might
reduce the amount of room inventory they make available through our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service.  The
recent improvement in occupancy rates discussed above could cause hotels to
reduce the amount of inventory they make available through our merchant price-disclosed
hotel service.

In addition, certain hotels
have begun initiatives to reduce margins received by third party intermediaries
on retail merchant transactions, which is the primary method we employ to
distribute retail hotel room reservations in the United States.  Many hotels distribute room inventory through
their own websites and therefore might increase negotiated rates for merchant
rate inventory sold through our merchant price-disclosed hotel service,
decreasing the margin available to us.  While
our merchant price-disclosed hotel agreements with our leading hotel suppliers
provide for specified discounts, if one or more participating hotels were to
require us to limit our merchant margins, upon contract renewal or otherwise,
it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our
financial performance

.

We compete with both online
and traditional sellers of the services we offer. The market for the services
we offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch
new sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, the major online travel
companies with which we compete have significantly greater financial resources
and capital than we do.  We may not be
able to effectively compete with industry conglomerates such as Travelport,
Sabre or Expedia, each of which have access to significantly greater and more
diversified resources than we do.

We currently or potentially
compete with a variety of companies with respect to each service we offer. With
respect to our travel services, these competitors include:

·

Internet travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, which are
owned by Expedia; Travelocity and lastminute.com, which are owned by the Sabre
Group; Orbitz.com, Cheaptickets, Gullivers.com, ebookers plc, octopustravel and
Flairview, which are currently owned by Travelport, a subsidiary of the
Blackstone Group, laterooms and hotelopia owned by First Choice plc, and
Superbreak, Venere, hotel.de and Hotel Reservation Service;

·

travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel companies and rental car
companies, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive
business;

·

large online portal and search companies, such as AOL (including AOL Travel),
Yahoo! (including Yahoo! Travel) and Google;


·

traditional travel agencies;

·

online travel search sites such as SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com,
FareChase.com, Kayak.com (sometimes referred to as “meta-search”) and travel
research sites that have search functionality, such as TripAdvisor, Travelzoo
and Cheapflights.com; and

·

operators of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo,
Worldspan, L.P., Amadeus and Sabre.

Many airline, hotel and
rental car suppliers, including suppliers with which we conduct business, are
focusing on driving online demand to their own websites in lieu of third-party
distributors such as us.  Certain
suppliers have attempted to charge additional fees to customers who book airline
reservations through an online channel other than their own website.  Furthermore, many low cost airlines, which
are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their inventory
exclusively through their own websites. 
Suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a
processing fee, and, in some instances, offer advantages such as bonus miles or
loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers
than models like ours.

We potentially face
competition from a number of large Internet companies and services that have
expertise in developing online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic,
including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, which compete with us
either directly or indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or
off-line companies.  We also compete with
“meta-search” companies, which are companies that leverage their search
technology to aggregate travel search results across supplier, travel agent and
other websites.  For example, Yahoo! owns
FareChase.com, a travel search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates
at travel supplier and third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites,
and AOL is party to a marketing and technology agreement, and holds a minority
interest in, Kayak.com, another leading meta-search company.  Other established search engine companies as
well as start-ups are attempting to enter the online travel marketplace in this
manner.  If Yahoo!, Google or other
portals decide to refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could
result in more competition from supplier websites and higher customer
acquisition costs for third-party sites such as ours.  Competition from these and other sources
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Many of our current and
potential competitors, including Internet directories, search engines and large
traditional retailers, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases,
greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing,
personnel, technical and other resources than priceline.com. Some of these
competitors may be able to secure products and services on more favorable terms
than we can. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to devote significantly
greater resources to:

·

marketing and promotional campaigns;

·

attracting traffic to their websites;

·

attracting and retaining key employees;

·

securing vendors and inventory; and

·

website and systems development.

Increased competition could
result in reduced operating margins, loss of market share and damage to our
brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully
against


current and
future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our outstanding
convertible senior notes could result in substantial shareholder dilution.

Our convertible senior
notes are convertible into shares of our common stock if certain specified
conditions are met.  Upon conversion, the
holder will receive cash for the principal amount of the note and cash or
shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common
stock for the conversion value in excess of such principal amount.   If our stock trades above the conversion
prices of the outstanding convertible notes, our diluted share count will
increase by the net number of shares that would become issuable to the holders
of our outstanding convertible notes and, as a consequence, have a dilutive
impact on net income per share.  As an example, at stock prices of $40 per
share, $60 per share and $100 per share, our diluted share count would include
approximately 0.1 million, 4.8 million and 8.6 million equivalent shares,
respectively, related to the conversion premium on our convertible debt
(excluding the offsetting impact of the Conversion Spread Hedges).  We issued

Conversion Spread Hedges that increase the
effective conversion price of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes from $40.38 to $50.47
per share, and reduce the dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the
2013 Notes.  Since the impact of the
Conversion Spread Hedges is anti-dilutive it is excluded from the calculation
of net income per share under GAAP until they are exercised upon maturity.

Our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine
algorithms and dynamics.

We utilize Internet search
engines, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords, to
generate traffic to our websites.  Our
European operations, in particular, rely to a significant extent upon
third-party distribution partners that derive substantial business from search
engines.  Search engines frequently
update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of results
of a user’s search, such that the placement of links to our sites, and
particularly those of our European operations and their affiliates, can be
negatively affected.  In a similar way, a
significant amount of our European business is directed to our own websites
through participation in pay-per-click advertising campaigns on Internet search
engines whose pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change
commercially, technically and competitively. 
If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that further
negatively affects the search engine ranking of our brands or our third-party
distribution partners or changes its pricing, operating or competitive dynamics
in a negative manner, our business, results of operations and financial
condition would be adversely affected.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

As a result of our
acquisitions of our European operations, we are conducting a significant and
growing portion of our business outside the United States and are reporting our
results in U.S. dollars.  As a result, we
face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates.  The results of operations of our European
operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial
results of our European operations are translated from local currency into U.S.
dollars upon consolidation.  If the U.S.
dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net
revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss.  Similarly, our net assets, net revenues,
operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar
strengthens against local currency. Additionally, transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency may result in gains and losses that may
adversely impact our results of operations.


We may lose or be subject to reduction of
global distribution system fees.

We rely on fees paid to us by
Worldspan, L.P. and other global distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel
bookings made through GDSs for a portion of our gross profit and a substantial
portion of our operating income. We rebate certain GDS costs to certain
suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels, etc.) in exchange for contractual
considerations such as those relating to pricing and availability, and expect
to continue to do so in the future. 
During 2006, most agreements between GDSs and the major domestic
airlines expired, and most airlines have negotiated new agreements with reduced
distribution costs for the airlines that went into effect September 1,
2006.  The structure of these new
agreements, along with airline pressure on us to operate under the new structures,
require us to reduce our aggregate compensation and book through lower cost
channels to receive airlines’ full content and avoid airline service fees.  We have entered into new agreements with a
number of airlines to obtain access to airline content, and are in continuing
discussions with others to obtain similar access.  If we were denied access to airlines’ full
content or had to impose service fees on our airline tickets, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Additionally, some travel
suppliers are encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to
develop technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct
connections to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution
methods recently developed by new entrants to the global distribution
marketplace, such as G2 Switchworks Corp. 
Such new entrants propose using technology that is less complex than
traditional global distribution systems, and that enables the distribution of
airline tickets in a manner that is more cost-effective to the airline
suppliers.  To this end, in the first
quarter 2006, we entered into an agreement with G2 Switchworks for the
provision of GDS services.  In addition,
to further reduce our dependence on Worldspan, L.P., in the first quarter 2006,
we entered into an agreement for the provision of GDS services with Sabre
Inc.  Development of the technology to
connect to such alternative GDSs, or to enable direct connections to travel
suppliers, requires the use of information technology resources and could cause
us to incur additional operating expenses, increase the frequency/duration of
system problems and delay other projects. 
Furthermore, our contractual obligations to Worldspan, L.P. may limit
our ability to pursue the most financially attractive GDS options during the
term of our agreement with Worldspan, L.P., which expires on December 31, 2007.

We recently began utilizing
the services of both G2 Switchworks and Sabre Inc. to search for and book some
of the airline tickets we make available to consumers.  We believe that this arrangement provides us
with the opportunity to access favorable GDS economics with respect to a
certain portion of our airline ticket business. 
As discussed above, G2 Switchworks is a new entrant to the GDS
marketplace and receives its search technology from ITA Software, a third
party.  If our access to G2 Switchworks
search services becomes limited or unavailable due to technical problems on the
part of G2 Switchworks, issues between G2 Switchworks and ITA, or any other
reason beyond our control, we would not be able to utilize our most efficient
channel for those airline ticket bookings, and our business, results of
operations and financial condition could suffer.

Our ability to satisfy customers may be adversely affected by a number
of factors outside our control.

Most of our revenue is
derived from the leisure travel industry, and is, therefore, subject to
increase and decrease with the level of activity in the leisure travel
industry, a factor almost entirely out of our control.  The travel industry is seasonal and our
revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter. Factors that may
adversely affect leisure travel activity include, without limitation,  economic downturns and recessions; global
security issues, political instability, acts of terrorism, civil unrest,
hostilities and war; increased fuel costs; increased airport security that
could reduce the convenience of air travel; inclement weather or natural
disaster such as hurricane, tsunami or earthquake; increased occurrence of,


or widely publicized travel-related accidents; the
outbreak of an epidemic or pandemic such as SARS or avian bird flu; and the
financial condition of travel suppliers.

If we lose our key personnel or cannot recruit additional personnel,
our business may suffer.

We depend on the continued
services and performance of our executive officers and other key personnel,
both in the United States and Europe. These individuals have acquired
specialized knowledge and skills with respect to priceline.com and our domestic
and European operations. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies.
Our ability to retain key employees could be materially adversely affected by
the decline in the market price of our common stock, limitations on our ability
to pay cash compensation that is equivalent to cash paid by traditional
businesses or, in some instances, larger or better capitalized competitors, and
limitations imposed by our employee benefit plans on our ability to issue
additional equity incentives. If we do not succeed in attracting new employees
or retaining and motivating current and future employees or executive officers,
our business could suffer significantly.

Defending against intellectual property claims could be expensive and
disruptive to our business.

From time to time, in the
ordinary course of our business, we have been subject to, and are currently
subject to, legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property
rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert
intellectual property claims, in particular patent claims, against us,
particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business.  We endeavor to defend our intellectual
property rights diligently, but intellectual property litigation is extremely
expensive and time consuming, and has and is likely to continue to divert
managerial attention and resources from our business objectives.  Successful infringement claims against us
could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our
business, or portions of our business. 
In addition, resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to
use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties, which may be
expensive to procure, or possibly to cease using those rights altogether.  Any of these events could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties.

As part of our business
strategy, in September 2004, we acquired Booking.com Limited (formerly known as
Active Hotels Ltd.) and, in July 2005, Booking.com B.V. (formerly known as
Bookings.com B.V.).  We may enter into
additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future.  Acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances
of equity securities, use of our cash resources, incurrence of debt and
amortization of expenses related to intangible assets acquired.  In addition, the process of integrating an
acquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen operating
difficulties and expenditures.  The
acquisitions of

Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited were accompanied
by a number of risks, including, without limitation:

·

the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies
appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the
acquisitions may have lacked such controls, procedures and policies;

·

the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of

Booking.com
Limited and Booking.com B.V., which are
principally located in Cambridge, England, and Amsterdam, The Netherlands,
respectively, with and into our operations, which are headquartered in Norwalk,
Connecticut;

·

the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of
management;


·

the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our
services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;

·

the failure to further successfully develop acquired technology resulting
in the impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;

·

the impairment of relationships with customers of

Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited or our own
customers as a result of any integration of operations;

·

the impairment of relationships with employees of

Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited or our own
business as a result of any integration of new management personnel;

·

the potential unknown liabilities associated with

Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited.

We may experience similar
risks in connection with any future acquisitions. We may not be successful in
addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the
acquisitions of

Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited or that we could
encounter in future acquisitions, which would harm our business or cause us to
fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.  As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
$334 million assigned primarily to the intangible assets and goodwill of Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited, and therefore,
the occurrence of any of the aforementioned risks could result in a material
adverse impact, including a material impairment of these assets, which could
cause us to have to write-down goodwill. 
Any such write-down of goodwill could adversely impact our operating
results, which would cause our stock price to decline significantly.

Our growth cannot be assured. Even if we do experience growth, we
cannot assure you that we will grow profitably.

Our business strategies are
dependent on the growth of our business. For us to achieve significant growth,
consumers and travel suppliers must continue to accept our website as a
valuable commercial tool. Consumers who have historically purchased travel
services using traditional commercial channels, such as local travel agents and
calling suppliers directly, must instead purchase these services on our
website. Similarly, travel suppliers will also need to accept or expand their
use of our website and view our website as an efficient and profitable channel of
distribution for their travel products. Our ability to enhance awareness of the
priceline.com brands and offer services that will attract and retain a
significant number of new consumers and travel suppliers is not certain, and
therefore, our growth may be limited.

We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other
changes.

The markets in which we
compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry
standards, consolidation, frequent new service and product announcements,
introductions and enhancements and changing consumer demands. We may not be
able to keep up with these rapid changes. In addition, these market
characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the Internet and the
apparent need of companies from many industries to offer Internet based
products and services. As a result, our future success will depend on our
ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our services to
evolving industry standards and to continually improve the performance,
features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and
product offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace. In addition, the
widespread adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications
technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur
substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure.


External or internal security breaches could harm our business.

The secure transmission of
confidential information over the Internet is essential in maintaining consumer
and supplier confidence in the priceline.com services. Substantial or ongoing
security breaches whether instigated internally or externally on our system or
other Internet based systems could significantly harm our business. We
currently require customers who use certain of our services to guarantee their
offers with their credit card, either online or, in some instances, through our
toll-free telephone service. It is possible that advances in computer
circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result
in a compromise or breach of customer transaction data.

We incur substantial
expense to protect against and remedy security breaches and their consequences.
However, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security
breaches. A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third
party) that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal customer
information or transaction data, proprietary information or cause significant
interruptions in our operations. For instance, several major websites have
experienced significant interruptions as a result of improper direction of
excess traffic to those sites, and computer viruses have substantially
disrupted e-mail and other functionality in a number of countries, including
the United States. Security breaches also could damage our reputation and
expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Security
breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence
in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our
brand.  Our insurance policies carry low
coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by
security breaches.

Companies that we have
acquired, such as our European operations, and that we may acquire in the
future, may employ security and networking standards at levels we find
unsatisfactory.  The process of enhancing
infrastructure to attain improved security and network standards may be time
consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are
difficult to obtain.  Such acquisitions
increase the number of potential vulnerabilities, and can cause delays in detection
of an attack, as well as the timelines of recovery from any given attack.
Failure to raise any such standards that we find unsatisfactory could expose us
to security breaches that would have an adverse impact on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

We also face risks
associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business
over the Internet. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy
on the Internet, and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth
of the Internet and, therefore, the priceline.com service as a means of
conducting commercial transactions. 
Additionally, security breaches at the third-party, supplier or
distributor systems upon which we rely could result in negative publicity.

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give
rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal
requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.

In our processing of travel
transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable
data.  This data is increasingly subject
to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world,
including the Commission of the European Union through its Data Protection
Directive and variations of that directive in the member states of the European
Union.  This government action is
typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected,
processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.  We could be adversely affected if legislation
or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations
in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.


In addition, in the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States,
government agencies have been contemplating or developing initiatives to
enhance national and aviation security, including the Transportation Security
Administration’s Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System, known as
CAPPS II.  These initiatives may result
in conflicting legal requirements with respect to data handling.  As privacy and data protection has become a
more sensitive issue, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a
result of differing views on the privacy of travel data.  Travel businesses have also been subjected to
investigations, lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper
disclosure of passenger information. 
These and other privacy developments that are difficult to anticipate
could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We rely on the value of the priceline.com and Booking.com brands, and
the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.

We believe that maintaining
and expanding the priceline.com brand, and other owned brands, including
Lowestfare.com, Rentalcars.com, Breezenet.com, MyTravelGuide.com, Travelweb,

Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, are important aspects of our efforts to attract and
expand our user and advertiser base.  As
our larger competitors spend increasingly more on advertising, we are required
to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition.  Promotion of the priceline.com brand will
depend largely on our success in satisfying our customers. In addition, we have
spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and
maintenance of the priceline.com brands, and we will continue to spend money
on, and devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building
efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the priceline.com brands.
We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of
the priceline.com brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding
efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain
or enhance customer awareness of the priceline.com brands in a cost-effective
manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be
adversely affected.

We may be
unable to generate sufficient cash to repay or repurchase our $570 million
Convertible Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2006, we have $570 million of Convertible Senior
Notes outstanding comprised of 2006 1% Notes with an aggregate principal amount
of $125 million, 2006 2.25% Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $100
million, 2011 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million and
2013 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $172.5 million (collectively,
the “Notes”).  The holders of the 2006 1%
Notes may require us to repurchase the notes on August 1, 2008, the holders of
the 2006 2.25% Notes may require us to repurchase the notes on January 15,
2010, 2015 or 2020, and the holders of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes may
require us to repurchase the notes upon certain designated events.  The
Notes also become convertible if certain specified conditions are met,
including if our stock price exceeds contingent conversion levels for a
specified period.  Subsequent to December
31, 2006, the closing price of our common stock has exceeded the contingent
conversion prices for our notes. 
 If the closing price exceeds the contingent conversion prices for
20 days in the specified conversion periods some or all of the convertible
notes would become convertible at the holder’s option requiring us to classify
the related outstanding debt balance as a current liability in our consolidated
balance sheet.  We believe it is highly
unlikely that a significant portion of the Notes would be converted prior to
maturity because the market value of the Notes exceeds the value that holders
of the Notes would receive upon conversion.  However, if holders elect to
convert, we would be required to settle the principal amount of the Notes in
cash and the conversion premium in cash or shares of common stock.  We would likely fund the repayment with
existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, common stock
issuances and/or additional borrowings. It is possible that we may not have
sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing which
would cause us to be in default under our indentures and our business, results
of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.


Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual
property.

We regard our intellectual
property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and
patent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license
agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our
proprietary rights. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual
property, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

While we believe that our
issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business,
there can be no assurance that:

·

any patent can be successfully defended against challenges by third
parties;

·

pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

·

competitors or potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new
methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent
applications;

·

because of variations in the application of our business model to each of
our services, our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third
parties from utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in
one or more categories;

·

new prior art will not be discovered which may diminish the value of or
invalidate an issued patent;

·

a third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that prevent us
from practicing features of our business or require us to pay for a license to
use those features; or

·

our operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of
third parties.

There has been recent
discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called “business
method” patents. As a result, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has
indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such
patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to have a direct
effect on patents already granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if any,
the new review process will have on our pending patent applications.

We pursue the registration
of our trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. However,
effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may
not be available in every country in which our services are made available
online. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future,
certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material,
to third parties. These licensees may take actions that might diminish the
value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.

Our business is dependent upon third party systems and service
providers.

We rely on certain third
party computer systems and third party service providers, including the
computerized central reservation systems of the airline, hotel and rental car
industries to satisfy demand for airline tickets, hotel room and rental car
reservations. In particular, our travel business is substantially dependent
upon the computerized reservation systems of operators of global distribution
systems for the travel industry. Any interruption in these third party services
systems or deterioration in their performance


could prevent us from booking airline, hotel and
rental car reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Our
agreements with some third party service providers are terminable upon short
notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions. In the
event our arrangement with any of such third parties is terminated, we may not
be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or
on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

A substantial portion of
our computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at the
facilities of SAVVIS in New Jersey, AT&T in New York City, IX EUROPE in
London, England, TrueServer BV and Redbus Interhouse in the Netherlands.  If SAVVIS is, for any reason, unable to
support our website, we would need to quickly complete the activation of our
secondary site at the AT&T web hosting facility.  Any of these conditions could cause
disruptions to our business or exposure to potentially damaging press coverage
of the problems, and would have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Our communications
infrastructure and, in some cases, the electrical power supply for our
production systems, is provided by vendors such as AT&T, Verizon, IX
EUROPE, Verizon Business B.V., TrueServer BV and MCI.  If they are unable, for any reason, to
support the communications infrastructure and electrical power they provide us,
instabilities in our systems could increase until such time as we were able to
replace their services.

While we do maintain
redundant systems and hosting services for some of our business, it is possible
that we could experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry
business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may
occur.

Capacity constraints and system failures could harm our business.

We rely on supplier and
distribution systems, including those of Worldspan, L.P., Pegasus Solutions,
Sabre Inc., G2 Switchworks Corp., ITA and Navitaire.  If any of these systems becomes inaccessible,
or partially inaccessible to us, due to system failure or otherwise, for any
significant amount of time, our ability to process reservations could be
adversely affected, in which case our results would suffer.  We also depend upon Paymentech to process our
credit card transactions. If Paymentech was wholly or partially compromised,
our cash flows could be disrupted until such a time as a replacement process
could be put in place with a different vendor. 
As we add complexity to our systems infrastructure by adding new
supplier and distribution, our total system availability could decline and our
results could suffer.

A substantial amount of our
computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at the
facilities of SAVVIS in New Jersey, AT&T in New York City, IX EUROPE in
London, England, TrueServer BV and Redbus Interhouse in the Netherlands. These
systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human
error, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures and similar
events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of
vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite any precautions we may take, the
occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the SAVVIS
facility, the AT&T facility, the IX EUROPE facility or the Redbus
Interhouse facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In
addition, the failure by SAVVIS, Verizon, AT&T, IX EUROPE, Verizon Business
B.V. or TrueServer BV to provide our required data communications capacity
could result in interruptions in our service. Any system failure that causes an
interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of the priceline.com
service could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


If our systems cannot be
expanded to cope with increased demand or fails to perform, we could
experience:

·

unanticipated disruptions in service;

·

slower response times;

·

decreased customer service and customer satisfaction; or

·

delays in the introduction of new products and services,

any of which could impair our reputation, damage the
priceline.com brand and materially and adversely affect our revenues. Publicity
about a service disruption also could cause a material decline in our stock
price.

Like many online
businesses, we have experienced system failures from time to time. For example,
in May 2001, our primary website was interrupted for a period of 12 hours. In
addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff, these outages
create a significant amount of user questions and complaints that need to be
addressed by our customer support personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in
our service could result in an immediate loss of revenues that can be
substantial and may cause some users to switch to our competitors. If we
experience frequent or persistent system failures, our reputation and brand could
be permanently harmed. We have been taking steps to increase the reliability
and redundancy of our system. These steps are expensive, may reduce our margins
and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled
downtime.

We use both internally
developed systems and third-party systems to operate the priceline.com service,
including transaction processing, order management and financial systems that
were designed to be scaleable and stable. However, if the number of users of our
services increases substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop
operating as designed, we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our
technology, transaction processing systems, financial systems and other
infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to upgrade our systems
and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner.

Companies that we have
acquired, such as our European operations, and that we may acquire in the
future, may present known or unknown capacity/stability or other types of
system challenges.  The process of
enhancing infrastructure to attain improved capacity/scalability and other
system characteristics may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources
and expertise that are difficult to obtain. 
Such acquisitions increase potential downtime, customer facing problems
and compliance problems.  Failure to
successfully make any such improvements to such infrastructures could expose us
to potential capacity, stability, and system problems that would have an
adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We recently integrated our
entire European hotel offerings into a single back-office extranet system
operated by Booking.com B.V., in order to allow customers of both Booking.com
B.V. and Booking.com Limited to access hotels which may have previously been
available only through either Booking.com B.V. or Booking.com Limited.  Because all of our European operations’ hotel
offerings are therefore on one platform, in the event that the extranet
operated by Booking.com B.V. experiences a system failure, our European
operations could be unable to generate hotel bookings, which would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, in the second quarter of 2006,
we started to implement a new financial accounting system at Booking.com B.V.,
which is expected to improve efficiency and support growth.  The financial accounting system is new to


us, however, and could
present unforeseen technical or other issues, including without limitation,
systems failures, any of which would place further demands on our European
technology and business resources and could adversely impact our European
operations.

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes.

We file tax returns in such
states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional
businesses. In addition, we pay sales and other taxes, including hotel
occupancy taxes, to suppliers related to travel services sold through the
priceline.com service.  We believe that
this practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions. On an
ongoing basis, we conduct a review and interpretation of the tax laws in
various states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and
local hotel occupancy and other related taxes. 
In connection with our review, we have met and had discussions with
taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in any
particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel
occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts
collected by the hotels. Consistent with this practice, we recover the taxes on
the underlying cost of the hotel room night from customers and pay that amount
to the hotel operators for payment to the appropriate tax authorities.  As discussed in Note 19 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have initiated lawsuits indicating
the position that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the
differential between the price paid by a customer utilizing our service and the
cost of the underlying room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this
differential. Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are
subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek
to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively or both. A number
of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose
additional taxes on the sale of products and services through the Internet or
the income derived from these sales. Such actions may result in substantial tax
liabilities for past and/or future sales and could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent that any tax
authority succeeds in asserting that any such tax collection responsibility
exists, it is likely that, with respect to future transactions, we would
collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which would have
the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room nights to our customers and,
consequently, could reduce our hotel sales. We will continue to assess the
risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the
extent appropriate, we will reserve for those estimated liabilities.

Current economic conditions
in the United States are triggering active consideration on ways to generate
additional tax revenues by the federal, state and local governments. We cannot
predict what changes in tax law or interpretations of such laws may be adopted
or assure that such changes or interpretations would not materially impact our
business.

Our business is exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud and
charge backs.

To date, our results have
been negatively impacted by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards.
Because we act as the merchant-of-record in a majority of our transactions, we
may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well
as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are held liable
for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do
not act as merchant of record. 
Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting
credit card charge backs.  If we are
unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our website, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.


Fluctuations in our financial results make
quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting difficult.

Our revenues and operating results
have varied significantly from quarter to quarter because our business
experiences seasonal fluctuations, which reflect seasonal trends for the travel
services offered by our websites. Traditional leisure travel bookings in the
United States are higher in the second and third calendar quarters of the year
as consumers take spring and summer vacations. In the first and fourth quarters
of the calendar year, demand for travel services in the United States generally
declines and the number of bookings flattens. 
Travel revenues in Europe, on the other hand, have been higher in the
third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters.  Furthermore, prior to introducing a retail
travel option to our customers, substantially all of our business was conducted
under the

Name Your Own Price

®

system and accordingly, because those services
are non-refundable in nature, we recognize travel revenue at the time a booking
was generated.  We recognize revenue
generated from our retail hotel service, however, including our European
operations, at the time that the customer checks out of the hotel.  As a result, we have seen and expect to
continue to see, that a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated
earlier in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer
vacations, will not be recognized until future quarters.  This could result in a disproportionate
amount of our annual earnings being recognized in later quarters.

Our results may also be
affected by seasonal fluctuations in the inventory made available to us by
airlines, hotels and rental car suppliers. Our revenues and operating results
may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of these
factors. As a result, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues and
operating results may not be meaningful. In addition, due to our limited
operating history, a relatively new and unproven business model and an uncertain
environment in the travel industry, it may be difficult to predict our future
revenues or results of operations.

Because of these
fluctuations and uncertainties, our operating results may fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading
price of our common stock would almost certainly be materially adversely
affected.

Our financial results will be materially impacted by income taxes in
the future.

We commenced recording a
U.S. tax provision in the third quarter of 2005 upon recording the reversal of
a portion of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.  This non-cash provision will materially
negatively impact future net income and earnings per share as compared to prior
periods.  Due to our significant net
operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S.
federal taxable income tax for the foreseeable future.  We expect to make cash payments for U.S.
alternative minimum tax and for certain international taxes.

Our stock price is highly volatile.

The market price of our
common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are
beyond our control:

·

quarterly variations in our operating results;

·

operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts
and investors;

·

changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including
financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;


·

changes in our capital structure;

·

changes in market valuations of other Internet or online service companies;

·

announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our
competitors;

·

announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,
acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

·

loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or hotel chain;

·

changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

·

lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically;

·

announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against
us or adverse developments in pending proceedings;

·

additions or departures of key personnel; and

·

stock market price and volume fluctuations.

Sales of a substantial
number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of
our common stock by introducing a large number of sellers to the market. Given
the volatility that exists for our shares, such sales could cause the market
price of our common stock to decline significantly. In addition, fluctuations
in our stock price and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock
attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds
into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either
direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis.

The trading prices of
Internet company stocks in general, including ours, have experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations. To the extent that the public’s perception of
the prospects of Internet or e-commerce companies is negative, our stock price
could decline further, regardless of our results. Other broad market and
industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless
of our operating performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political
and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate
fluctuations, also may decrease the market price of our common stock.  Negative market conditions could adversely
affect our ability to raise additional capital.

We are defendants in a
number of securities class action litigations. In the past, securities class
action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. To the extent our stock price
declines or is volatile, we may in the future be the target of additional
litigation. This additional litigation could result in substantial costs and
divert management’s attention and resources.

We are party to legal proceedings which, if adversely decided, could
materially adversely affect us.

We are a party to the legal
proceedings described in Item 3 and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.  The defense of the actions
described in Item 3 and Note 19 may increase our


expenses and an adverse outcome in
any of such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business.

The products and services we offer
through the priceline.com service are regulated by federal and state
governments. Our ability to provide such products and services is and will
continue to be affected by such regulations. The implementation of unfavorable
regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or
regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause
the development of the affected markets to become impractical and otherwise
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.  See “

Uncertainty regarding state and local taxes.”

further expansion of corporate operations.

Item 3.  Legal
Proceedings

Litigation Related to Hotel Occupancy and Other Taxes

Statewide
Putative Class Actions

A number of cities and counties have filed putative class actions on
behalf of themselves and other allegedly similarly situated cities and counties
within the same respective state against the Company and other defendants,
including, but not in all cases, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC,
both of which are subsidiaries of the Company, and Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com
GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Travelport, Inc. (f/k/a Cendant
Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.); Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork
Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com); Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.;
Orbitz, LLC; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; and
Travelnow.com, Inc.  Each complaint
alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated each jurisdiction’s
respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charges and
remittance of amounts to cover taxes under each ordinance.  Each complaint typically seeks compensatory
damages, disgorgement, penalties available by law, attorneys’ fees and other
relief.  Such actions include:

City of Los Angeles v. Hotels.com, Inc., et al.

:  On
December 30, 2004, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior
Court for the County of Los Angeles by the City of Los Angeles on behalf of
itself and an alleged class of California cities, counties and other
municipalities that have enacted occupancy taxes.  In addition to the tax claims, the complaint
also asserts unfair competition


claims under California Business and Professions Code
§ 17200,

et seq.

(“Section 17200”).  On May 19, 2005, the court ordered limited
discovery.  On August 31, 2005, the City
of Los Angeles filed an amended complaint adding a claim for a declaratory
judgment.  On September 26, 2005, the
court sustained the defendants’ demurrers on grounds of improper joinder of
defendants and claims, and therefore, dismissed the amended complaint, with
leave to file a second amended complaint. 
On February 8, 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a second amended
complaint that asserts the same claims but includes additional allegations of
fact.  On March 27, 2006, at the
direction of the court, the defendants filed renewed demurrers to the second
amended complaint on grounds of improper joinder of defendants and claims.  Those demurrers have been fully briefed.  On March 31, 2006, the defendants filed a
petition to coordinate this matter with the

City of San Diego

case (discussed below).  On July 12,
2006, that petition was granted, and, as a result, this case and the

City of San Diego

case will now proceed in the Superior
Court of Los Angeles.  The City of Los
Angeles informed the court that it will submit on February 21, 2007 a proposed
further amended complaint. On March 1, 2007, the court is scheduled to conduct
oral argument on Defendants’ demurrers on grounds of improper joinder of
defendants and claims, and, if necessary, it will hear the parties’ positions
on whether and how to proceed with the City of Los Angeles’ proposed third
amended complaint.

City of Fairview Heights v. Orbitz, Inc., et al.

:  On
October 5, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Circuit

action to state court.  On July 12, 2006,
the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss all claims other than the tax
claim, denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the tax claim, and denied plaintiff’s
motion to remand.  The parties are
currently conducting discovery.

City of Findlay v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On
October 25, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Common
Pleas Court of Hancock County, Ohio by the City of Findlay on behalf of itself
and a putative class of Ohio cities, counties and townships that have enacted
occupancy or excise taxes on lodging.  In
addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for violation of
the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1345,

et seq

., conversion, a constructive trust and a declaratory
judgment.  On November 22, 2005, the
Company and certain other defendants removed this action to the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  On January 30, 2006, the defendants moved to
dismiss the complaint.  On July 26, 2006,
the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the Consumer Sales Practices
Act claims and denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the remaining claims.  The parties are currently conducting merits
discovery.

City of Rome, Georgia, et al., v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

November 18, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by the City of Rome,
Hart County and the City of Cartersville on behalf of themselves and a putative
class of Georgia cities, counties and governments which have enacted transient
occupancy taxes and/or excise taxes on lodging. 
In addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for
violation of Georgia’s Uniform Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,
conversion, unjust enrichment, a constructive trust and a declaratory
judgment.  On February 6, 2006, the
Company and certain other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On May 8, 2006, the court granted defendants’
motion to dismiss all claims relating to the Georgia sales and use tax and
denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the excise tax claims.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on
June 7, 2006 naming additional plaintiffs.

that impose occupancy taxes.  In addition
to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for violation of North
Carolina General Statute § 75-1,

et seq

.,
conversion, a constructive trust and a declaratory judgment.  On February 13, 2006, the defendants removed

:  On
May 8, 2006, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Texas, San Antonio Division, by the
City of San Antonio on behalf of itself and putative classes of Texas
municipalities.  In addition to the tax
claims, the complaint also asserts claim for conversion and a declaratory
judgment.  On June 30, 2006, the Company
and other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On August 28, 2006, the plaintiff moved for
class certification.  Following briefing
of the motion to dismiss and motion for class certification, on October 30,
2006, the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint that limited the putative
classes of Texas municipalities to 175 specifically enumerated municipalities
that plaintiff alleges to have hotel occupancy tax ordinances similar to that
of the plaintiff.  On November 2, 2006,
the court heard argument on the motion to dismiss and the parties are awaiting
a decision.  The court delayed
consideration of the motion for class certification pending briefing on the
class definition of the first amended complaint.  The parties are currently conducting
discovery.

City of Gallup, New Mexico v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On

Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendations, and the parties are currently
briefing those objections.  The
plaintiffs have also filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to strike
all class action allegations from the complaint.  That motion is being briefed.

Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government v. Hotels.com, L.P., et
al.

:  On September 21, 2006, a putative class
action was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Kentucky by the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government on behalf of
itself and a putative class of Kentucky cities, counties and townships that

reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

Actions
Filed on Behalf of Individual Cities

Several cities, counties, municipalities and other political
subdivisions across the country have filed actions relating to the collection
of hotel occupancy taxes against the Company and other defendants, including,
but not in all cases, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC, both of
which are subsidiaries of the Company, and Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com GP,
LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Cendant Travel Distribution Services
Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com);
Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; Site59.com, LLC;
Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; and Travelnow.com, Inc.  In each, the complaint alleges, among other
things, that each of these defendants violated each jurisdiction’s respective
hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charges and remittance of
amounts to cover taxes under each ordinance. 
Each complaint typically seeks compensatory damages, disgorgement,
penalties available by law, attorneys’ fees and other relief.  Such actions include:

City of Chicago, Illinois v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al

.:  On
November 1, 2005, the City of Chicago, Illinois filed a complaint in the
Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. 
In addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for
conversion, imposition of a constructive trust, and a demand for a legal
accounting.  On January 31, 2006, the
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. 
Oral argument on the motion to dismiss was held on January 16, 2007 and
the motion is under submission.

City of San Diego, California, v. Hotels.com L.P., et al.

:  On
February 9, 2006, the City of San Diego, California filed a complaint in Superior
Court for the County of San Diego, California. 
In addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts unfair
competition claims under Section 17200. 
On March 31, 2006, the defendants filed with a petition to coordinate
this matter with the

City of Los Angeles

case (discussed above).  On July 12,
2006, that petition was granted, and, as a result, this case was coordinated
with the

City of Los Angeles

action and will
proceed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles. 
Limited discovery has been provided to the City of San Diego consistent
with that provided to the City of Los Angeles. 
The City of San Diego informed the court that it will submit on February
21, 2007 a proposed further amended complaint. 
As discussed above, a hearing is set for March 1, 2007 on Defendants’
demurrers to the City of Los Angeles’ Second Amended Complaint on misjoinder
grounds, and, if necessary, the court will hear the parties’ positions on
whether and how to proceed with the City of San Diego’s proposed amended
complaint.  The City of San Diego,
represented by the same outside counsel as the City of Los Angeles, has
represented to the court that if the court sustains the pending demurrers in
the

City of Los Angeles

action, the City of
San Diego will deem the rulings applicable to its complaint.

City of Atlanta, Georgia v. Hotels.com L.P., et al.

:  On
March 29, 2006, the City of Atlanta, Georgia filed a complaint in the Superior
Court of Fulton County, Georgia.  In
addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for a declaratory
judgment, conversion, unjust enrichment, a constructive trust and a demand for
an equitable accounting.  On June 5,
2006, certain defendants, including the Company and its subsidiaries, answered
the complaint.  The parties proceeded to
conduct discovery.  On October 12, 2006,
as directed by the court, the defendants submitted briefs regarding the City of
Atlanta’s failure to exhaust the administrative remedies dictated by Georgia
law and its own


ordinance.  On
December 12, 2006, the court dismissed the City of Atlanta’s action for lack of
jurisdiction because the City of Atlanta failed to exhaust mandatory
administrative remedies prior to bringing suit. 
On January 10, 2007, the City of Atlanta filed a notice of appeal to the
court’s order deciding it lacked jurisdiction. 
In addition, the City of Atlanta has indicated its intention to commence
an administrative procedure by the City’s License Review Board, as required by
the Court’s order.

City of Charleston, South Carolina v. Hotel.com, et al.

:  On
April 26, 2006, the City of Charleston, South Carolina filed a complaint in the
Court of Common Pleas, Ninth Judicial Circuit of South Carolina.  In addition to the tax claims, the complaint
also asserts claims for conversion, a constructive trust and a demand for a
legal accounting.  On May 31, 2006,
defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the
District of South Carolina, Charleston Division.  On July 7, 2006, the defendants answered the
complaint.  On January 23, 2007, the City
of Charleston moved to amend the complaint to assert claims arising under the
South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.  
That motion is being briefed.  The
parties are currently conducting discovery.

Town of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina v. Hotels.com, et al.

:  On
May 23, 2006, the Town of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina filed a complaint in
the Court of Common Pleas, Ninth Judicial Circuit of South Carolina.  On July 21, 2006, the defendants removed the
case to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina,
Charleston Division.  On September 15,
2006, the defendants answered the complaint. 
The parties are currently conducting discovery.  On January 22, 2007, the Town of Mount
Pleasant moved to amend the complaint to assert claims arising under the South
Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. 
That motion is being briefed.

City of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On
August 28, 2006, the City of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina filed a
complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of South
Carolina.  On October 27, 2006, the
Company and certain other defendants removed the case to the United States
District Court for the District of South Carolina, Florence Division.  On December 1, 2006, the defendants filed
their motion to dismiss the complaint. 
On January 7, 2007, the City of North Myrtle Beach filed a motion to
remand this action to the state court. 
Both of those motions are fully briefed and awaiting decision.

Miami-Dade County and Ian Yorty, Miami-Dade County Tax Collector v.
Internetwork Publishing Corp., et al.

:  On September 21, 2006,
Miami-Dade County and its tax collector filed a complaint in the Circuit Court,
Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida.  In addition to the claim for Tourist and
Convention Development taxes, the complaint also asserted claims under the
Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and claims for breach of
fiduciary and agency duties, unjust enrichment, an equitable accounting, a
declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. 
On November 20, 2006, the Company, its subsidiaries named as defendants,
and other defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs’ complaint.  On November 22, 2006, the same group of
defendants moved to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss,
and the motion to stay was granted on December 7, 2006.  On January 17, 2007, the court conducted a
hearing on the pending motion to dismiss, at which it indicated it was inclined
to dismiss most of plaintiffs’ claims and that it would force the plaintiffs to
bring its surviving claim initially against one defendant instead of all of
them.  On January 18, 2007, the
plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss this action voluntarily.

Wake County v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On
November 3, 2006, Wake County, North Carolina filed a complaint in the General

violation of North Carolina General Statute § 75-1,

et seq

.,
and breach of agency duties and statutory penalties.  On January 31, 2007, the defendants moved to
dismiss this action, which is in the process of being briefed.  On


February 1, 2007, the defendants moved to designate
the case as a complex business case subject to the jurisdiction of the North
Carolina Business Court.

violation of North Carolina General Statute § 75-1,

et seq.

,
and breach of agency duties and statutory penalties.  On February 12, 2007, the defendants moved to
dismiss this action (which motion is in the process of being briefed) and moved
to designate the case as a complex business case subject to the jurisdiction of
the North Carolina Business Court.

City of Branson v. Hotels.com, LP., et al.

:  On
December 28, 2006, the City of Branson, Missouri filed a complaint in the

Dare County v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On
January 26, 2007, Dare County, North Carolina filed a complaint in the General
Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, Dare County, North Carolina.  In addition to the claim for Room Occupancy

et seq

.,
and breach of agency duties and statutory penalties.  On February 5, 2007, the Company and

Buncombe County v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On
February 1, 2007, Buncombe County, North Carolina filed a complaint in the
General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division, Buncombe County, North Carolina.  In addition to the Company and those
subsidiaries named in certain of the foregoing litigations (Lowestfare.com
Incorporated and Travelweb LLC), the complaint also names priceline.com LLC as
a defendant.  The complaint seeks a
declaratory judgment that the defendants are liable for occupancy taxes, as
well as supplemental relief including, without limitation, an accounting and a
determination of the amount of taxes due but unpaid.  Buncombe County also has designated its
complaint as a mandatory complex business case subject to the jurisdiction of
the North Carolina Business Court.  On
February 5, 2007, the Company, priceline.com LLC and Travelweb LLC were served
with the complaint, but they have not yet responded.

Horry County, et al. v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On
February 2, 2007, Horry County, South Carolina and the Horry County
Administrator filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas, Horry
County.  The complaint seeks a declaratory
judgment that the defendants are liable for occupancy taxes and that the
plaintiffs are entitled to other relief, including penalties and interest.  On February 21, 2007, the Company and its

City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina v. Hotels.com, LP, et al.

:  On
February 2, 2007, the City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina filed a complaint in
the Court of Common Pleas, Horry County. 
The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that the defendants are
liable for occupancy taxes and that the plaintiff is entitled to other relief,
including penalties and interest.  The
Company and its subsidiaries have not yet been served with the complaint.

We have also been informed by counsel to the plaintiffs in certain of
the aforementioned actions that various, undisclosed municipalities or taxing
jurisdictions may file additional cases against the


Company, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC
in the future.  In approximately February
2006, the Company became aware of an opinion by the City Attorney of the City
of Madison, Wisconsin that online travel companies were subject to the City of
Madison, Wisconsin’s hotel occupancy tax. 
Since that time, City officials have expressed an interest in filing
suit against the Company, but neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
has been served with or otherwise received any complaint brought on behalf of
the City of Madison.

The
Company intends to defend vigorously against the claims in all of the
aforementioned proceedings.  The Company
is unable at this time to predict the outcome of these proceedings or
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

Consumer
Class Actions

Marshall, et al. v. priceline.com, Inc.

:  On
February 17, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware for New Castle County by Jeanne Marshall and
three other individuals on behalf of themselves and a putative class of
allegedly similarly situated consumers nationwide against the Company.  The complaint alleged that the Company
violated the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 2511,

et seq

., relating to its disclosures and charges to
customers to cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances nationwide,
and service fees.  The Company moved to
dismiss the complaint on April 21, 2005. 
The Company also moved to stay discovery until a determination of its
motion to dismiss the complaint and the court granted that stay on May 11,
2005.  On June 10, 2005, plaintiffs filed
an amended complaint that asserts claims under the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act
and for breach of contract and the implied duty of good faith and fair
dealing.  The amended complaint seeks
compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and other relief.  On October 31, 2006, the court granted in
part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss.  The court dismissed all claims arising under
the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act.  The
court also dismissed all claims for breach of contract and the implied duty of
good faith and fair dealing that relate to Company’s charges for service
fees.  The court denied the Company’s
motion to dismiss the breach of contract and implied duty of good faith and
fair dealing claims as they relate to the Company’s charges to consumers to
cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances.

Bush, et al. v. Cheaptickets, Inc., et al.

:  On
February 17, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in Superior
Court for the County of Los Angeles by Ronald Bush and three other individuals
on behalf of themselves and other allegedly similarly situated California
consumers against the Company and several of the same defendants as named in
the

City of Los Angeles

action (discussed
above).  The complaint alleges each of
the defendants engaged in acts of unfair competition in violation of Section
17200 relating to their respective disclosures and charges to customers to
cover taxes under the above ordinances of the City of Los Angeles and other
California cities, and service fees.  The
complaint seeks restitution, relief for alleged conversion, including punitive
damages, injunctive relief, and imposition of a constructive trust.  On July 1, 2005, plaintiffs filed an amended
complaint, adding claims pursuant to California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act,
Civil Code §1750,

et seq

. and claims for breach of
contract and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.  On December 2, 2005, the court ordered
limited discovery and ordered that motions challenging the amended complaint
would be coordinated with any similar motions filed in the

City of Los
Angeles

action.  Since that
time, the Company has provided limited discovery and opposed the plaintiffs’
motion to compel further discovery.

The
Company intends to defend vigorously against the claims in all of the
aforementioned proceedings.  The Company
is unable at this time to predict the outcome of these proceedings or
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.


Other Possible Actions

At
various times the Company has also received inquiries or proposed tax
assessments from municipalities and other taxing jurisdictions relating to its
charges and remittance of amounts to cover state and local hotel occupancy and
other related taxes.  The City of New
Orleans, Louisiana, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and state tax
officials from Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, among others, have begun
formal or informal administrative procedures or stated that they may assert
claims against the Company relating to allegedly unpaid state or local hotel
occupancy or related taxes.  In addition,
the State of New Jersey Department of Taxation has begun an audit related to
the state’s Corporation Business Tax. 
The Company is unable at this time to predict whether any such
proceedings or assertions will result in litigation.

The
Company intends to defend vigorously against the claims in all of the
aforementioned proceedings.  The Company
is unable at this time to predict the outcome of these proceedings or
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

Litigation Related to Securities Matters

On
March 16, March 26, April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four putative
class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay
Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ.
3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other
defendants and states claims unrelated to priceline.com.  The complaints allege, among other things,
that we and the individual defendants violated the federal securities laws by
issuing and selling priceline.com common stock in our March 1999 initial public
offering without disclosing to investors that some of the underwriters in the
offering, including the lead underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received
excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors.  By Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge Scheindlin
dated August 8, 2001, these cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes with
hundreds of other cases, which contain allegations concerning the allocation of
shares in the initial public offerings of companies other than priceline.com.  By Order of Judge Scheindlin dated August 14,
2001, the following cases were consolidated for all purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ.
3590.  On April 19, 2002, plaintiffs
filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with respect
to both our March 1999 initial public offering and our August 1999 second
public offering of common stock.  The named
defendants are priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E.
Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman, Timothy G. Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &
Co., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.,
Robertson Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest to BancBoston), Credit
Suisse First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney,
Inc.  Priceline, Richard Braddock, Jay
Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier, together with other
issuer defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a joint motion to
dismiss on July 15, 2002.  On November
18, 2002, the cases against the individual defendants were dismissed without
prejudice and without costs.  In
addition, counsel for plaintiffs and the individual defendants executed
Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes of
limitations on plaintiffs’ claims against those individuals.  On February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin issued
an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the issuer’s
motion.  None of the claims against
priceline.com were dismissed.  On June
26, 2003, counsel for the plaintiff class announced that they and counsel for
the issuers had agreed to the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”)
to settle claims against the issuers. 
The terms of


that Memorandum provide that class members will be
guaranteed $1 billion in recoveries by the insurers of the issuers and that
settling issuer defendants will assign to the class members certain claims that
they may have against the underwriters. 
Issuers also agree to limit their abilities to bring certain claims
against the underwriters.  If recoveries
in excess of $1 billion are obtained by the class from any non-settling
defendants, the settling defendants’ monetary obligations to the class
plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount recovered from the underwriters that
is less than $1 billion will be paid by the insurers on behalf of the
issuers.  The Memorandum, which is
subject to the approval of each issuer, was approved by a special committee of
the priceline.com Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff class
and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form of a Stipulation and Agreement
of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and Individuals (“Settlement Agreement”).  The Settlement Agreement implements the
Memorandum and contains the same material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a special committee of the
priceline.com Board of Directors authorized our counsel to execute the
Settlement Agreement on our behalf.  The
Settlement Agreement is subject to final approval by the Court and the process
to obtain that approval is still pending. 
However, the ultimate confirmation of the settlement agreement is
uncertain in light of the Second Circuit’s ruling denying class certification
in certain of the lead cases.  The
implications of the Second Circuit’s ruling on the settlement agreement are
still being reviewed by all parties and the District Court.

Subsequent to our
announcement on September 27, 2000, that revenues for the third quarter 2000
would not meet expectations, we were served with the following putative class

All of these cases were assigned to Judge Dominic J.
Squatrito.  On September 12, 2001, Judge
Squatrito ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master File No.
3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’
counsel.  On October 29, 2001, plaintiffs
served a Consolidated Amended Complaint. 
On February 5, 2002, Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., who was one of
the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action, made a motion for leave to
withdraw as lead plaintiff.  The Court
granted that motion on May 30, 2002.  On
February 28, 2002, we filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended
Complaint.  On October 7, 2004, the Court
issued a Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying, in part, our
motion.  An initial scheduling order was
entered by the Court on November 2, 2004 and the parties are now proceeding
with discovery.  Plaintiffs filed a
motion for class certification on January 7, 2005, and we have filed our
opposition to that motion.  On April 4,
2006, the Court issued a Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying,
in part, the plaintiffs’ motion.  The
Court certified a class and approved five of the six proposed class representatives.  On May 4, 2006, the case was transferred to
Judge Christopher F. Droney.  Plaintiffs
filed a motion for an order approving the proposed notice of class
certification on May 5, 2006 and the Company filed its response to that
motion.  On May 18, 2006, the case was
transferred to Judge Alfred V. Covello. 
On October 30, 2006, the Court issued an Order setting forth a partial
schedule, designating December 31, 2007 as the deadline for the completion of
discovery.  We intend to defend
vigorously against this action.  We are
unable to predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably estimate a range of
possible loss, if any.

In
addition, on November 1, 2000, we were served with a complaint that purported
to be a shareholder derivative action against our Board of Directors and
certain of our current and former executive officers, as well as

priceline.com

(as a nominal defendant).  The
complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets.  The action is captioned

Mark Zimmerman
v. Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D. Schulman, P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney,
W. Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N. Peretsman, and priceline.com Incorporated,
18473-NC (Court of Chancery of Delaware, County of New Castle, State of
Delaware).  On February 6, 2001, all defendants
moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to make a demand upon the Board of
Directors and failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can be
granted.  Pursuant to a stipulation by
the parties, an amended complaint was filed on June 21, 2001.  Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss on
August 20, 2001.  On December 20, 2002,
the Court granted defendants’ motion without prejudice.  On April 25, 2003, a second amended
complaint, adding H. Miller, was filed and a motion seeking leave of court to
file the second amended complaint was filed on July 28, 2003.  That motion was fully briefed, and oral
argument took place on May 9, 2005. Immediately following oral argument, the
Court dismissed three of the four counts in the second amended complaint.  All of the counts against defendants Allaire,
Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller, Peretsman and Schulman have now been
dismissed.  On September 8, 2005, the
Court granted plaintiff leave to file the second amended complaint as to the
one remaining count.  Defendants filed a
motion requesting that the Court certify its September 8, 2005 order for
interlocutory appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, and the Court granted that
motion on October 6, 2005.  On October
17, 2005, the Delaware Supreme Court accepted the interlocutory appeal.  The appeal was fully briefed, and oral
argument took place on February 22, 2006. 
In an Order dated April 3, 2006, the Delaware Supreme Court stated that
the appeal would be scheduled for oral argument and determination by the Court

en banc

without further briefing.  The

en banc

argument took place on June 28, 2006.  On
September 12, 2006, the Delaware Supreme Court decided in favor of the Company
and the Delaware action was therefore dismissed with prejudice by stipulation.

On
November 7, 2003, we were served with a complaint that purported to be a
shareholder derivative action against our Board of Directors and certain of our
current and former executive officers, as well as

priceline.com

(as a nominal defendant).  The complaint
alleged, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate
assets and misappropriation of corporate information.

The claims in the complaint appear to
be substantially repetitive of the claims pending in the derivative action in Delaware
which is described above.

The action is captioned Don Powell

v.
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker,


Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna,
Paul J. Blackney, William E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B.
Peretsman, and Heidi G. Miller and priceline.com Incorporated (Superior Court,
Judicial District of Stamford/Norwalk, State of Connecticut).  On January 28, 2004, defendants Blackney,
Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of
personal jurisdiction.  On January 29,
2004, defendant Miller moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction and for insufficient service of process.  On February 27, 2004, defendants Braddock,
Walker, Schulman, Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Loeb, Nicholas, Peretsman, Miller
and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman also moved to dismiss the
complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of
process.  At a hearing on May 3, 2004,
the Court stated that it would not rule on the pending motions until the
pending motions in the Delaware action described above are decided.  The Court conducted a subsequent status conference
on January 10, 2005, at which it requested that the parties report back no
later than March 15, 2005 on the status of the Delaware derivative suit.  On March 15, 2005, the parties informed the
Court in writing that the oral argument in the Delaware case had been postponed
until May 9, 2005, and that the parties would contact the Court with a status
report after that hearing was held.  The
Delaware Court dismissed three of the four counts in the second amended
complaint in the Delaware derivative suit. 
All of the counts against the defendants Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Ford,
Loeb, Miller, Peretsman and Schulman have now been dismissed.  The parties in the Connecticut action advised
the Connecticut Court of the Delaware Court’s ruling by letter dated June 6,
2005.  The Delaware Court subsequently
granted plaintiff leave to file the second amended complaint as to the one
remaining count.  Defendants sought an
interlocutory appeal of the Delaware Court’s order, and the Delaware Supreme
Court accepted that appeal.  The parties
in the Connecticut action advised the Connecticut Court of those developments
by letter dated November 3, 2005. 
Following the September 12, 2006 decision by the Delaware Supreme Court
and the subsequent dismissal of the Delaware derivative action, plaintiffs in
the Connecticut action executed a Withdrawal of their case on January 30, 2007.

Other
Litigation

On
January 6, 1999, we received notice that a third party patent applicant
and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston, purportedly had filed in
December 1998 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office a request
to declare an interference between a patent application filed by Woolston and
our U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  We are
currently awaiting information from the Patent Office regarding whether it will
initiate an interference proceeding.

From
time to time, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of
alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights by it.  Such claims, even if not meritorious, could
result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources,
divert management’s attention from our business objectives and could adversely
affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Item
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

The following
discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements,
including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K,
and the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in
this Form 10-K.  As discussed in more
detail in the Section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” this discussion contains forward-looking statements which involve
risks and uncertainties.  Our actual
results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking
statements.  Factors that might cause
those differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk
Factors.”

Overview

General

.  We are a leading online travel
company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including
airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages, cruises and
destination services.  We offer our
customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase travel services in a
traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your Own Price

®

service, which allows our customers to make
offers for travel services at discounted prices.  At present, we derive substantially all of
our revenues from the following sources:

·

Transaction revenues from
our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room
and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages service;

·

Commissions earned from the
sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, rental cars, cruises and other travel
services;

·

Customer processing fees
charged in connection with the sale of both

Name
Your Own Price

®

and price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel
rooms and rental cars services;

·

Transaction revenue from our
price-disclosed hotel room service;

·

Global distribution system (“GDS”)
reservation booking fees related to both our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car
services, and price-disclosed airline tickets and rental car services; and

·

Other revenues derived
primarily from selling advertising on our websites.

Trends

.  The
online sale of travel services has been one of the fastest growing sectors of
the Internet since the late 1990s.  While
the online market for travel services continues to experience significant
annualized growth, we believe that the domestic market share of third-party
distributors, like priceline.com, has declined over the recent past and that
the growth of the domestic online market for travel services has slowed.  We believe the decline in market share is
attributable, in part, to a concerted initiative by travel suppliers to direct
customers to their own websites in an effort to reduce distribution expenses and
establish more direct control over their pricing.  In addition, over the course of 2005 and
2006, airlines and hotel chains generally experienced year-over-year increases
in load factors (a common metric that measures airplane customer usage) and
occupancy rates (a common metric that measures hotel customer usage),
respectively, which leaves them with less excess inventory to provide third
party intermediaries like priceline.com. 
Notwithstanding these trends, we continue to believe that the market for
online travel services is an attractive market with continued opportunity for
growth, in particular, in certain international markets.

Because
we believe that an opportunity for growth exists in certain international
markets, and since prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 substantially all of our
revenue was generated in the U.S., we have taken steps to expand the markets we
serve.  In September 2004, we acquired
Booking.com Limited (formerly known as Active Hotels Ltd.), a U.K. based online
hotel service.  Booking.com Limited gives


us a strong presence in the U.K.’s online hotel
market.  Furthermore, in July 2005, we
acquired Amsterdam-based Booking.com B.V. (formerly known as Bookings B.V.),
one of Europe’s leading Internet hotel reservation services, with offices
primarily in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Loule, Paris, Rome and Vienna.  All of our European operations, including
Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., are majority-owned by us.  A minority interest in our European business
is held by our European managers responsible for that business.  We work with a range of chain-owned and
independently owned hotels across Europe and in major cities around the world
to provide hotel reservations on various websites in multiple languages.

Our
European operations represented approximately 40.6% of our gross bookings in
the year ended December 31, 2006, and were a substantial contributor to our
consolidated operating income during that period and we expect that throughout
2007 they will represent a growing percentage of our total gross bookings and
operating income.  As our European
operations have become more meaningful contributors to our results, we have
seen, and expect to continue to see, changes in certain of our operating
expenses and other financial metrics. 
For example, because our European operations utilize online affiliate
and search marketing as principal means of generating traffic to their
websites, our online advertising expense has increased significantly since our
acquisition of those companies, a trend we expect to continue throughout
2007.  In addition, and as discussed in
more detail below, since the acquisitions of Booking.com Limited and
Booking.com B.V., we have seen the effects of seasonal fluctuation on our
results change as a result of different revenue recognition policies that apply
to our European hotel service (as well as our domestic retail hotel service)
and the increased importance of European hotel bookings to our results of
operations.

The
financial prospects of our domestic business have been and continue to be significantly
dependent upon the sale of leisure airline tickets and, as a result, the health
of our domestic business has been directly related to the health of the airline
industry.  In recent years, most domestic
airlines, and many of our major suppliers, experienced significant losses.  Those losses were compounded by competition
from low-cost carriers and high fuel prices. 
As a result of these and other factors, many of the major airlines
deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain market share, simplified
fare structures by removing restrictions associated with certain airline
tickets and reduced their total capacity to increase load factors.  Those actions had a detrimental effect on our
overall airline business and, in particular, our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service, which is negatively
impacted by (1) increased load factors as airlines have less excess inventory
to provide to third party intermediaries in general, and to lower yielding “opaque”
services, in particular, like our

Name Your
Own Price

®

service, and (2) deep retail
discounting because it hurts our value proposition and makes users less willing
to accept the trade-offs associated with the

Name
Your Own Price

®

service, for what has become, in
many cases, modest fare savings.

We rely on fees paid to us
by global distribution systems, or GDSs, for travel bookings made through GDSs
for a portion of our gross profit and a substantial portion of our operating
income. We rebate certain GDS costs to certain suppliers (e.g., airlines,
hotels, etc.) in exchange for contractual considerations such as those relating
to pricing and availability, and expect to continue to do so in the
future.  During 2006, most agreements
between GDSs and the major domestic airlines expired, and most airlines have
negotiated new agreements with reduced distribution costs for the airlines that
went into effect September 1, 2006.  The
structure of these new agreements, along with airline pressure on third-party
travel intermediaries, such as us, to operate under the new structures, require
us to reduce our aggregate compensation and book through lower cost channels to
receive airlines’ full content and avoid airline service fees.  We have entered into new agreements with a
number of airlines to obtain access to airline content, and are in continuing
discussions with others to obtain similar access.  If we were denied access to airlines’ full
content or had to incur service fees on our airline tickets, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.


Additionally, some travel suppliers are
encouraging third-party travel intermediaries, such as us, to develop
technology to bypass the traditional GDSs, such as enabling direct connections
to the travel suppliers or using alternative global distribution methods
recently developed by new entrants to the global distribution marketplace, such
as G2 Switchworks Corp.  Such new
entrants propose using technology that is less complex than traditional global
distribution systems, and that enables the distribution of airline tickets in a
manner that is more cost-effective to the airline suppliers.  To this end, in the first quarter 2006, we
entered into agreements with Sabre Inc. and G2 Switchworks for the provision of
GDS services.  Development of the
technology to connect to such alternative GDSs, or to enable direct connections
to travel suppliers, requires the use of information technology resources and
could cause us to incur additional operating expenses, increase the
frequency/duration of system problems and delay other projects.  Furthermore, our contractual obligations to
Worldspan, L.P. may limit our ability to pursue the most financially attractive
GDS options during the term of our agreement with Worldspan, L.P., which
expires December 31, 2007.

As a result of the continued
decline in sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets over the last several years,
we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our revenue
among “non-opaque” services, such as allowing our customers to purchase
price-disclosed retail airline, hotel, rental car and other travel services,
which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal.

We intend to continue to
execute on our strategy of diversifying our service offerings and markets,
through both continued internal development of services and, if appropriate,
acquisitions.  As a result of the
diversification described above, the growth rates for our “agency” businesses,
which are generally comprised of our price-disclosed retail services, have,
over the recent past, significantly exceeded the growth rates for our “merchant”
businesses, which are comprised primarily of our slower-growing

Name Your Own Price

®

services.

We believe that our success
will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily
from our leisure travel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com
brand and, over time, to offer other travel services and further expand into
international markets. Factors beyond our control, such as the outbreak of an
epidemic or pandemic disease; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis or
earthquakes; terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle East or elsewhere; or
the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of
an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline (or
the consolidation of our major airline suppliers) or hotel supplier, could
adversely affect our business and results of operations and impair our ability
to effectively implement all or some of the initiatives described above.  We intend to continue to invest in marketing
and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters consistent with
attempts to improve operating results. 
We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, and to that end, we
explore strategic alternatives from time to time in the form of, among other
things, mergers and acquisitions.  Our
goal is to improve volume and sustain gross margins in an effort to maintain
profitability. The uncertain environment described above makes the prediction
of future results of operations difficult, and accordingly, we cannot provide
assurance that we will sustain revenue growth and profitability.

Seasonality

.  Prior to introducing a retail travel option
to our customers, substantially all of our business was conducted under the

Name Your Own Price

®

system and
accordingly, because those services are non-refundable in nature, we recognize
travel revenue at the time a booking was generated.  However, we recognize revenue generated from
our retail hotel services, including our European operations, at the time that
the customer checks out of the hotel.  As
a result, a meaningful amount of retail hotel bookings generated earlier in the
year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations, will not
be recognized until future quarters. From a cost perspective, however, we
expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as they are
incurred, which is typically in the quarter in


which bookings are generated.  Therefore, as our retail hotel business
continues to grow, we expect our quarterly results to become increasingly
impacted by these seasonal factors.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements.

As more fully discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements, we adopted SFAS 123(R) as of January 1, 2006.  SFAS 123(R) had a significant impact on our
Consolidated Statement of Operations as we are required to expense the fair
value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the pro forma impact on
our consolidated operations within our footnotes.  Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of
unvested stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2005 increased personnel
expense by approximately $6.1 million in 2006, and is estimated to increase
personnel expense by approximately $2.4 million in 2007 and $0.6 million in
2008.

In
July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Uncertainty
in Income Taxes.” FIN 48 applies to all tax positions and clarifies the
recognition of tax benefits in the financial statements by providing for a
two-step approach of recognition and measurement. The first step involves
assessing whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon
examination based upon its technical merits. The second step involves
measurement of the amount to recognize. 
Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured
at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being
realized upon ultimate finalization with the taxing authority.  FIN 48 became effective on January 1, 2007.
Management does not believe that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material
impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are
based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting
policies are particularly important to our financial position and results of
operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as
a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently
uncertain. In applying those policies, our management uses its judgment to
determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of
certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to the items described below. Those estimates are based on, among
other things, historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance
of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  A summary of our significant accounting
policies that involve significant estimates and judgments of management,
including the following:

·

Merchant Revenues and
Merchant Cost of Revenues

Name Your Own Price

®

Services

:  Merchant
revenues and related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where we
are the merchant of record and are responsible for, among other things,
collecting receipts from our customers, selecting suppliers, remitting payments
to our suppliers and determining the price we will accept from the customer. We
recognize such revenue and costs if and when we accept and fulfill the customer’s
non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include
the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel services and are
reported on a gross basis.  Pursuant to
the terms of our hotel service, our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us
for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of time.  In the event that we are not billed by our hotel
supplier within the specified time period, we reduce our cost of revenues by
the unbilled amounts.


Merchant
Price-Disclosed Hotel Service:

Merchant
revenues for our

merchant price-disclosed

hotel service are derived
from transactions where customers use our service to purchase hotel rooms from
hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements.  Charges are billed to customers at the time
of booking and are included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer
completes his or her stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon
cancellation prior to stay, subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases.
Merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at
the conclusion of the customer’s stay at the hotel. We record the difference
between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue.

·

Agency Revenues and
Cost of Revenues

.

Agency revenues are derived from travel related
transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices of
the products sold are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include
travel commissions, customer processing fees and GDS reservation booking fees
and are reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of
revenue. Such revenues are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s
travel.  We provide an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on past experience and the age of commissions
receivable.

·

Deferred Tax Valuation Allowance

.  As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes,” we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of
deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax
assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be
realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future
realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative
earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable
income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
and other relevant factors.  Based upon
management’s assessment of positive and negative evidence, we recorded non-cash
tax benefits in 2006 and 2005 of $28.1 million and $170.5 million,
respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of our valuation allowance
on our deferred tax assets.  We believe
that it is more likely than not that our remaining deferred tax assets will not
be realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance against those assets
remains.  The valuation allowance may
need to be adjusted in the future if facts and circumstances change.

·

Accounting for State
and Local “Hotel Occupancy” Taxes

.  As discussed
in Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, several jurisdictions have
initiated lawsuits against several on-line travel companies, including us,
alleging among other things, that sales or hotel occupancy tax is applicable to
the differential between the price paid by a customer for our service and the
cost of the underlying room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this
differential. Additional state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are
subject to sales or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek
to collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively, or both. To the
extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection
responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline.com
service, we might have additional tax exposures.  We will continue to
assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposures,
and to the extent appropriate, we reserve for those estimated liabilities.


·

Airline
Debit Memos.

Our airline suppliers periodically send us debit
memos that make claims for additional amounts due to them related to the cost
of airline tickets we sold on their behalf. 
We process the debit memos received and, when appropriate, make payments
to the airlines.  Based on our historical
experience and our contractual arrangements with the airlines, we establish
reserves for estimated losses when appropriate resulting from these claims.

·

Allowance
for Credit Card Charge-backs.

Because we act as merchant of record in
the majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for accepting
fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment disputes with
our customers. Additionally, we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent
credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as merchant of
record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting
credit card charge-backs.

·

Valuation of Goodwill

. 
We have recorded goodwill related to businesses we have acquired
including Booking.com B.V., Booking.com Limited, Travelweb and priceline.com
europe Ltd. Goodwill is

reviewed at least annually for impairment using
appropriate valuation techniques.  In the
event that future circumstances indicate that any portion of our goodwill is
impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded.

·

Valuation
of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles.

We evaluate
whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying
amounts of long-lived assets and intangibles may be impaired or not
recoverable. The significant factors that are considered that could trigger an
impairment review include changes in business strategies, market conditions, or
the manner of use of an asset; under performance relative to historical or
expected future operating results; and negative industry or economic trends.  In evaluating an asset for possible
impairment, management estimates that asset’s future undiscounted cash flows to
measure whether the asset is recoverable. If it is determined that the asset is
not recoverable, we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted
cash flows of the asset over its remaining life.

·

Stock-Based
Compensation.

We record
stock-based compensation expense over the service period based upon the grant
date fair value of equity-based grants. 
We estimate forfeiture rates in determining the amount of compensation
to record.  In addition, we record
stock-based compensation expense for grants that include a performance
contingency based upon the estimated probable outcome at the end of the
performance period.  We periodically
adjust the cumulative stock-based compensation recorded when estimated
forfeiture rates are adjusted, or when the probable outcome for
performance-based shares is updated based upon changes in facts and
circumstances.

·

Equity
Investments.

W

e have, among other investments, a 49%
equity interest in pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, recognize our pro
rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed an
amount that we believe represents the investment’s estimated fair value.  The carrying value of the investment at
December 31, 2006 was $9.5 million.  We
periodically test this investment for impairment using a number of assumptions
and estimates.  In the event that future
circumstances indicate that our investment in pricelinemortgage.com is
impaired, an impairment charge would be recorded.


Results of Operations

Year Ended
December 31, 2006 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Operating
Metrics

Our
financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the
selling activity generated by our travel services.  Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our
customers.  Gross Bookings capture the
total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel services purchased
by our customers.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days
sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows:

Gross bookings increased by 49.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to the same period in 2005.  The
increase was driven primarily by an increase of 85.6% in “agency” bookings for
the year ended December 31, 2006, which was primarily attributable to (1)
growth in our European operations, which are substantially comprised of
Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third
quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively; (2) an increase in the average fare of
our retail ticket service, and (3) the increased sale of retail rental
cars.  Merchant gross bookings increased
by 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in
2005.  The increase was primarily due to
an increase in merchant gross bookings relating to our domestic retail hotel
service, an increase in the average daily rate of our

Name Your Own Price

hotel service and an increase in
the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

rental car days.

Airline tickets sold increased by 0.2% for the year ended December 31,
2006, over the same period in 2005.  The
increase in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31,
2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily attributable to an
increase in the sale of retail airline tickets, partially offset by a decrease
in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets.

Hotel room nights sold increased
by 58.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, over the same period in
2005.  The increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the year
ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005, was primarily due
to growth in our hotel room nights sold through (1) our European operations,
which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com Limited,
which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
(2) our domestic retail hotel service.  This increase was partially offset
by a decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own
Price

®

hotel
room nights.  Our retail hotel service
benefited from the enhanced integration of our retail and

Name Your Own Price

services in the first quarter of
2006.   We believe that the benefit
to our retail hotel service came partially at the expense of sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights during the year ended
December 31, 2006, as some amount of demand that may otherwise have been
directed to the

Name Your Own Price

®

service instead was directed to
our retail hotel service.


Rental car days sold increased by 28.1% for the year ended December 31,
2006, over the same period in 2005, due to increases in sales of both our
retail and

rental
car services, which benefited from the launch of enhanced integration of retail
and

®

services in the first quarter 2006, as well as
from the launch of new features in 2005, including options for one-way
destination and off-airport car rentals.

Revenues

We classify our revenue into three categories:

·

Merchant
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and
are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our
customers, selecting suppliers and remitting payments to our suppliers.  Merchant revenues include (1) transaction
revenues representing the selling price of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and
price-disclosed vacation packages; (2) transaction revenues representing the
amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by suppliers in
connection with the hotel rooms provided through our merchant price-disclosed
hotel service; (3) customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale
of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and
rental cars and merchant price-disclosed hotels; and (4) ancillary fees,
including GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned
transactions.

·

Agency
revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the
merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third
parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees
and GDS reservation booking fees related to certain of the aforementioned
transactions and are reported at the net amounts received, without any
associated cost of revenue.

·

Other revenues are derived
primarily from advertising on our websites.

We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket
business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of
merchant (“opaque”)

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services to a business
that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services.  Because merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are
primarily recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are
impacted by changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services
and, consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of
evaluating growth in our business. 
Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $182.7
million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, which are
primarily recorded on a “net” basis.

rental car days,

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights, and vacation packages.  A substantial portion of the increase was due
to services sold through our agreement with Orbitz, which we entered into on
January 1, 2006.  Under our agreement
with Orbitz, we paid fees in exchange for a link on the Orbitz website that
directed traffic to the

Name Your Own Price

®

service.  The agreement expired on December 31,
2006.  While the Orbitz agreement
provided us with a good source of traffic, we believe it was likely dilutive in
that many of the customers that we paid Orbitz for may have purchased our
travel services anyway.  While the
expiration of the Orbitz agreement may result in decreased merchant volume in
2007 — we estimate potentially up to approximately 5% of our 2007 merchant
volume after taking into account estimated dilution - it frees up marketing
dollars that we may use in other online channels.

Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 116% compared to the
same period in 2005, primarily as a result of (1) growth in our European
operations, which contributed $179 million of agency revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2006, and $67 million of agency revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2005; and (2) increased sales of domestic retail hotel room nights
and retail rental car days.  Results from
our European operations are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and
Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Other Revenues

Other
revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted primarily of: (1)
advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to
pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services.  Other revenues for the year ended December
31, 2006 increased 19.7%, compared to the same period in 2005, primarily as a
result of higher online advertising revenue related to the inclusion of results
of operation from our online advertising company since it was acquired in June
2006.

transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross”
with a corresponding cost of revenue while retail transactions are recorded “net”
with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Cost of
Merchant Revenues

For the year ended December
31, 2006, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of
opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of
opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air
transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in
connection with the sale of airline tickets; and (3) the cost of opaque rental
cars from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes.  Cost of merchant revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2006 increased 4.0%, compared to the same period in 2005, due
primarily to the fact that merchant revenues increased comparably in the same
period.  Merchant price-disclosed hotel
revenues are recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less
amounts paid to suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of
merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues.

Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less
amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and therefore, there are no costs of agency
revenues.  For the year ended December
31, 2005, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash amortization
expenses associated with acquisition activity.


Cost of
Other Revenues

For the years ended December
31, 2006 and 2005, there were no costs of other revenues.

Gross Profit

Total gross profit for the
year ended December 31, 2006 increased by 49.7% compared to the same period in
2005, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1) our European
operations, which are substantially comprised of Booking.com B.V. and
Booking.com Limited, which were acquired in the third quarters of 2005 and
2004, respectively; and (2) increased sales of retail hotel room nights.  The contribution to gross profit from airline
ticket sales during the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively impacted by
a decrease in net GDS fees per ticket as compared to the same period in 2005,
which contributed to lower margins on retail ticket sales in particular. Total
gross margin (gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue)
increased during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to the same period
in 2005, because

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions, whose revenues are recorded “gross”
with a corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of
transactions compared to retail, price-disclosed transactions which are
primarily recorded “net” with no corresponding cost of revenues.  Because

Name
Your Own Price

®

transactions are reported “gross” and retail
transactions are primarily recorded on a “net” basis, we believe that gross
profit has become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our
business.

Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
differs from the expected tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of 35% because
it includes benefits amounting to $28.1 million and $170.5 million,
respectively, resulting from a reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance
on our deferred tax assets.  Other items
resulting in a difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate
include the foreign tax benefit of interest expense on intercompany debt, and
lower foreign tax rates, partly offset by state income taxes.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
Netherlands enacted a reduction in its statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%,
effective January 1, 2007.  We recognized
a benefit of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulting from the
impact on deferred taxes of the Netherlands tax


rate reduction.  Due to our
significant net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay
significant cash taxes on our U.S. federal taxable income tax for the
foreseeable future.  We expect to make
cash payments for U.S. alternative minimum tax and for certain international
taxes.

Equity in income (loss) of
investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005, represented (1) minority interests associated with the ownership of
priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business;
and (2) equity in income (loss) of investees, principally comprised of our pro
rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net results.  The change in equity in income of investees
and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase
in the minority interest in the earnings of priceline.com International and a
decrease in earnings of and an impairment charge recorded for our investment in
pricelinemortgage.com.  Due to recent
losses incurred by pricelinemortgage.com, we reviewed the carrying value of our
investment for impairment.  Based upon
recent operating results and future projected results, we determined that our
investment was impaired on an other-than-temporary basis.  Accordingly, in the third quarter, we
recognized a charge of $1.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our equity
investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value.

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2005 compared to Year Ended
December 31, 2004

Operating Metrics

Our
financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the
selling activity generated by our travel services.  Specifically, sales of airline tickets, hotel
room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units purchased by our
customers.  Gross Bookings capture

the total dollar
value inclusive of taxes and fees of all travel

service

s purchased by
our customers.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days
sold through our websites and the related gross bookings were as follows:

Gross bookings
increased by 32.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared to the same
period in 2004.  The increase was driven
primarily by an increase of 81.6% in “agency” bookings for the


year
ended December 31, 2005, which was primarily attributable to (1) the inclusion
of approximately $468 million of gross bookings from our European operations;
(2) the increased sale of retail airline tickets; (3) the inclusion of agency
gross bookings relating to our retail hotel service launched in March 2005; and
(4) the increased sale of retail rental cars. 
Merchant gross bookings increased by 1.1% for the year ended December
31, 2005.  The increase was primarily due
to an increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel bookings, mostly offset by a
decrease in the sale of opaque airline tickets.

Airline tickets sold decreased by 0.6% for the year ended December 31,
2005, over the same period in 2004.  The
decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily attributable to a
significant percentage decrease in the sale of

Name

®

airline tickets, largely offset
by an increase in the sale of retail airline tickets.

Hotel room nights sold increased by 51.3% for the year ended December 31,
2005, over the same period in 2004.  The
increase in the number of hotel room nights sold in the year ended December 31,
2005, compared to the same period in 2004, was primarily due to the inclusion
of hotel room nights sold through our European operations, which are
substantially comprised of Booking.com Limited and Booking.com B.V., which were
acquired in the third quarters of 2004 and 2005, respectively, and our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service, which was integrated after our acquisition of Travelweb
during the second quarter 2004.  This
increase was partially offset by a decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel
room nights, in part due to the increased focus on our website of our merchant
price-disclosed hotel service.

Rental car days sold increased by 13.7% for the year ended December 31,
2005, over the same period in 2004 due to increases in sales of our opaque
rental car service, increases in sales of our retail rental car service, which
was launched in the fourth quarter of 2004, and the launch of new features,
including options for one-way destination and off-airport car rentals.

Revenues

We continue to experience a shift in the mix of our airline ticket
business from a business historically focused exclusively on the sale of merchant
(“opaque”)

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services to a business
that includes the sale of retail, price-disclosed travel services.  Because merchant

Name Your Own Price

®

travel
services are reported on a “gross” basis and retail travel services are primarily
recorded on a “net” basis, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by
changes in the mix of the sale of merchant and retail travel services and,
consequently, gross profit has become an increasingly important measure of
evaluating growth in our business. 
Additionally, our European operations contributed approximately $70
million to our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.  Revenues generated by our European operations
are primarily recorded on a “net” basis.

airline tickets, which was partially offset by
an increase in merchant price-disclosed hotel bookings.  We believe that the decrease in the number of

primarily to low retail airline ticket prices and the availability of retail
tickets on our website.  In particular,
we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be

airline
service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel
services at the lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers, without having
to make any trade-offs.

Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased 157%, compared to the
same period in 2004, primarily as a result of (1) the inclusion of
approximately $67 million of agency revenue for the year ended December 31,
2005, from our European operations; and (2) increased sales of retail airline
tickets, hotels and rental cars, partially offset by a decrease in Worldspan,
L.P. GDS fees.  Results from our European
operations consist of a full year of operations from Booking.com Limited, which
was acquired in September 2004, and approximately six months of operations from
Booking.com B.V., which was acquired in July 2005.

Other Revenues

Other
revenues during the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted primarily of: (1)
advertising revenues; and (2) fees for referring customers to
pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services.  Other revenues for the year ended December
31, 2005 increased compared to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result
of higher online advertising revenue.

transactions as compared to retail transactions which are recorded “net” with
no corresponding cost of revenues.

Cost of
Merchant Revenues

For the year ended December
31, 2005, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of
opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes, (2) the cost of
opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air
transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in
connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars
from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash
acquisition-related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of
Travelweb.  Cost of merchant revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased by 2.9%, compared to the same period
in 2004, due primarily to a decrease in overall merchant revenues.  Merchant price-disclosed hotel revenues are
recorded at their net amounts, which are amounts received less amounts paid to
suppliers and therefore, there are no associated costs of merchant
price-disclosed hotel revenues.

Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency
revenues are recorded at their net amount, which are amounts received less

Gross
Profit

Total
gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by 35.2% compared
to the same period in 2004, primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1)
the inclusion of results from our European operations which consist of a full
year of operations from Booking.com Limited which was acquired in September
2004, and approximately six months of operations from Booking.com B.V., which
was acquired in July 2005; and (2) increased sales of retail travel
services.  Total gross margin (gross
profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve

For the year ended December 31, 2005, interest

December 31, 2005 over the same period in 2004 because our 2.25% Convertible
Senior Notes issued in June 2004 were outstanding for the entire twelve month
period in 2005.

Taxes

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit of
approximately $156 million.  This
principally resulted from a non-cash tax benefit recorded in the third quarter
of 2005 of $171 million, relating to the reversal of a portion of our valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets. The non-cash tax benefit was recorded
pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, that require a company to release a portion of its deferred tax asset
valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not that it will realize
all or some portion of its deferred tax assets. Due to our significant net operating
loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay cash taxes on our U.S. federal
taxable income for the foreseeable future. 
As a result of the reversal, we recorded a mostly non-cash $12.5 million
provision for U.S. income tax expense in our Consolidated Financial Statements
in 2005, and will continue to record a non-cash provision for U.S. income tax
expense in future periods.  This non-cash
U.S. income tax provision will materially negatively impact net income and earnings
per share in subsequent periods as compared to prior periods.  We expect to make cash tax payments for U.S.
alternative minimum taxes and for certain international taxes.

Equity in income of
investees and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
2004, represented (1) our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net
results, (2) minority interests associated with the 8.5% ownership of
priceline.com International that is held by certain managers of that business
and (3) until May 2004, our pro rata share of Travelweb’s net results.  The increase in equity in income of investees
and minority interests versus the prior year was primarily due to increases in
equity


in income of investees related to (1) our equity in
the increase in pricelinemortgage.com’s net income in both periods and (2) the
exclusion of our equity in the net loss of Travelweb subsequent to our
acquisition of Travelweb in May 2004. 
This increase was partially offset by the inclusion of the
aforementioned minority interests in priceline.com International.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2006, we
had $431.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.  We generally invest excess cash to make such
funds readily available for operating purposes. 
Cash equivalents and short-term investments are primarily comprised of
highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt instruments.

All of our merchant
transactions are structured such that we collect cash up front from our
customers and then we pay most of our suppliers at a subsequent date.  We therefore tend to experience significant
swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of
revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter.  This can cause volatility in working capital
levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income would
indicate.

Net cash provided by
operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $112.1 million,
resulting from net income of $74.5 million, non-cash items not affecting 2006
cash flows of $32.7 million and $4.9 million of positive changes in working
capital.  The changes in working capital
for the year ended December 31, 2006, were primarily related to a $27.4 million
increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities,
partially offset by an $21.2 million increase in accounts receivable.  The increases in accounts receivable and
accounts payable were primarily due to an increase in merchant bookings in the
fourth quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005.  Accrued expenses and other current
liabilities increased primarily due to an $8.2 million increase in bonus
accruals and a $5.0 million increase in on-line advertising accruals.  Non-cash items were primarily associated with
the deferred income tax benefit, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation
and amortization.  The non-cash deferred
income tax benefit resulted primarily from the $28.1 million reversal of a
portion of our deferred income tax valuation allowance.  Net cash provided by operating activities for
the year ended December 31, 2005 was $62.6 million, resulting from net income
of $192.7 million, less non-cash items of $124.2 million, and $5.9 million of
changes in working capital.  The changes
in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2005, were primarily related
to an $8.3 million increase in accounts receivable offset by a $1.7 million
increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.  The increase in accounts receivable was
primarily due to an increase in revenues and timing of collections.  Non-cash items were primarily associated with
the deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization of intangible
assets.  The deferred income tax benefit
resulted primarily from the $171 million non-cash reversal of a portion of our
deferred tax valuation allowance.

Net cash provided by
investing activities was $68.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.  Investing activities were affected
by $64.9 million of net redemptions of short-term investments for the year
ended December 31, 2006.  Restricted cash
decreased by $19.9 million in 2006 as we are no longer required to
collateralize outstanding letters of credit with restricted cash balances.  Net cash used in investing activities was
approximately $94.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, due primarily
to the acquisition of Booking.com B.V. and purchases of property and equipment,
partially offset by net redemptions of short-term investments of $50.5
million.  Cash invested in purchases of
property and equipment was $12.9 million and $11.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately $157.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006.  The cash
provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was
primarily related to the issuance of $345 million of senior convertible notes
and $14.1 million of


proceeds
from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by $135.8 million of
treasury stock purchases, $9.1 million of debt issuance costs, $37.4 million
for the purchase of conversion spread hedges and the purchase of $19.8 million
of stock in priceline.com International held by minority interest
shareholders.  Net cash provided by
financing activities of $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
primarily proceeds from the sale of our minority interest in subsidiary and the
exercise of employee stock options.

As
more fully discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of
December 31, 2006, the total aggregate minority interest in priceline.com
International on a fully diluted basis was approximately 6.4%.  The
aggregate fair value of the remaining minority interest in priceline.com
International is estimated to be approximately $62.7 million at December 31, 2006, including unvested restricted stock
and restricted stock units.  We expect
the future fair value of the minority interest to grow based upon expected
continued strong performance of the European business.

On January 12, 2007, Delta
exercised warrants to purchase 756,199 shares of our common stock by
surrendering 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, representing all of the
remaining outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.


(3)

Assumes holders of minority
interests put their shares to us at the earliest possible date based upon the
estimated fair value at December 31, 2006 (see Note 17 for terms of put
provisions).

Priceline.com
leases office space in buildings in Norwalk, Connecticut; Cambridge England
(Booking.com Limited); and Amsterdam, Netherlands (Booking.com B.V.).  These leases are accounted for as operating
leases.  The operating lease obligations
represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 19 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

We
used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes and the
2013 Notes to purchase the Conversion Spread Hedges and to repurchase 3.85
million shares of our common stock at a cost of $129.6 million.  We used a portion of the net proceeds from
the issuance of the 1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of
Travelweb and Booking.com Limited in 2004, and in the acquisition of
Booking.com B.V. in July 2005.  The
remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses
and working capital requirements.

Excluded
from the table above are other long-term liabilities and letters of credit of
approximately $14.5 million that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and
landlords. The letters of credit expire between March 2007 and March 2008 and
are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of
credit.  Also excluded are employment
agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for cash
severance payments of approximately $15 million (which does not include the
estimated value of such benefits as continuation of medical or dental benefits
or the impact of excise tax gross-up).

Our
Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus
an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid, and is
subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007.  There were 13,470 shares of our Series B
Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31, 2006.  These shares were tendered as consideration
for the exercise price for warrants to purchase our common stock by Delta
Airlines, Inc. on January 12, 2007, and as a result, there are no longer any
shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding as of that date.

Our
outstanding senior convertible notes become convertible if certain specified
conditions are met; including if our stock price exceeds contingent conversion
levels for a specified conversion period (see Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).  Subsequent to
December 31, 2006, the closing price of our common stock has exceeded the
contingent conversion prices for our notes. 
 If the closing price exceeds the contingent conversion prices for
20 days in the specified 30 day conversion periods some or all of our convertible
notes would become convertible at the holder’s option requiring us to classify
the related outstanding debt balance as a current liability in our consolidated
balance sheet.  We believe it is highly
unlikely that a significant portion of the notes would be converted prior to
maturity because the market value of the notes exceeds the value that holders
would receive upon conversion.  However, if holders elect to convert, we
would likely fund the repayment with existing cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, common stock issuances and/ or additional borrowings.

We believe that our
existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our
operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at
least the next twelve months. However, if during that period or thereafter, we
are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in
raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms
acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures
and scale back the scope of our business plan, either of which could have a
material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of
operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity
securities, the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be
diluted.  There are no assurances that we
will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue
growth or sustained


profitability will
be realized or that future borrowings or equity sales will be available in
amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our
strategies or repay our indebtedness.

Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign
currency risk through internally established policies and procedures and, when
deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest risk and forward contracts
to manage foreign currency risk.

The objective of our policies is to mitigate potential income
statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from possible future
adverse fluctuations in rates. We evaluate our exposure to market risk by
assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign exchange rates. This evaluation includes the review of
leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and investment
bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the review of
market projections as to expected future rates. We utilize this information to
determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine if the use of
derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any potential future
market exposure that we may face. Our policy does not allow speculation in
derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument
contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial
instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged
derivatives.

We did
not experience any material changes in interest rate exposures during the year
ended December 31, 2006.  Based upon economic conditions and leading
market indicators at December 31, 2006, we do not foresee a significant adverse
change in interest rates in the near future.

As of
December 31, 2006, the carrying value of our debt is approximately $568.9
million.  We estimate that the fair
market value of such debt was approximately $692.3 million as of December 31,
2006.

As of December 31, 2006, we held an interest rate swap agreement on $45
million notional value of our fixed rate debt.  The fair value cost to
terminate this swap as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $1.2 million.  A 10% adverse fluctuation in the 3-month
LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2006, would increase the cost to terminate the
interest rate swap by approximately $293,000. 
Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the Company’s interest
rate sensitive derivative instrument would be substantially offset by a
corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying
debt.

As a result of the acquisitions of our European operations, we are
conducting a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United
States through subsidiaries with Euros and British pounds as their functional
currency.  As a result, we face exposure
to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our
European operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon
consolidation.  If the U.S. dollar
weakens against the local currency, the translation of these
foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net
revenues, operating expenses, and net income or loss.  Similarly, our net assets, net revenues,
operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the
U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. Additionally, foreign
exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our
Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
Our European operations are subject to risks typical of international
business, including, but not limited to, differing


economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax
structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate
volatility.

In
2006 and 2005, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize
the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated
operating results.  As of December 31,
2006, contracts with notional values of 17.6 million Euros were outstanding to
minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on our
consolidated operating results.  There
were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2005.  We may enter into additional forward
contracts or other economic hedges in the future.

Additionally, fixed rate investments are subject to unrealized gains
and losses due to interest rate volatility. 
To the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates
affect general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by
such changes.

Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The following Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company and the report of our independent
registered public accounting firm are filed as part of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K (See Item 15).

Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2006 and 2005; Consolidated Statements of
Operations, Changes in Stockholders’ Equity and Cash Flows for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

Item 9.  Changes
in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we conducted
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is
defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on
our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over
financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2006.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the


risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Controls.

No
change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2006 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In
July 2005, we acquired Booking.com B.V., and as a result of that acquisition,
we have undertaken a review of their internal controls and intend to make
changes, if necessary, that we believe to be appropriate to those internal
controls as we integrate its business with ours. In addition, in the second
quarter of 2006, we started to implement a new financial accounting system at
Booking.com B.V., which is expected to improve efficiency and support growth.
The implementation of this financial accounting system is expected to occur in
phases through 2007 and will likely affect the processes that constitute the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  As we further
integrate Booking.com B.V.’s business and continue with the system
implementation, we will continue to review its internal controls and may take
further steps to ensure that its internal controls are effective and integrated
appropriately.

Item 9B. Other Information

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

priceline.com Incorporated

Norwalk

,

Connecticut

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of priceline.com Incorporated and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2006.

We also have audited management’s assessment,
included in

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

set forth in
Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006

,

based
on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).

Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit of financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. 
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of the
inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected
on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of


the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Also in our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.  Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

As discussed in Note 2, effective January 1,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123(R),

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION

Priceline.com
Incorporated (“priceline.com,” or the “Company”) is a leading online travel
company that offers its customers a broad range of travel services, including
the opportunity to purchase airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation
packages, cruises and destination services. 
The Company’s unique

Name Your Own
Price

®

system — which allows its customers to make
offers for travel services at prices they set — enables its customers to use
the Internet to save money while enabling sellers, which include many of the
major domestic airline, hotel and rental car companies, to generate incremental
revenue.  The Company also offers its
customers the ability to purchase travel services in a more traditional,
price-disclosed manner.

2.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

— The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Travelweb LLC (“Travelweb”), and its 93.6%-owned subsidiary, priceline.com
International Ltd. (“priceline.com International”), which wholly owns
priceline.com Europe Holdings N. V. (“priceline.com Europe Holdings”),
Booking.com Limited (formerly known as Active Hotels Ltd.) and Booking.com B.V.
(formerly known as Bookings.com B.V.). 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates in which the Company
does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence,
are accounted for by the equity method.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and footnotes thereto.  Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

— The Company’s
financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred merchant
bookings, are carried at cost which approximates their fair value because of
the short-term nature of these financial instruments.  As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of
the Company’s outstanding 1.0%, 2.25%, 0.50% and 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes
was $150.6 million, $132.3 million, $203.7 million and $205.7 million,
respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The Company invests excess
cash primarily in money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and
short-term commercial paper. All highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

Short-Term Investments

— At December 31, 2006 and
2005, the Company had short-term investments of $8.0 million and $72.7 million,
respectively.  The short-term investments
primarily consist of commercial paper, corporate notes and U.S. Government
Agency Securities.  In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company has classified
these short-term investments as available-for-sale.  These securities are carried at estimated
fair market value with the aggregate unrealized gains and losses related to
these investments, net of taxes, reflected as a part of accumulated other
comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.


The
fair value of the investments is based on the specific quoted market price of
the securities at the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates.  Investments are considered to be impaired
when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.  Once a decline in fair value is determined to
be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis
in the investment is established. The marketable securities are presented as
current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as they are
available to meet the short-term working capital needs of the Company.

Restricted Cash

— Restricted cash at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 includes the amount held by the counterparty to the
interest rate hedge agreement in connection with the Company’s 1% Convertible
Senior Notes.  Restricted cash at
December 31, 2005 also collateralizes letters of credit issued in favor of
certain suppliers and landlords and included a deposit held by the Company’s
credit card processing company.  The
Company is not required to collateralize its letters of credit with restricted
cash balances as of December 31, 2006.

Property and Equipment

— Property and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter.

Goodwill

— The Company accounts for
acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition
at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price, including
related transaction costs, over the estimated fair values of the net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill.  The
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and results of operations reflect
an acquired business starting at the date of the acquisition.

Goodwill
is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or earlier if there is indication
of impairment, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS 142 also requires the Company to compare
the fair value of the acquired business to its carrying amount on an annual
basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value
of the acquired business is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its
carrying value. Fair values for acquired businesses are determined based on
discounted cash flows, market multiples or appraised values.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets

— The Company
reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition exceeds its carrying amount. The amount of
impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the
asset over the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount
rate commensurate with the risks involved.

Software Capitalization

— Certain direct development
costs associated with internal-use software are capitalized and include
external direct costs of services and payroll costs for employees devoting time
to the software projects principally related to software coding, designing
system interfaces and installation and testing of the software. These costs are
recorded as fixed assets and are amortized over a period not to exceed three
years beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Costs incurred
during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance and training
costs, are expensed as incurred.


Merchant Revenues and Cost of Merchant Revenues

Name Your Own Price

®

Services

:  Merchant revenues and related cost of
revenues are derived from transactions where priceline.com is the merchant of
record and, among other things, selects suppliers and determines the price it
will accept from the customer.  The
Company recognizes such revenues and costs if and when it fulfills the customer’s
non-refundable offer. Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include
the selling price and cost, respectively, of the travel services and are
reported on a gross basis.  In very
limited circumstances, priceline.com makes certain customer accommodations to
satisfy disputes and complaints.  The
Company accrues for such estimated losses and classifies the resulting expense
as adjustments to merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues or the
allowance for doubtful accounts, as appropriate.

Pursuant to the
terms of the Company’s hotel service, its hotel suppliers are permitted to bill
the Company for the underlying cost of the service during a specified period of
time.  In the event that the Company is
not billed by its hotel supplier within the specified time period, the Company
reduces its cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts.

Merchant Price-Disclosed Hotel Service

:  Merchant revenues for the Company’s

merchant
price-disclosed

hotel service are derived from transactions where
its customers purchase hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at disclosed rates
which are subject to contractual arrangements. 
Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are included
in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her stay.
Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay, subject
to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and accounts
payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the customer’s
stay at the hotel. The Company records the difference between the selling price
and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue.

Agency Revenues and Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where the
Company is not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold
are determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions,
customer processing fees and global distribution system (“GDS”) reservation
booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without any
associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized by the Company when
the customers complete their travel.

Advertising

-

Offline

— Advertising-offline expenses are comprised primarily of costs
of television, radio and newspaper advertising, agency fees, creative talent
and production cost for television and radio commercials.  The Company
expenses the production costs of advertising the first time the advertising
takes place.

Advertising

-

Online

—

Advertising-online expenses consist
primarily of keyword searches, affiliate programs, banners, pop-ups, and email
advertisements and are recognized as expense as the advertisements take place.

Sales and Marketing

— Sales and marketing
expenses are comprised primarily of credit card processing fees, fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate the Company’s call centers,
provisions for credit card charge-backs and provisions for uncollectible
commissions, all of which are expensed as incurred.

Personnel

—

Personnel expenses consist of compensation to the Company’s
personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health
insurance and stock based compensation. 
Included in accrued expenses were accrued compensation expenses of $14.3
million and $5.6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


Information Technology

— Information technology
expenses are comprised primarily of system maintenance and software license
fees, data communications and other expenses associated with operating the
Company’s Internet sites and payments to outside contractors. Such costs are
expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

— In December 2004, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123(R)”)
was issued. SFAS 123(R) is a revision of SFAS No. 123, as amended, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation (“SFAS 123”). SFAS 123(R) eliminated the
alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided
in SFAS 123, which generally resulted in no compensation expense recorded in
the financial statements related to the issuance of stock options. SFAS 123(R)
requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be
recognized in financial statements. SFAS 123(R) established fair value as the
measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and
requires companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting
for share-based payment transactions with employees.  Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company
accounted for stock awards and stock option grants using the intrinsic value method.
Compensation expense relating to restricted stock and restricted stock unit
grants was recognized over the period during which the employee rendered
service to the Company necessary to earn the award, at fair value on date of
grant.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R) using the
modified prospective method. Under this transition method, compensation cost
recognized in the year ended December 31, 2006, includes amounts of: (a)
compensation cost of all share-based awards granted to employees prior to, but
unvested as of, January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated
in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, net of estimated
forfeitures, and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted subsequent
to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the new provisions of SFAS 123(R). In accordance with the modified
prospective method, results for prior periods have not been restated.   The Company determined the excess tax
benefits available as of the adoption date for use in offsetting future tax
shortfalls using the alternative transition method of FASB Staff Position
123(R)-3.

The fair value of restricted stock, performance shares and restricted
stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted
price of the Company’s common stock as of the grant date.  The fair value of stock options is determined
as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such value is
recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures,
using the straight line method under SFAS 123(R).

The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in an increase in net earnings
attributable to the cumulative effect of accounting change caused by SFAS
123(R)’s requirement to apply an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested
awards.  The Company previously recorded
forfeitures when they occurred. The cumulative effect of accounting change as
of January 1, 2006 totaled approximately $211,000 ($131,000 net of related tax
effect) and was recorded in personnel expense for the year ended December 31,
2006 since its impact on net income and net income per share was not
significant.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), deferred compensation related to
restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards was classified as a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS
123(R), on January 1, 2006, the balance in deferred compensation was
reclassified to additional paid-in capital.


SFAS 123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, requiring
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be
reported as financing cash flows, rather than as operating cash flows as
previously required, but only when such excess tax benefits are realized.

If the intrinsic value method was utilized in 2006, operating income,
earnings before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of investees and
minority interests, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share would
have increased by $3.5 million, $3.5 million, $2.2 million, $0.06 and $0.05,
respectively, principally for the impact of stock options issued prior to
December 31, 2005.

No stock options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2006.
The fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, assuming no dividends and the following weighted average
assumptions:

Risk-free
  interest rate

%

3.2

%

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of
the option.  The expected lives represent
the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the Company’s
historical exercise pattern.  The
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common
stock.

The following table provides relevant information as to reported
results for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 under the Company’s
intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options with supplemental pro
forma information as if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 had
been applied (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Income Taxes

— The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,”
which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary difference between
the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently
enacted tax rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

Segment Reporting

— The Company operates and
manages its business as a single operating segment.  For geographic related information, see Note
21 to these Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Currency Translation

— The functional currency of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency.  Assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing at the balance sheet date.  Income statement amounts are translated at
the average exchange rates for the period. 
Translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  Foreign currency transaction
gains and (losses) are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations,
principally in other income (expense), and amounted to $0.8 million, ($0.7
million) and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

— The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance
sheet at fair value.  The Company uses
derivative instruments principally in the management of interest rate and
foreign currency exposure. On the date on which the Company enters into a
derivative transaction, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the
identified exposure. The Company formally documents all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the
Company specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment,
forecasted transaction, or net investment that has been designated as the
hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the
risks related to the hedged item. The Company measures effectiveness of its
hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.  The Company’s derivative instruments do not
contain leverage features. Gains and losses on a derivative designated as a
cash flow hedge are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). Gains and losses on a derivative designated as a fair value
hedge are offset by the loss or gain of the hedged item.   Hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the
statement of operations as incurred.

From
time to time, the Company enters into forward contracts with counterparties
pursuant to which future foreign exchange rates for expected future earnings
are fixed.  Realized and unrealized gains
and losses resulting from the forward contracts are recognized in the period in
which they occur.  As of December 31,
2006, contracts with notional values of 17.6 million Euros were outstanding to
minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency fluctuations on consolidated
operating results.  Foreign


exchange gains (losses) from forward contracts in the amount of ($1.5
million), $0.3 million and $0 were recorded in other income (expense) for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

3.

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

On July 14, 2005, the Company,
through its subsidiary, priceline.com International Limited (“priceline.com
International”), acquired 100% of the total issued share capital of Booking.com
B.V. (formerly known as Bookings.com B.V.), an Amsterdam-based provider of
online services for the booking of European hotel reservations.  The total
consideration for all of the Booking.com B.V. shares was approximately $135
million, including direct acquisition costs and certain post-closing
adjustments. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business
combination. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the
results of operations of Booking.com B.V. since its acquisition in July 2005.

4.             STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

The Company has adopted the following stock compensation
plans from which broad-based employee grants may be made:  the
priceline.com Incorporated 1997 Omnibus Plan (the “1997 Plan”), the
priceline.com Incorporated 1999 Omnibus Plan (the “1999 Plan”) and the
priceline.com Incorporated 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”),
each of which provides for grants of share-based compensation as incentives and
rewards to encourage employees, officers, consultants and directors in the
long-term success of the Company.  The
1997 Plan, 1999 Plan and 2000 Plan provide for grants of share-based
compensation to purchase up to 3,979,166, 7,895,833 and 1,000,000 shares of
priceline.com common stock, respectively, at a purchase price equal to the fair
market value on the date of grant.

Stock-based compensation issued under the plans generally consists of
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, performance shares and
restricted stock units.  Stock options
are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of
the common stock at the date of grant and have a term of 10 years.  Generally, stock option grants to employees
vest over three years from the grant date. 
Restricted stock, performance shares and restricted stock units
generally vest over periods from 1 to 4 years. 
The Company issues new shares of common stock upon the issuance of
restricted stock, the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted
stock units and performance shares.

In addition, the Company has granted restricted stock and restricted
stock units in shares of priceline.com International to certain managers of its
European operations.  These awards
generally vest over two to three years.

Stock-based compensation cost was approximately $14.9 million, $4.2
million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  The related tax benefit
was $5.4 million $1.5 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.  Included in
the above amounts are stock-based compensation and related tax benefit for
restricted stock and restricted stock units related to shares of priceline.com
International (“PIL Share-Based Awards”).

with an aggregate grant-date fair value of approximately $8.8 million and $0.3
million, respectively.  During the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, 26,833 and 20,833 shares of restricted
stock vested with a total grant date fair value of $585,000 and $422,000.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $14.9 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested Share-Based Awards to be recognized over
a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.


The unvested Share-Based Awards at December 31, 2006 include 164,095
shares underlying a broad-based grant of performance shares to certain
employees in February and June 2006, net of actual forfeitures, with a weighted
average grant date fair value of approximately $25.39 per share.  The
164,095 represents the target number of shares of priceline.com common stock
that will be issued to employees if the Company achieves certain financial
performance versus a peer group of companies.  The actual number of
performance shares issued will be determined at the end of the performance
period in 2009, assuming there is no accelerated vesting for, among other
things, a change in control, and could range from zero to an additional 328,190
shares over the target number of shares if the maximum performance threshold
associated with the performance shares is met by the Company.  Stock-based
compensation related to the performance shares is recorded based upon the
estimated probable outcome at the end of the performance period.  During the year ended December 31, 2006, the
estimated probable number of shares to be issued at the end of the performance
period was increased by 328,190 shares.

Unvested shares at December 31, 2006 also include 79,591 restricted
stock units with a weighted average grant date fair value of approximately
$23.85 per share.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had a restructuring liability of $1.3
million for the estimated remaining costs related to leased property vacated by
the Company in 2000. During the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a

disposal costs related to the vacated leased property.  The Company estimates that, based on current
available information, the remaining net cash outflows associated with its
restructuring related


commitments
will be paid in 2007-2011. The current portion of the restructuring accrual in

8.             NET
INCOME PER SHARE

The Company
computes basic and diluted net income per share in accordance with SFAS
No. 128,

“Earnings per Share.”
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted net income
per share is based upon the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding during the year.

Common
equivalent shares related to stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, performance shares and warrants are calculated using the treasury stock
method.   Performance shares are included in weighted average common
equivalent shares based on the number of shares that would be issuable if the
end of the reporting period were the end of the performance period, if the
result would be dilutive.

The
Company’s 2006 1% Notes, 2006 2.25% Notes, 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes

have net share settlement
features requiring the Company to settle the principal amount of the debt for
cash upon conversion and cash or shares of the Company’s common stock

for the conversion premium (See Note 13). Pursuant to EITF
90-19, “Convertible Bonds with Issuer Options to Settle for Cash Upon
Conversion” the convertible notes are included in the calculation of diluted
net income per share if their inclusion is dilutive under the treasury

stock method.

There are approximately 14.3 million shares that could be
issued under these convertible notes if the Company experiences substantial
increases in its common stock price.  Under the treasury stock
method, the convertible notes will generally have a dilutive impact on net
income per share if the Company’s average stock price for the period exceeds
the conversion price for the convertible notes. As an example, at stock prices
of $40 per share, $60 per share and $100 per share, common equivalent shares
would include approximately 0.1 million, 4.8 million and 8.6 million equivalent
shares, respectively, related to the convertible notes (excluding the
offsetting impact of the Convertible Spread Hedges).  No common share equivalents were included in
the calculation of diluted net income per share for these convertible notes for
the year ended December 31, 2006 because the average stock price for the year
did not exceed the conversion price for the convertible notes.

The Conversion Spread Hedges issued by the Company increase
the effective conversion price of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes from $40.38
to $50.47 per share from the Company’s perspective and are expected to reduce
the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the 2013
Notes.  Since the impact of the
Conversion Spread Hedges is anti-dilutive it is excluded from the calculation
of net income per share until they are exercised upon maturity.

Prior to the Debt
Exchange Offer (see Note 13), the Company’s 1% Notes and 2.25% Notes were
convertible into a fixed amount of common stock if certain specified conditions
were met.  Pursuant to EITF 04-08 “Effect
of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share”, these
convertible notes were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per
share if their inclusion was dilutive to earnings per share under the “if-converted”
method.  Common share equivalents of 5.0
million shares, 5.8 million shares and 3.1 million shares related to these
convertible notes were included in the calculation of diluted net income per
share for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Interest expense related to the convertible
notes in the amount of $2.7 million, $3.0 million and $2.1 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, was also added back
to net income in the  calculation of
diluted net income per share.  The
warrants underlying Series B Preferred Stock are also considered for inclusion
in fully diluted net income per share using the “if-converted” method.

outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share is as follows (in

Investment in
pricelinemortgage.com represents the Company’s 49% equity investment in
pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, the Company recognizes its pro rata
share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed an amount
that the Company believes represents the investment’s estimated fair value. The
Company recognized approximately $80,000 representing its pro rata share of
pricelinemortgage.com’s operating loss for the year ended December 31,
2006.  For the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company recognized approximately $1.3 million and $8,000,
respectively, of income from its investment in pricelinemortgage.com.  The Company earned advertising fees from
pricelinemortgage.com of approximately $22,000, $53,000 and $100,000 in the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Based upon recent operating results and
future projected results for pricelinemortgage.com, the Company determined that
its investment was impaired on an other-than-temporary basis.  Accordingly, in the third quarter 2006, the
Company recorded a charge of $1.1 million to reduce the carrying value of its
equity investment in pricelinemortgage.com to its estimated fair value.

In February 2005, the
Company invested $1.0 million in an online advertising company (the “Investee”),
representing approximately 20% of that company’s outstanding equity. The
investment was accounted for under the cost method.  An additional $1.2 million was invested in
January 2006, increasing the Company’s ownership to approximately 42% of the
outstanding equity and, accordingly, the Company began accounting for its
investment under the equity method of accounting.  In June 2006,


the Company purchased the
remaining equity for an additional $2.0 million.  The acquisition has been accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting.  The
acquired company is included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company since the date of acquisition. 
Assets acquired totaled $1.6 million and consisted principally of
internally developed software and accounts receivable, while liabilities
assumed totaled $0.1 million.  Goodwill
resulting from this acquisition amounted to approximately $2.6 million.  The Company recognized approximately $219,000
of net loss from its pro rata share of the Investee’s operating results from
January to June 2006.  Online advertising
fees paid to the Investee prior to acquiring the remaining ownership interest
in June 2006 were $435,000 and were $1.1 million for the year ended December
31, 2005.

Deferred debt issuance costs
arose from the Company’s issuance of $125 million aggregate principal amount of
1% Notes in August 2003, $100 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Notes
in June 2004, $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.5% Notes in
September 2006 and $172.5 million of aggregate principal amount 0.75% Notes in
September 2006.  Deferred debt issuance
costs of approximately $4.5 million, $3.6 million, $4.4 million and $4.4
million, respectively, consisting primarily of underwriting commissions and
professional service fees, are being amortized using the effective interest
rate method over approximately five years, except for the 0.75% Notes, which
are amortized over seven years.

13.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

In September 2006, the
Company issued, in a private placement, $150 million aggregate principal amount
of Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2011, with an interest rate of
0.50% (the “2011 Notes”), and $150 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due September 30, 2013, with an interest rate of 0.75%
(the “2013 Notes”).  Each $1,000
principal amount of 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes will initially be convertible
into 24.7647 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.008 per share
at a conversion price of approximately $40.38 per share, subject to
adjustment.   The 2011 Notes and the 2013
Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, prior to June 30, 2011 in
the case of the 2011 Notes, and prior to June 30, 2013 in the case of the 2013
Notes, upon the occurrence of specified events, including, but not limited to a
change in control, or if after the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2006,
the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading
days in the period of the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 120% of
the applicable conversion price in effect for the notes on the last trading day
of the immediately preceding quarter.  In
the event that all or substantially all of the Company’s common stock is acquired
on or prior to the maturity of the 2011 Notes or the 2013 Notes, in a
transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the Company’s common
stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company would be required
to make additional payments in the form of additional shares of common stock to
the holders of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes, collectively, in aggregate
value ranging from $0 to approximately $57.5 million depending upon the date of
the transaction and the then current stock price of the Company. In October
2006, the initial purchasers exercised their over-allotment option to purchase
an additional $22.5 million of 2011 Notes and $22.5 million of 2013
Notes, solely to cover over-allotments.

On and after June 30, 2011,
with respect to the 2011 Notes, and on and after June 30, 2013, with respect to
the 2013 Notes, holders shall have the right to convert all or any portion of
such security at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled
trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of any
conditions in place prior to those dates. 
Upon conversion, a holder will receive cash for the principal amount of
the note and cash or shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of
cash and shares of the Company’s common stock for conversion value in excess of
such principal amount.


Neither the 2011 Notes nor
the 2013 Notes may be redeemed by the Company prior to maturity.  The holders may require the Company to
repurchase the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes for cash in certain
circumstances.  Interest on the 2011
Notes and the 2013 Notes is payable on March 30 and September 30 of each year,
starting March 30, 2007.

In September 2006, the
Company entered into hedge transactions relating to potential dilution of the
Company’s common stock upon conversion of 
the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes (the “Conversion Spread Hedges”) with
affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes (the “counterparties”).  Under the Conversion Spread Hedges, the
Company is entitled to purchase from the counterparties approximately 7.4
million shares of the Company’s common stock (the number of shares underlying
the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes) at a strike price of $40.38 per share
(subject to adjustment in certain circumstances) and the counterparties are
entitled to purchase from the Company approximately 7.4 million shares of the
Company’s common stock at a strike price of $50.47 per share (subject to
adjustment in certain circumstances).   The Conversion Spread Hedges
increase the effective conversion price of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes to
$50.47 per share from the Company’s perspective and are expected to reduce the
potential dilution upon conversion of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes.  If the market value per share of the Company’s
common stock at the time of any exercise is above $40.38, the Conversion Spread
Hedge will entitle the Company to receive from the counterparties net shares of
the Company’s common stock based on the excess of the then current market price
of the Company’s common stock over the strike price of the purchased call
options.  Holders of the 2011 Notes and
the 2013 Notes do not have any rights with respect to the Conversion Spread
Hedges.  The Conversion Spread Hedges are
separate transactions entered into by the Company with the counterparties, are
not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders’ rights
under the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes. 
The Conversion Spread Hedges are exercisable at dates coinciding with
the scheduled maturities of the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes.  In October 2006, the Company amended the
Conversion Spread Hedges to increase the number of notional shares in the
underlying agreements by approximately 1.1 million shares.  The amendment to the Conversion Spread Hedges
was entered into with respect to the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes sold in
connection with the exercise of the initial purchasers’ over-allotment right,
as described above.

The Company analyzed the
Conversion Spread Hedges under Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No.
00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and
Potentially Settled In, a Company’s Own Stock,” and EITF 01-6, “The Meaning of
Indexed to a Company’s Own Stock” and determined that they meet the criteria
for classification as equity transactions. As a result, in the year ended
December 31, 2006, the Company recorded the $37.4 million paid to purchase
Conversion Spread Hedges as a reduction in additional paid-in capital and the
Company will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the agreements.

In June 2004, the Company
issued, in a private placement, $100 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025, with an interest rate of 2.25%
(the “2.25% Notes”).  The 2.25% Notes are
convertible, subject to certain conditions, into the Company’s common stock,
par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price
of approximately $37.95 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of 2.25% Notes will initially be convertible into 26.3505 shares of the
Company’s common stock if, on or prior to January 15, 2020, the closing sale
price of our common stock for at least 20 consecutive trading days in the
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the first day of a conversion
period is more than 120% of the then current conversion price of the 2.25%
Notes.  The 2.25% Notes are also convertible
in certain other circumstances, such as a change in control of the
Company.  In the event that all or
substantially all of the Company’s common stock is acquired on or prior to
January 15, 2010, in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders
of the Company’s common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the
Company would be required to make additional payments in the form of


common shares to the holders
of the 2.25% Notes of amounts ranging from $0 to $16.0 million depending upon
the date of the transaction and the then current stock price of the
Company.  In addition, the 2.25% Notes
will be redeemable at the Company’s option beginning January 20, 2010, and the
holders may require the Company to repurchase the 2.25% Notes on January 15,
2010, 2015 or 2020, or in certain other circumstances.  Interest on the 2.25% Notes is payable on
January 15 and July 15 of each year.

In August 2003, the Company
issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of 1% (the “1%
Notes”).  The 1% Notes are convertible,
subject to certain conditions, into the Company’s common stock, par value
$0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of
approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of 1% Notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of the Company’s
common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing price of the
Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period is more than 110%
of the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes, or after August 1, 2008,
if the closing price of the Company’s common stock is more than 110% of the
then current conversion price of the 1% Notes. 
The 1% Notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances, such
as a change in control of the Company. 
In addition, the 1% Notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option
beginning in 2008, and the holders may require the Company to repurchase the 1%
Notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances.  Interest on the 1% Notes is payable on
February 1 and August 1 of each year.

In November 2003, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby it swapped the
fixed 1% interest on its 1% Notes for a floating interest rate based on the
3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of 221 basis points, on
$45 million notional value of debt.  This
agreement expires August 1, 2010.  The
Company designated this interest rate swap agreement as a fair value
hedge.  The changes in the fair value of
the interest rate swap agreement and the underlying debt are recorded as
offsetting gains and losses in interest expense in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations.  Hedge ineffectiveness is
not significant in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.  The fair value cost to terminate this swap as
of December 31, 2006 and 2005, was approximately $1.2 million and $1.5 million,
respectively, and has been recorded as a credit in other long-term liabilities
with a related adjustment to the carrying value of debt.

The Company used a portion
of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes to
purchase the Conversion Spread Hedges and to repurchase 3.85 million shares of
its common stock at a cost of $129.6 million. 
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the
1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of Travelweb and Booking.com
Limited in 2004, and in the acquisition of Booking.com B.V. in July 2005.  The remaining proceeds are available for
general corporate purposes, strategic uses and working capital requirements.

On November 10, 2006, the Company completed an exchange offer
(the “Debt Exchange Offer”) for substantially all of its existing 1% Notes and
all of its existing 2.25% Notes, whereby the Company exchanged $1,000 principal
amount of new 2006 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010 for each $1,000
principal amount of the existing 1% Notes, and $1,000 principal amount of new
2006 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 for each $1,000 principal amount
of the existing 2.25% Notes. The new notes are substantially the same as the
prior notes except that the new notes have a net share settlement feature
requiring the Company to settle the principal amount of the debt for cash upon
conversion and cash or shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of
cash and shares of the Company’s common stock for the conversion premium.  The new 2006 2.25% Notes provide for a 0.35%
premium to exchange and the new 2006 1% Notes provide for a make whole premium
payable in certain circumstances upon conversions occurring as a result of a
change in control. In the event that all or


substantially
all of the Company’s common stock is acquired on or prior to August 1, 2008, in
a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the Company’s
common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company would be
required to make additional payments in the form of additional shares of common
stock to the holders of the new 1% Notes in aggregate value ranging from $0 to
approximately $18.9 million depending upon the date of the transaction and the
then current stock price of the Company.

14.          TREASURY STOCK

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock from time to time
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  Under this program, the Company repurchased
237,857 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $5.7 million in the
first half of 2006, at prevailing market prices.

During
the third quarter 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $150 million of the Company’s common stock with a portion
of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes (see
Note 13).  In September 2006, the Company
purchased 3.85 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $129.6 million. 
Additional repurchases of 18,867 shares were made in the second half of
2006 to satisfy withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation at
prevailing market prices at an aggregate cost of approximately $608,000.

The
Company may make additional repurchases of shares under its stock repurchase
program, depending on prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital
and other factors.  Whether and when to
initiate and/or complete any purchase of common stock and the amount of common
stock purchased will be determined in the Company’s complete discretion.  As of December 31, 2006, there were
approximately 6.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock held in
treasury.

15.          REDEEMABLE PREFERRED
STOCK

In
2001, the Company issued Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) 80,000 shares of
Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Series B
Preferred Stock”) and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase approximately 4.5
million shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $17.81 per
share.  The exercise price of the
Warrants is paid by surrendering .0178125 shares of Series B Preferred Stock
for each share of the Company’s common stock purchased.

The
Series B Preferred Stock was subject to mandatory redemption on February 6,
2007.  The Series B Preferred Stock
accrued dividends payable in shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate of
11% per annum commencing February 6, 2001. Dividends on the Series B Preferred
Stock were payable semi­annually on February 6 and August 6 of each year
starting August 6, 2001.

During
2001, Delta exercised Warrants to purchase approximately 3.1 million shares of
the Company’s common stock and on January 29, 2002, Delta exercised Warrants to
purchase 666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result, there were
13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding with an aggregate
liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million and the Company’s future
semi-annual dividend requirement was 40,240 shares of common stock.  In accordance with the terms of the Series B
Preferred Stock, the Company delivered to Delta the required shares of the
Company’s common stock as dividend payments. The Company recorded non-cash
dividends of approximately $1.9 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.


On
January 12, 2007, Delta exercised warrants to purchase 756,199 shares of the
Company’s common stock by surrendering 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock, representing all of the remaining outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock.  On February 6, 2007,
the Company issued a final pro-rated dividend to Delta in the amount of 34,874
shares of common stock.

16.          OTHER WARRANTS TO
PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

Delta
also held warrants to purchase 779,166 shares of the Company’s common stock at
an exercise price of $28.31 per share. 
These warrants became exercisable in November 2004 and expired
unexercised in 2005.

17.          MINORITY INTERESTS

In connection with the Company’s acquisitions of Booking.com B.V. in
July 2005 and Booking.com Limited in September 2004 and the reorganization of
its European operations, key managers of Booking.com B.V. and Booking.com
Limited purchased shares of priceline.com International.  In addition, these key managers were granted
restricted stock and restricted stock units in priceline.com International
shares that vest over time.  As of December 31, 2006, the total aggregate
minority interest in priceline.com International on a fully diluted basis was
approximately 6.4%.

The holders of the minority interest in priceline.com International
have the right to put their shares to the Company and the Company has the right
to call their shares at a purchase price reflecting the fair market value of
the shares at the time of the exercise of the put or call right.  Subject
to certain exceptions, (a) certain of the shares are subject to the put and
call options in March 2007 and 2008 and (b) certain of the shares are subject
to the put and call options in August 2007 and 2008.  In April 2006, the
Company repurchased shares underlying minority interest with a carrying value
of $1.2 million for an aggregate purchase price of $1.6 million based upon fair
value.  The excess of the purchase price over the carrying value is
recorded as goodwill.  In September 2006, the Company repurchased shares
underlying minority interest with a carrying value of $6.7 million for an
aggregate purchase price of $18.2 million based upon fair value.  The
excess of the purchase price over the carrying value is recorded as an increase
of intangible assets, deferred taxes and goodwill.

All purchased securities and vested granted securities described above
can be put by the holders of the securities or called by the Company shortly
after the consummation of a “change in control” of the Company.  The
aggregate fair value of the remaining minority interest in priceline.com
International is estimated to be approximately $62.7 million at December 31,
2006, including unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units.

18.          TAXES

Domestic pre-tax income was $27.6 million, $31.3 million and $38.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  Foreign pre-tax income
(loss) was $34.5 million, $5.1 million and ($7.6 million) for the years ended

The Company has
recorded a deferred tax liability in the amount of $39.7 million and $42.4
million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily related to the
assignment of estimated fair value to certain purchased identifiable intangible
assets associated with the acquisitions of Booking.com Limited and Booking.com
B.V.  An income tax benefit in the amount
of $3.0 million was recorded in 2006 resulting from the impact on deferred
taxes of a reduction in the Netherlands’ statutory tax rate from 29.6% to 25.5%
effective January 1, 2007.  At December
31, 2006, no provision had been made for U.S. taxes on approximately $68.8
million of foreign earnings, which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.

The Company has significant deferred tax
assets, resulting principally from U.S. net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”). 
As required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” the Company
periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax
assets, and reduces the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance to the extent it believes a portion will not be realized.
The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future
realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative
earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable
income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes, and
other relevant factors. Through June 30, 2005, the Company provided a valuation
allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset.  Management
concluded in the third quarter 2005, based upon its assessment of positive and
negative evidence, that it is more likely than not that a portion of the
deferred tax assets will be realized.  Accordingly, the Company recorded a
non-cash tax benefit in the third quarter 2005, resulting from a $170.5 million
reversal of a portion of its valuation allowance on its deferred tax
assets.  In the third quarter of 2006, management concluded that based
upon current operating results, projected future results, the potential
accretive effect of the convertible note offering (see note 13) and revisions
to the carryforward periods for certain state net operating losses, it is more
likely than not that additional deferred tax assets will be realized. 
Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash tax benefit and an increase to
additional paid-in capital in the third quarter

2006,
of $28.1 million and $15.6 million, respectively, resulting from an additional
$43.7 million reversal of a portion of its valuation allowance on its deferred
tax assets.  It is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax
assets will not be realized and, accordingly, a valuation allowance remains
against those assets.  The valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in
the future if facts and circumstances change, causing a reassessment of the
amount of deferred tax assets more likely than not to be realized.  The deferred tax asset at December 31, 2006
and 2005 amounted to $191.7 million and $158.7 million, respectively.  The current portion at December 31, 2006 and
2005 amounting to $12.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively, is recorded in
prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For the year ended
December 31, 2006, the valuation allowance decreased by approximately $38
million resulting from the aforementioned recognition of certain deferred tax
assets.  The valuation allowance
decreased by approximately $351 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
resulting from the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and the write-off
of certain deferred tax assets related to expiring state NOLs and capital loss
carryforwards for which a corresponding valuation allowance had been recorded.

At December 31, 2006, the
Company had approximately $3.0 billion of net operating loss carryforwards for
income tax purposes expiring from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2021 which
are subject to limitation on future utilization under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Section
382 imposes limitations on the availability of a company’s net operating losses
after a more than 50 percentage point ownership change occurs.  The Section 382 limitation is based upon
certain conclusions pertaining to the dates of ownership changes and the value
of the Company on the dates of the ownership changes.  As a result of a study, it was determined
that ownership changes, as defined in Section 382, occurred in 2000 and
2002.  The amount of the Company’s net
operating losses incurred prior to each ownership change is limited based on
the value of the Company on the respective dates of ownership change.  It is


estimated that the
effect of Section 382 will generally limit the total cumulative amount of net
operating loss available to offset future taxable income to approximately $1.6 billion.
Pursuant to Section 382, subsequent ownership changes could further limit
this amount.

At December 31, 2006, the
Company had approximately $5 million of U.S. capital loss carryforwards, which
expire December 31, 2007.  At December
31, 2006, the Company also had approximately $1.4 million of U.S. research
credit carryforwards.  Such credit
carryforwards expire from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.  These U.S. capital loss and U.S. research credit
carryforwards are also subject to annual limitation.

Approximately
$785 million of the Company’s tax net operating losses at December 31, 2006
relate to the exercise of stock options which have been granted under the
Company’s various stock option plans and give rise to compensation which has
been included in the taxable income of the applicable current and former
employees and deducted by the Company for federal and state income tax
purposes.  Additionally, approximately
$1.06 billion of the Company’s tax net operating losses relate to the excess of
tax deductions from the exercise of certain stock warrants granted by the
Company in excess of the associated warrant costs recorded for financial
accounting purposes. Finally, the Company recorded $6.8 million of costs for
financial reporting purposes in excess of the amount deductible for tax
purposes related to the vesting of restricted stock held by certain employees
of the Company.

Litigation
Related to Hotel Occupancy and Other Taxes

Statewide
Putative Class Actions

A number of cities and counties have filed putative class actions on
behalf of themselves and other allegedly similarly situated cities and counties
within the same respective state against the Company and other defendants,
including, but not in all cases, Lowestfare.com Incorporated and Travelweb LLC,
both of which are subsidiaries of the Company, and Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.com
GP, LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Travelport, Inc. (f/k/a Cendant
Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.); Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork
Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com); Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.;
Orbitz, LLC; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; and
Travelnow.com, Inc.  Each complaint
alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated each jurisdiction’s
respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charges and
remittance of amounts to cover taxes under each ordinance.  Each complaint typically seeks compensatory
damages, disgorgement, penalties available by law, attorneys’ fees and other
relief.  Such actions include:

City of Los Angeles v. Hotels.com, Inc., et al.

:  On
December 30, 2004, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior
Court for the County of Los Angeles by the City of Los Angeles on behalf of
itself and an alleged class of California cities, counties and other
municipalities that have enacted occupancy taxes.  In addition to the tax claims, the complaint
also asserts unfair competition claims under California Business and
Professions Code § 17200,

et seq.

(“Section
17200”).  On May 19, 2005, the court
ordered limited discovery.  On August 31,
2005, the City of Los Angeles filed an amended complaint adding a claim for a
declaratory judgment.  On September 26, 2005,
the court sustained the defendants’ demurrers on grounds of improper joinder of
defendants and claims, and therefore, dismissed the amended complaint, with
leave to file a second amended complaint. 
On February 8, 2006, the City of Los Angeles filed a second amended
complaint that asserts the same claims but includes additional allegations of
fact.  On March 27, 2006, at the
direction of the court, the defendants filed renewed demurrers to the second
amended complaint on grounds of improper joinder of defendants and claims.  Those demurrers have been fully briefed.  On March 31, 2006, the defendants filed a
petition to coordinate this matter with the

City of San Diego

case (discussed below).  On July 12,
2006, that petition was granted, and, as a result, this case and the

City of San Diego

case will now proceed in the Superior Court
of Los Angeles.  The City of Los Angeles
informed the court that it will submit on


February
21, 2007 a proposed further amended complaint. On March 1, 2007, the court is
scheduled to conduct oral argument on Defendants’ demurrers on grounds of
improper joinder of defendants and claims, and, if necessary, it will hear the
parties’ positions on whether and how to proceed with the City of Los Angeles’
proposed third amended complaint.

City of Fairview Heights v. Orbitz, Inc., et al.

:  On
October 5, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Circuit
Court, Twentieth Judicial Circuit, St. Clair County, Illinois, by the City of
Fairview Heights on behalf of itself and a putative class of Illinois taxing
authorities that are allegedly authorized to impose a tax on the business of
renting hotel rooms.  In addition to the
tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for violation of the Illinois
Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Practices Act, 815 ILCS 505/1, similar laws in
other states, conversion and unjust enrichment. 
On November 28, 2005, the Company and certain other defendants removed
this action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Illinois.  On January 17, 2006, the
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. 
On February 10, 2006, the City of Fairview Heights moved to remand this
action to state court.  On July 12, 2006,
the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss all claims other than the tax
claim, denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the tax claim, and denied plaintiff’s
motion to remand.  The parties are
currently conducting discovery.

City of Findlay v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On
October 25, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Common
Pleas Court of Hancock County, Ohio by the City of Findlay on behalf of itself
and a putative class of Ohio cities, counties and townships that have enacted
occupancy or excise taxes on lodging.  In
addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for violation of
the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1345,

et seq

., conversion, a constructive trust and a declaratory
judgment.  On November 22, 2005, the
Company and certain other defendants removed this action to the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  On January 30, 2006, the defendants moved to
dismiss the complaint.  On July 26, 2006,
the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the Consumer Sales Practices
Act claims and denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the remaining claims.  The parties are currently conducting merits
discovery.

City of Rome, Georgia, et al., v. Hotels.com, L.P., et al.

:  On
November 18, 2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by the City of Rome,
Hart County and the City of Cartersville on behalf of themselves and a putative
class of Georgia cities, counties and governments which have enacted transient
occupancy taxes and/or excise taxes on lodging. 
In addition to the tax claims, the complaint also asserts claims for
violation of Georgia’s Uniform Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,
conversion, unjust enrichment, a constructive trust and a declaratory
judgment.  On February 6, 2006, the
Company and certain other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint.  On May 8, 2006, the court granted defendants’
motion to dismiss all claims relating to the Georgia sales and use tax and
denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the excise tax claims.  The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on
June 7, 2006 naming additional plaintiffs. 
The parties are currently conducting discovery regarding class
certification issues.  On February 9,
2007, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims for

was coordinated with the

City of Los Angeles

action and will proceed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles.  Limited discovery has been provided to the
City of San Diego consistent with that provided to the City of Los
Angeles.  The City of San Diego informed

jurisdiction because the City of Atlanta failed to exhaust mandatory
administrative remedies prior to bringing suit. 
On January 10, 2007, the City of Atlanta filed a notice of appeal to the
court’s order deciding it lacked jurisdiction. 
In addition, the City of Atlanta has indicated its intention to commence

et seq

.,

Litigation Related to Securities Matters

On March 16, March 26, April
27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four putative class action complaints were
filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York naming
priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.,
BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as
defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ. 3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et
al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other defendants and states
claims unrelated to the Company.  The
complaints allege, among other things, that priceline.com and the individual
defendants violated the federal securities laws by issuing and selling
priceline.com common stock in priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public
offering without disclosing to investors that some of the underwriters in the
offering, including the lead underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received
excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors.  By Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge
Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these cases were consolidated for pre-trial
purposes with hundreds of other cases, which contain allegations concerning the
allocation of shares in the initial public offerings of companies other than
priceline.com, Inc.  By Order of Judge
Scheindlin dated August 14, 2001, the following cases were consolidated for all
purposes:  01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576;
and 01 Civ. 3590.  On April 19, 2002,
plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these
cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class
Action Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with
respect to both the Company’s March 1999 initial public offering and the
Company’s August 1999 second public offering of common stock.  The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc.,
Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman,
Timothy G. Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs &
Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc.
(as successor-in-interest to BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as
successor-in-interest to Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.),
Allen & Co., Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  Priceline, Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul
Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier, together with other issuer
defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a joint motion to dismiss on
July 15, 2002.  On November 18, 2002, the
cases against the individual defendants were dismissed without prejudice and
without costs.  In addition, counsel for
plaintiffs and the individual defendants executed Reservation of Rights and Tolling
Agreements, which toll the statutes of limitations on plaintiffs’ claims
against those individuals.  On February
19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and
denying in part the issuer’s motion. 
None of the claims against the Company were dismissed.  On June 26, 2003, counsel for the plaintiff
class announced that they and counsel for the issuers had agreed to the form of
a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to settle claims against the
issuers.  The terms of that Memorandum
provide that class members will be guaranteed $1 billion in recoveries by the
insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants will assign to the
class members certain claims that they may have against the underwriters.  Issuers also agree to limit their abilities to
bring certain claims against the underwriters. 
If recoveries in excess of $1 billion are obtained by the class from any
non-settling defendants, the settling defendants’ monetary obligations to the
class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount recovered from the underwriters
that is less than $1 billion will be paid by the insurers on behalf of the
issuers.  The Memorandum, which is
subject to the approval of each issuer, was approved by a special committee of
the priceline.com Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3, 2003.  Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff class
and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form of a Stipulation and Agreement
of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and Individuals (“Settlement Agreement”).  The Settlement Agreement implements the
Memorandum and contains the same material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a special committee of the
priceline.com Board of Directors authorized the


Company’s counsel to execute the Settlement
Agreement on behalf of the Company.  The
Settlement Agreement is subject to final approval by the Court and the process
to obtain that approval is still pending. 
However, the ultimate confirmation of the settlement agreement is
uncertain in light of the Second Circuit’s ruling denying class certification
in certain of the lead cases.  The
implications of the Second Circuit’s ruling on the settlement agreement are
still being reviewed by all parties and the District Court.

All of
these cases were assigned to Judge Dominic J. Squatrito.  On September 12, 2001, Judge Squatrito
ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master File No. 3:00cv1884
(DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs’ counsel.  On October 29, 2001, plaintiffs served a Consolidated
Amended Complaint.  On February 5, 2002,
Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc., who was one of the lead plaintiffs in the
consolidated action, made a motion for leave to withdraw as lead plaintiff.  The Court granted that motion on May 30,
2002.  On February 28, 2002, the Company
filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On October 7, 2004, the Court issued a
Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying, in part, the Company’s
motion.  A scheduling order was entered
by the Court on November 2, 2004 and the parties are now proceeding with
discovery.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for
class certification on January 7, 2005, and the Company has filed its
opposition to that motion.  On April 4,
2006, the Court issued a Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying,
in part, the plaintiffs’ motion.  The
Court certified a class and approved five of the six proposed class
representatives.  On May 4, 2006, the
case was transferred to Judge Christopher F. Droney.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for an order
approving the proposed notice of class certification on May 5, 2006 and the
Company filed its response to that motion. 
On May 18, 2006, the case was transferred to Judge Alfred V. Covello.  On October 30, 2006, the Court issued an
Order setting forth a partial schedule, designating December 31, 2007 as the
deadline for the completion of discovery. 
The Company intends to defend vigorously against this action.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome
of these suits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

In
addition, on November 1, 2000 the Company was served with a complaint that
purported to be a shareholder derivative action against its Board of Directors
and certain of its current and former executive officers, as well as the
Company (as a nominal defendant).  The
complaint alleged breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets.  The action is captioned

Mark Zimmerman v. Richard Braddock, J.
Walker, D. Schulman, P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney, W. Ford, M. Loeb, N.
Nicholas, N. Peretsman, and priceline.com Incorporated, 18473-NC (Court of
Chancery of Delaware, County of New Castle, State of


Delaware).  On February 6, 2001, all defendants moved to
dismiss the complaint for failure to make a demand upon the Board of Directors
and failure to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.  Pursuant to a stipulation by the parties, an
amended complaint was filed on June 21, 2001. 
Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss on August 20, 2001, and
plaintiff served his opposition to that motion on October 26, 2001.  Defendants filed their reply brief on January
7, 2002.  On December 20, 2002, the Court
granted defendants’ motion without prejudice. 
On April 25, 2003, a second amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was
filed and a motion seeking leave of court to file the second amended complaint
was filed on July 28, 2003.  That motion
was fully briefed, and oral argument took place on May 9, 2005. Immediately
following oral argument, the Court dismissed three of the four counts in the
second amended complaint.  All of the
counts against defendants Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller,
Peretsman and Schulman have now been dismissed. 
On September 8, 2005, the Court granted plaintiff leave to file the
second amended complaint as to the one remaining count.  Defendants filed a motion requesting that the
Court certify its September 8, 2005 order for interlocutory appeal to the
Delaware Supreme Court, and the Court granted that motion on October 6,
2005.  On October 17, 2005, the Delaware
Supreme Court accepted the interlocutory appeal.  The appeal was fully briefed, and oral
argument took place on February 22, 2006. 
In an Order dated April 3, 2006, the Delaware Supreme Court stated that
the appeal would be scheduled for oral argument and determination by the Court

en banc

without further briefing.  The

en banc

argument took place on June 28, 2006.  On
September 12, 2006, the Delaware Supreme Court decided in favor of the Company
and the Delaware action was thereafter dismissed with prejudice by stipulation.

On
November 7, 2003, the Company was served with a complaint that purported to be
a shareholder derivative action against its Board of Directors and certain of
its current and former executive officers, as well as the Company (as a nominal
defendant).  The complaint alleged, among
other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and
misappropriation of corporate information.

The claims in the
complaint appear to be substantially repetitive of the claims pending in the
derivative action in Delaware which is described above.

The action
is captioned Don Powell

v. Richard S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Daniel H.
Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney, William E. Ford,
Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and Heidi G. Miller and
priceline.com Incorporated (Superior Court, Judicial District of
Stamford/Norwalk, State of Connecticut). 
On January 28, 2004, defendants Blackney, Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb
moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.  On January 29, 2004, defendant Miller moved
to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and for insufficient
service of process.  On February 27,
2004, defendants Braddock, Walker, Schulman, Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Loeb,
Nicholas, Peretsman, Miller and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman
also moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and
insufficient service of process.  At a
hearing on May 3, 2004, the Court stated that it would not rule on the pending
motions until the pending motions in the Delaware action described above are
decided.  The Court conducted a
subsequent status conference on January 10, 2005, at which it requested that
the parties report back no later than March 15, 2005 on the status of the
Delaware derivative suit.  On March 15,
2005, the parties informed the Court in writing that the oral argument in the
Delaware case had been postponed until May 9, 2005, and that the parties would
contact the Court with a status report after that hearing was held.  The Delaware Court dismissed three of the
four counts in the second amended complaint in the Delaware derivative
suit.  All of the counts against the
defendants Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Ford, Loeb, Miller, Peretsman and Schulman
have now been dismissed.  The parties in
the Connecticut action advised the Connecticut Court of the Delaware Court’s ruling
by letter dated June 6, 2005.  The
Delaware Court subsequently granted plaintiff leave to file the second amended
complaint as to the one remaining count. 
Defendants sought an interlocutory appeal of the Delaware Court’s order,
and the Delaware Supreme Court accepted that appeal.  The parties in the Connecticut action advised
the Connecticut Court of those developments by letter dated November 3,
2005.  Following the September 12, 2006
decision by the


Delaware Supreme Court and
the subsequent dismissal of the Delaware derivative action, plaintiffs in the
Connecticut action executed a Withdrawal of their case on January 30, 2007.

Other
Litigation

On
January 6, 1999, the Company received notice that a third party patent
applicant and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston, purportedly had filed in
December 1998 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office a request
to declare an interference between a patent application filed by Woolston and
the Company’s U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  The
Company is currently awaiting information from the Patent Office regarding
whether it will initiate an interference proceeding.

From time to time, the Company has been and expects to
continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of business, including claims of alleged infringement of third party
intellectual property rights by it.  Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from the Company’s
business objectives and could adversely affect the Company’s business, results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Uncertainty
regarding payment of sales and hotel occupancy and other related taxes.

On an ongoing basis, the
Company conducts a review and interpretation of the tax laws in various states
and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and local hotel
occupancy and other related taxes.  In
connection with its review, the Company has met and had discussions with taxing
authorities in certain jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in any
particular jurisdiction cannot be determined at this time.  Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel
occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts
collected by the hotels.  Consistent with
this practice, the Company recovers the taxes on the underlying cost of the
hotel room night from customers and pays that amount to the hotel operators for
payment to the appropriate tax authorities. 
As discussed at length above, several jurisdictions have initiated
lawsuits indicating the position that sales tax or hotel occupancy tax is
applicable to the differential between the price paid by a customer for the
Company’s service and the cost to the Company of the underlying room.  Historically, the Company has not collected
taxes on this differential.  Additional
state and local jurisdictions could assert that the Company is subject to sales
or hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such
taxes, either retroactively or prospectively or both.  Such actions may result in substantial
liabilities for past and/or future sales and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.  To the extent that any tax authority succeeds
in asserting that any such tax collection responsibility exists, it is likely
that, with respect to future transactions, the Company would collect any such
additional tax obligation from its customers, which would have the effect of
increasing the cost of hotel room nights to the Company’s customers and,
consequently, could reduce its hotel sales. 
The Company will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial
impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, it will
reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Employment Contracts

The
Company has employment agreements with certain members of senior management
that provide for cash severance payments of up to approximately $15 million,
accelerated vesting of equity instruments, including without limitation,
restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units upon,
among other things, death or a termination without “cause” or “good reason”, as
those terms are defined in the agreements, and a gross-up for the payment of “golden
parachute” excise taxes.  In addition,
the agreements provide for the extension of health and insurance benefits after
termination for periods of up to three years.


Operating Leases

The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment through operating leases.
Rental expense for operating leases was approximately $3.8 million, $2.8
million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Company’s executive, administrative, operating offices and
network operations center are located in approximately 92,000 square feet of
leased office space located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  Booking.com Limited leases approximately
11,000 square feet of office space primarily in Cambridge, England.  Booking.com B.V. leases approximately 53,000
square feet of office space primarily in Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Minimum payments for operating leases having
initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows
(in thousands):

The
online travel industry recently received guidance in the form of a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service that the fee earned by online intermediaries in
connection with the facilitation of the purchase of airline tickets is not
subject to Federal Excise Tax.  Due to the prior lack of clear guidance
related to the application of federal excise taxes to amounts earned by online
travel intermediaries, the Company historically remitted such taxes on the
amounts it earned for facilitating the purchase of airline tickets.  The
tax at issue was on the amounts earned by the Company and was not added to the
ticket price paid by its customers.  Accordingly, the Company sought
refunds of the taxes it paid while the on-line travel industry pursued
clarification on the issue.  In response to this ruling, the Company has
discontinued remitting tax on these amounts and continues to pursue refunds for
taxes previously paid. Successful recovery of previously paid taxes could
result in a refund of approximately $15 to $20 million. Priceline will not
recognize this potential refund unless and until all required levels of regulatory
approval have been obtained.
