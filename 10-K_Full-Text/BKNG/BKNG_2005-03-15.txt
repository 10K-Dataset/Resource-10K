PART I

Item 1.  Business

General

We are a leading online travel company that offers our customers a broad
range of travel services, including airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals,
vacation packages and cruises.  We offer
our customers a unique choice: the ability to purchase certain travel services
in a traditional, price-disclosed manner or the opportunity to use our unique

Name Your Own Price

®

service,
which allows our customers to make offers for travel services at discounted
prices.  At present, we derive
substantially all of our revenues from the following sources:

•

Transaction
revenues from our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket, hotel room and rental car services, as well as our vacation packages
service;

•

Customer
processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both

Name Your Own Price

®

and
price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars service;

•

Commissions
primarily related to the sale of price-disclosed hotel rooms, including those
sold in Europe by our subsidiary Active Hotels Ltd., rental cars, cruises and
other travel services;

•

Worldspan
reservation booking fees related to both our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket, hotel room and rental car service, and price-disclosed airline ticket
and rental car service;


•

Transaction
revenue from our price-disclosed hotel room service, facilitated principally
through our wholly-owned subsidiary Travelweb LLC; and

•

Other revenues
derived primarily from selling advertising on our websites.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had revenues of
approximately $914 million comprised of “merchant” revenue, “agency” revenue
and “other” revenue.  Merchant revenues
are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and are
responsible for, among other things, establishing the selling price of the
services that we offer.  Merchant
revenues, which represented the substantial majority of our total revenues in
2004, consisted of: (1) transaction revenues in connection with our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel
rooms, rental cars and vacation packages service; (2) customer processing fees
in connection with our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets,
hotel rooms and rental cars service;

(3) transaction revenues
representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged by
suppliers in connection with Travelweb’s hotel rooms service;

and (4)

ancillary fees,
including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms
and rental cars

.  Agency
revenues are generally derived from retail travel related transactions where we
are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the services offered
through our website are determined by third parties and published on our
website (for example, the sale of retail airline tickets). Agency revenues
consisted primarily of: (1) customer processing fees; and (2) third-party
supplier commissions related to the sale of travel services including the sale
of price disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms, cruises and other travel
services; and (3) ancillary fees, including global distribution system (GDS)
reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed transactions.

Other revenues consisted
primarily of advertising revenues we earned for referring customers to others.

Priceline.com was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in
1997 and was converted into a Delaware corporation in July 1998.  Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol “PCLN.” 
Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue,
Norwalk, Connecticut 06854.

The priceline.com Business Model

Name Your Own Price

®

.  We have developed a unique pricing system
known as a “demand collection system” that uses the information sharing and
communications power of the Internet to create a new way of pricing products
and services.  We believe we have created
a balance between the interests of buyers, who are willing to accept trade-offs
in order to save money, and sellers, who are prepared to generate incremental
revenue by selling products at below retail prices, provided that they can do
so without disrupting their existing distribution channels or retail pricing
structures.  Our demand collection system
allows consumers to specify the price they are prepared to pay when submitting
an offer for a particular leisure travel service within a specified range of
substitutability.  We then access databases
in which participating suppliers file secure discounted rates not generally
available to the public, to determine whether we can fulfill the customer’s
offer and then decide whether we want to accept the offer at the price
designated by the consumer.  For most of
these transactions, we establish the price we will accept for our services,
have discretion in supplier selection and are the merchant of record in the
transaction.  Consumers agree to hold
their offers open for a specified period of time (generally, not longer than
one minute) to enable us to fulfill their offers from inventory provided by
participating sellers.  Once fulfilled,
offers generally cannot be canceled – thereby making purchases by our customers
generally non-refundable.  This system
uses the flexibility of buyers to enable sellers to accept a lower price in
order to sell excess inventory or capacity. 
We believe that our demand collection system addresses limitations
inherent in traditional seller-driven pricing mechanisms in a manner that
offers substantial benefits to both buyers and sellers.  We believe that the principal advantages of
our system include the following:

•

Cost Savings

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

demand collection system allows consumers
to save money in a simple and compelling way. 
Buyers effectively trade off flexibility about


brands, product features and/or sellers in
return for prices that are lower than those that can be obtained at that time
through traditional retail distribution channels.

•

Incremental Revenue for Sellers

.  Sellers use our

Name Your Own Price

®

demand collection system as
a revenue management tool to generate incremental revenue without disrupting
their existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures.  We require consumers to be flexible with
respect to brands and product features. 
As a result, our

Name Your Own Price

®

system does not reveal sellers’ brands to customers prior to the consummation
of a transaction, thereby protecting their brand integrity.  This shielding of brand identity and price
enables sellers to sell products and services at discounted prices without
cannibalizing their own retail sales by publicly announcing discount prices and
without competing against their own distributors.

•

Proprietary Seller Networks

.  We have assembled proprietary networks of
industry leading sellers that represent high quality brands.  By establishing attractive networks of seller
participants with reputations for quality, scale and national presence, we
believe that we foster increased participation by both buyers and sellers.

We often refer to products offered through our

Name Your Own Price

®

service as
“opaque” products.

Retail Products

.  In 2003, we began offering
customers the ability

to purchase price-disclosed
airline tickets at retail prices

.

Additionally, in

the
fourth quarter 2003, we launched a new package service with disclosed prices
and more flight options, and in the first quarter 2004, we re-launched the
package service with a new feature that gives consumers the option to include
retail price-disclosed tickets for the air component of their package.  In these transactions, we act as agent for
the travel supplier.

The
travel supplier sets the retail price paid by the consumer, and the supplier is
the merchant of record for the transaction.

In 2003, we also invested in and
entered into a distribution agreement with Travelweb LLC (“Travelweb”), a
full-service automated hotel distribution network owned by various affiliates
of Marriott International, Inc., Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hyatt Corporation,
Intercontinental Hotels Group, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.
and Pegasus Solutions, Inc.  Under the
terms of the agreement, Travelweb became the primary provider of
published-price hotel inventory in the United States and Canada for
priceline.com and Lowestfare.com, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
priceline.com.  In May 2004,
Lowestfare.com acquired all of the equity interest in Travelweb owned by
Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Starwood Hotels and Pegasus Solutions.  In December 2004, Lowestfare.com
acquired all of the equity interest in Travelweb held by InterContinental
Hotels Group, making Travelweb a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Lowestfare.com.  We intend to use inventory
made available to Travelweb’s customers to launch a price disclosed hotel
service on the priceline.com site in the first half of 2005.  Our intent is to provide customers maximum
flexibility by allowing them to select a retail itinerary or to make use of the

Name Your Own Price

®

service.

In

September 2004, we acquired Active Hotels Ltd. (“Active Hotels”),
a United Kingdom based Internet hotel reservation distributor for approximately
$165.4 million in cash, including transaction related costs.  Active Hotels works with over 8,500
properties in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe, including international
chains and independent properties.  Its
distribution network encompasses company-owned websites, such as

activereservations.com

, as well as over affiliated
third-party 1,000 websites operating throughout Europe.  Active Hotels’ price-disclosed reservation
services are available in English, French, Spanish, German and Italian.  For geographic related information, see Note
21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, in 2003, we purchased
the Internet domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com, and their
related intellectual property.  Through
these sites, we offer consumers


access to over 50 retail rental car suppliers and earn
commissions on successful rental car reservation bookings.

We believe that the combination of
our

Name Your Own Price

®

model and our retail price-disclosed model allows us to service a broad array
of value-conscious travelers, while providing us with diverse streams of
revenue.

The priceline.com Strategy

The online travel category has continued to
experience significant worldwide growth as consumer purchasing shifts from
traditional off-line channels to interactive online channels.  Priceline.com has been a leader in the deep
discount segment of this market and, in the last two years, has embarked on a
strategy to more broadly participate in online travel growth by expanding its
service offerings and markets.

•

Expand Service Offerings

.  In 2003, we began to execute a plan to
broaden our array of service offerings beyond our

Name Your Own Price

®

services.  Specifically, we have expended significant
resources to allow us to introduce price-disclosed retail services to our
consumers to compliment our existing

Name
Your Own Price

®

service. 
We believe that by offering a “one-stop-shopping” solution to our
customers, we can simultaneously fulfill the needs of those customers who are
prepared to accept the unique requirements of our

Name Your Own Price

®

service in exchange for
receiving significant savings relative to retail prices, as well as those
customers who are less price sensitive and require the certainty of knowing the
full details of their travel itinerary prior to purchasing.  We believe that our evolution to a “one-stop-shopping”
website will allow us to more fully participate in the overall growth of the
on-line travel category.

Airline Tickets

.  In the fourth quarter 2003, we launched our
new price-disclosed airline service, which significantly improved conversion of
site traffic.  Although the new service
resulted in a decrease of

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline ticket sales, total unit sales of airline
tickets in 2004 increased by 53% on a year-over-year basis, and the gross
profit contribution from such increase more than offset the decrease in

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket sales.  We believe that offering
retail airline tickets as a complement to

Name
Your Own Price

®

tickets will continue to improve total
airline ticket sales and improve demand for our other services.

Hotel Business

.  In 2004, we expanded our retail hotel
offering by purchasing all of the equity interest of Travelweb that we did not
already own.  In addition, as discussed
above, we acquired Active Hotels, a United Kingdom based Internet hotel
reservation distributor, which gives us a foothold into the expanding European
hotel market.  In 2005, we intend to
integrate the retail hotel inventory of Travelweb into the priceline.com hotel
offering similar to the way we integrated a retail airline ticket offering with
our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline service.

Vacation Packages Service

.  In
the fourth quarter 2003, we launched a new package service with disclosed
prices and more flight options, and in the first quarter 2004, we re-launched
the package service with a new feature that gives consumers the option to
include retail tickets for the air component of their package.  Additionally, in 2004, we upgraded our
packages service to enable consumers to add a rental car and certain
destination activities to their packages. 
These changes had a positive effect on the results of our packages
service and we intend to continue to develop this service by, among other
things, expanding available destinations and participating hotel and resort
properties.

Rental Cars

. 
In 2003, we supplemented our

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental car offering by acquiring the
Internet domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com in


addition to other domain names, and their
related intellectual property. Through these sites, we offer consumers access
to over 50 retail rental car suppliers and earn commissions on successful
rental car reservation bookings.  Currently, we operate both sites as
stand-alone websites that contain their own search and booking engine
functionality, as well as links to rental car suppliers and priceline.com.  In October 2004, we launched a new
rental car service that gives consumers the ability to choose from a list of
low rental car rates, or on www.priceline.com, to use the

Name Your Own Price

®

model.

Add-On Purchases

.  In 2004, we developed functionality that
allows customers to “add-on” a rental car reservation to their airline ticket
at the time of purchase.  We intend to
deploy more add-on purchase opportunities to our single product paths,
including the purchase of destination related services such as tours and
activities.

Advertising

. 
Prior to 2004, substantially all of our advertising efforts were spent
on promoting our

Name Your Own Price

®

service.  We believe that our historical
advertising campaigns were highly successful in firmly establishing
priceline.com as a brand that stands for consumer value.  With the introduction of our retail airline
ticket service at the end of 2003, we began a new advertising campaign, which
sought to broaden the brand attributes of priceline.com to include convenience
and choice.  In 2005, we intend to
continue aggressively advertising the expansion of our service offerings.

•

Grow Hotel Service

.  Our hotel service represents our highest
margin service offering.  Because this
service has superior financial characteristics, we have expended and will
continue to expend significant internal product development and external
corporate development resources on growing this service.  For example, in 2004, we made strategic
acquisitions of Travelweb, a full-service automated retail hotel distribution
network, and Active Hotels, a United Kingdom based Internet hotel reservation
distributor.  In 2004, we sold over 7.7
million room nights; an increase of 36% over 2003.

•

Expand Internationally

.  The size of the travel market outside of the
United States is substantially greater than that within the United States.  Historically, Internet adoption rates and
e-commerce adoption rates of international consumers have trailed those of the
United States.  However, international
consumers – particularly European consumers – are rapidly moving to on-line
means for purchasing travel. 
Accordingly, international on-line travel growth rates have
substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to substantially exceed the
growth rates within the United States. 
Prior to 2004, substantially all of our revenues were generated within
the United States.  In order to take
advantage of the growth in on-line travel outside of the United States, in September 2004,
we acquired Active Hotels, giving us a foothold into the expanding European
hotel market, as well as access to European inventory.  Because of the superior growth rates
associated with international on-line travel, we intend to continue to invest
resources in increasing the share of our revenues represented by international consumers.

Products and Services

Travel Services

Name Your Own Price

®

Leisure
Airline Tickets

.  There are a
total of 9 domestic airlines and 26 international airlines participating in our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service.

All

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket requests are made through our websites.  To make an offer, a customer specifies: (1)
the origin and destination of the trip, (2) the dates on which the customer
wishes to depart and return, (3) the price the customer is willing to pay, and
(4) the customer’s valid credit card to guarantee the offer.  When making an offer, consumers must agree
to:


•

fly
on any one of our participating airline partners;

•

leave
at any time of day between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. on their desired dates of
departure and return;

•

purchase
only round trip coach class tickets between the same two points of departure
and return;

•

accept
at least one stop or connection;

•

receive
no frequent flier miles or upgrades; and

•

accept
tickets that cannot be refunded or changed.

When we receive an offer, we determine whether to fulfill the offer
based upon, among other things, the available fares, rules and inventory
provided to us by our participating airlines and certain other internal
requirements.  A customer is usually
notified whether his or her offer has been accepted in near real-time.  If we identify an airline ticket that meets
the parameters specified by the customer and that meets our internal
requirements, the customer’s offer is accepted and his or her credit card is
charged the offer price, plus applicable taxes, surcharges and processing fees,
and the ticket is delivered to the customer by the delivery method specified by
the customer.  For customers who request
it, we guarantee no more than one connection per leg of trip with a maximum of
a 3-hour stop.  As with our other

Name Your Own Price

®

travel services, once a customer’s
offer for airline tickets is accepted, that offer, in almost all cases, cannot
be withdrawn or cancelled and the customer’s purchase cannot be refunded.

If a customer’s offer is not accepted, but we believe the offer is
reasonably close to a price that we would be willing to accept, we will attempt
to satisfy the customer by providing guidance to the customer indicating that
changing certain parameters of the offer would increase the chances of the
offer being accepted.  For example, in
some cases we disclose to the customer that agreeing to fly into an alternate
airport would increase the chances of his or her offer being accepted.  In other cases, we inform the customer that
increasing his or her offer by a certain amount would increase the chances of
it being accepted.  We may also offer a customer
the opportunity to purchase a price-disclosed retail airline ticket through
Lowestfare.com.

Retail Leisure Airline Tickets.

In 2002, we began offering certain customers
who were unsuccessful in making a

Name Your
Own Price

®

airline ticket
offer the option to purchase a retail airline ticket at a disclosed price
through Lowestfare.com.  In

October 2003,
we expanded this offering by launching a new feature on our website that allows
our customers to purchase retail airline tickets at disclosed prices and with
disclosed itineraries.  In these
transactions, we act as agent for the airline. 
The airline sets the retail price paid by the consumer and is the
merchant of record for the transaction. 
We believe that the combination of our

Name
Your Own Price

®

model and this retail model allows us to
service a broad array of value-conscious travelers, while providing us with
diverse streams of revenue.

Hotels

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel room
reservation service currently is available in substantially all major cities
and metropolitan areas in the United States and Europe.  Seller participants in the hotel room
reservation service include most of the significant national hotel chains as
well as several important real estate investment trusts and independent
property owners.  Hotels participate by
filing secure private discounted rates with related inventory control rules in
a global distribution system database. 
These specific rates generally are not available to the general public
or to consolidators and other discount distributors who sell to the public,
however, hotel participants may make similar rates available to consolidators
or other discount providers under other arrangements.


Our

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room reservation service operates in a manner similar to our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service. 
Consumers are required to accept certain trade-offs with respect to
brands or product features in return for saving money.  For example, consumers are required to accept
a reservation in any hotel within a specified geographic area within a
designated “class” of service (1, 2, 3, 4, 5-star or “resort”) and must accept
limitations on changes and cancellations. 
As with the airline ticket service, the target market for our hotel room
reservation service is the leisure travel market.

In connection with our acquisition of Travelweb, we

intend to expand and grow our retail
hotel business.

Furthermore,
our acquisition of Active Hotels gives us a foothold into the expanding
European hotel market, as well as access to European inventory.

Rental Cars

.  Our

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental car service operates in a manner
similar to our airline ticket and hotel reservation services.  Our rental car services are currently
available in substantially all major United States airport markets.  The top five brand name airport rental car
companies in the United States are seller participants in our rental car
program.  Consumers can access our
website and select where and when they want to rent a car, what kind of car
they want to rent (i.g., economy, compact, mid-size, SUV, etc.) and the price
they want to pay per-day, excluding taxes, fees and surcharges.  When we receive an offer, we determine
whether to fulfill the offer based upon the available rates, rules and
inventory.  If a customer’s offer is
accepted, we will immediately reserve the rental car, charge the customer’s
credit card and notify the customer of the car rental company and location
providing the rental car.

In 2003, we supplemented our

Name
Your Own Price

®

rental car offering by acquiring the
Internet domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com, and their
related intellectual property.

Through these sites, we offer
consumers access to over 50 retail rental car suppliers and earn commissions on
rental car reservation bookings at disclosed prices.  Currently, we operate both sites as
stand-alone websites that contain their own search and booking engine
functionality, as well as links to rental car suppliers and priceline.com.  In October 2004, we launched a new rental
car

service

that gives consumers the ability to choose from a
list of low disclosed rental car rates, or on www.priceline.com, to use the

Name
Your Own Price

®

model.

Vacation Packages

.  In February 2002, we began offering our
vacation package service, which allowed consumers to determine their own price
for packages consisting of airfare and hotel or resort room nights.

In

the fourth quarter 2003, we
launched a new package service with disclosed prices and more flight options,
and in the first quarter 2004, we re-launched the package service with a new
feature that gives consumers the option to include retail tickets for the air
component of their package. 
Additionally, in 2004, we upgraded our packages service to enable
consumers to add a rental car and certain destination activities to their
packages.

Destination Services

.  We currently offer vacation package
purchasers the opportunity to purchase tickets, transfers, tours, restaurant
meals and other services available at their travel destinations.  We intend to expand this offering to other
service paths.

Cruises

.  We also offer fixed-price cruise trips
through NLG, Inc. (“NLG”), an agent representing major cruise lines.  Our cruise service allows consumers to search
for and compare cruise pricing and availability information from 16 cruise
lines, and to purchase cruises online or through a call center by selecting
from our published offerings and prices. 
We receive commissions from NLG for our services.

Travel Insurance

.  We offer our air, hotel and vacation package
customers an optional travel insurance package that provides coverage for,
among other things, trip cancellation, trip interruption, medical expenses,
emergency evacuation, and loss of baggage, property and travel documents.  The travel insurance is provided by member
companies of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”).  We receive


a percentage of the premium from AIG member
companies for every optional insurance package purchased by our customers.

While we are currently focused on the travel services described above,
over time, we may evaluate the introduction of other services that we believe
could enhance the travel experience of our customers.

Financial Services

We offer financial services through Priceline
Mortgage Company LLC, d/b/a pricelinemortgage.com, of which we own 49% and hold
two of five seats on the board of managers.  Pursuant to an intellectual
property license from us, pricelinemortgage.com utilizes the priceline.com

Name Your Own Price®

business model.  Pricelinemortgage.com is controlled by
EverBank, a federally chartered savings association supervised by the Office of
Thrift Supervision, and a wholly owned subsidiary of EverBank Financial Corp. 
Pricelinemortgage.com has access to the management resources and expertise of
EverBank, one of the nation’s largest privately held banking and mortgage
firms. EverBank Financial Corp. provides management services to
pricelinemortgage.com, including the procurement of personnel and office space
and assistance in obtaining regulatory approvals.  Pricelinemortgage.com
is operating in all 50 states.  Robert J. Mylod, our Chief Financial
Officer, is a director of, and an investor in, EverBank Financial Corp, the parent
company of EverBank.  Mr. Mylod’s investment represents less than 1/10 of
one percent of EverBank Financial Corp’s outstanding common stock.

Under the terms of an agreement with EverBank
Financial Corp, pricelinemortgage.com allows consumers to access attractive
financial services including, but not limited to, mortgages, home equity loans,
and banking service.  We record our
proportionate share of the results of pricelinemortgage.com as equity income in
investees.

Marketing and Brand Awareness

Priceline.com has established itself as one
of the most recognized e-commerce brands through an aggressive marketing and
promotion campaign.  During 2004, our
online and offline advertising expenses were $27.5 million and $33.5 million,
respectively.  We intend to continue a
marketing strategy to promote brand awareness and the concept that consumers
can save money on products and services while also taking advantage of the “one-stop-shop”
convenience afforded by the introduction of retail products to our suite of

Name Your Own Price

®

service
offerings.  We advertise primarily
through television, radio and online marketing. 
Underlying our marketing strategy is our belief that our target market
is all consumers, not just Internet-savvy consumers.  We intend to continue to promote the
priceline.com brand aggressively throughout 2005.

Advertising Revenue.

We sell
advertising to travel suppliers and others on our owned websites, including
www.priceline.com, www.lowestfare.com, www.travelweb.com, www.rentalcars.com,
www.breezenet.com and www.mytravelguide.com, a travel information site acquired
in 2004 and relaunched with upgraded content in December 2004.

Competition

We compete
with both online and traditional sellers of the products and services offered
on priceline.com. The market for the products and services we offer is
intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new sites at
a relatively low cost. In addition, over the recent past, the on-line travel
industry has consolidated, a trend we expect to continue.  As a result of this consolidation, the major
on-line travel companies with which we compete are owned by large
well-capitalized companies.  For
instance, the Cendant Corporation recently acquired and owns, Orbitz.com, Inc.,
Cheaptickets.com, Lodging.com and ebookers plc, a leading European travel site,
and Sabre Group owns Travelocity.com.


In addition, InterActive Corp. currently owns
Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire.com, our primary competitor in the sale of “opaque”
travel services.  InterActive has
recently announced its intention to spin-off its on-line travel business into
Expedia, which, as a stand-alone company, would continue to have significantly
greater resources and capital than priceline.com.  See “

Factors
That May Affect Future Results – Intense competition could reduce our market
share and harm our financial performance

.”

We currently or potentially compete with a
variety of companies with respect to each product or service we offer. With
respect to our travel services, these competitors include:

•

Internet
travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, all of which are owned
by InterActive Corp., Travelocity, which is owned by the Sabre Group and
Cheaptickets, Orbitz.com, ebookers plc and Lodging.com, which are owned by the
Cendant Corporation;

•

traditional
travel agencies;

•

individual
or groups of airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators and other
travel service providers (all of which may provide services by telephone or
through their branded website);

•

on-line
travel search sites such as SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com, Cheapflights.com,
Farechase, Kayak.com, or any substantially similar on-line travel search
business; and

•

operators
of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo, Worldspan, L.P. and
Amadeus.

Hotwire, which is our primary competitor in
the sale of opaque travel services, provides airline tickets, hotel rooms and
rental car reservations at disclosed prices, although supplier identity and
exact flight times are undisclosed until after the customer agrees to the
purchase.  In addition, Hotwire recently
launched a retail airline ticket offering. 
Since its launch, Hotwire has been successful in establishing itself in
the online travel marketplace through aggressive advertising, which has had the
effect of decreasing our market share in the opaque channel.

With respect to financial services,
competitors of pricelinemortgage.com include banks and other financial
institutions and online and traditional mortgage and insurance brokers,
including E*Trade, ditech.com, mortgage.com, Quicken Mortgage, E-Loan, Lending
Tree, which is owned by InterActive Corp., and iOwn, Inc.

We potentially face competition from a number of large Internet companies
and services that have expertise in developing online commerce and in
facilitating Internet traffic, including Amazon.com, AOL, MSN, Google.com and
Yahoo!, who compete with us either directly or indirectly through affiliations
with other e-commerce or off-line companies. For example, in July 2004,
Yahoo! acquired FareChase, a travel search-engine that searches for fares and
hotel rates at travel supplier and third-party websites, and refers traffic to
those sites.  If Yahoo! or other portals
decide to refer significant traffic to travel search engines, it could result
in more competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition
costs for third-party sites such as ours. 
Other large companies with strong brand recognition, technical expertise
and experience in Internet commerce could also seek to compete with us.

Many of our current and potential competitors,
including Internet directories, search engines and large traditional retailers,
have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand
recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other
resources than priceline.com. Some of these competitors may be able to secure
products and services on more favorable terms than we can. In addition, many of
these competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to:

•

marketing
and promotional campaigns;


•

attracting
traffic to their websites;

•

attracting
and retaining key employees;

•

securing
vendors and inventory; and

•

website
and systems development.

In addition, many airline, hotel and rental
car suppliers have begun to focus on driving online demand to their own
websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as us.  Certain suppliers have attempted to charge
additional fees to customers who book airline reservations through an on-line
channel other than their own website. 
Furthermore, many low cost airlines, who are having increasing success
in the marketplace, distribute their inventory exclusively through their own
websites.  Suppliers who sell on their
own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances,
offer advantages such as bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their
offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.

Increased competition could result in reduced
operating margins, loss of market share and damage to our brand. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors.  See “

Factors That May Affect Future Results – Intense
competition reduce our market share and harm our financial performance

.”

Operations and Technology

Our business is supported by a systems platform, which was designed
with an emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability.  Our core demand collection and offer
processing systems are proprietary to priceline.com.  The software platform and architecture are
built on server-side Java, C++ and SQL scripts integrated with an Oracle relational
database system.  This internal platform
was designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide
connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate.  These include large global inventory systems,
such as airline and hotel room reservation systems and financial service
providers, as well as individual inventory suppliers, such as individual
hotels.  Our Internet servers utilize
VeriSign digital certificates to help us conduct secure communications and
transactions.

We out-source most of our call center and
customer service functions, and use a real-time interactive voice response
system with transfer capabilities to our call centers and customer service
centers in Norwalk, Connecticut; Columbus, Ohio; Sunrise, Florida; Brownsville,
Pennsylvania and Salt Lake City, Utah.

We rely on the global distribution system (“GDS”) of Worldspan, L.P. in
the sale of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations, and rental car
reservations within the U.S. and Pegasus Solutions, Inc. for the sale of retail
hotel room reservations through Travelweb. 
We do not have a back-up GDS and if the Worldspan or Pegasus GDS becomes
inaccessible, or partially inaccessible to us, due to system failure or otherwise,
for any significant amount of time, our ability to book airline tickets, opaque
hotel reservations and rental car reservations in the case of Worldspan, and
retail hotel reservations in the case of Pegasus, would be adversely affected.

Our systems infrastructure and web and
database servers are hosted at SAVVIS in Jersey City, New Jersey, which
provides communication links, as well as 24-hour monitoring and engineering
support.  SAVVIS has its own generator
and multiple back-up systems in Jersey City. 
Substantial amounts of our computer hardware for operating our services
are also located at SAVVIS in Jersey City. 
We also maintain a second web hosting facility at AT&T in New York
City.  Our network operations center
monitors both web hosting facilities and is located in our Norwalk, Connecticut
headquarters.  All three facilities have
an uninterruptible power supply system, generators and redundant servers.  If SAVVIS were unable, for any reason, to
support our primary web hosting facility, we would need to


activate our secondary site at AT&T.  The systems infrastructure and web and
database servers of Active Hotels are hosted at IX EUROPE, in London,
England.  See “

Factors That May Affect Future Results – We Rely on Third-Party Systems

Intellectual Property

We currently hold sixteen issued United
States patents, Nos. 5,794,207; 5,797,127; 5,897,620; 6,041,308; 6,085,169;
6,108,639; 6,134,534; 6,240,396; 6,332,129; 6,345,090; 6,356,878; 6,418,415;
6,466,919; 6,484,153; 6,510,418; 6,553,346 and over twenty pending United
States and foreign patent applications. 
All of our issued United States patents expire between September 4,
2016 and July 8, 2017.  We file
additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate.

While we believe that our issued patents and
pending patent applications help to protect our business, there can be no
assurance that:

•

any
patent can be successfully defended against challenges by third parties;

•

the
pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

•

competitors
or potential competitors of priceline.com will not devise new methods of
competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications;

•

because
of variations in the application of our business model to each of our services,
our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties from
utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more
categories;

•

new
prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate
an issued patent;

•

a
third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that can prevent us
from practicing features of our business or that will require us to pay for a
license to use those features; or

•

our
operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of third
parties.

There has been discussion in the press regarding the examination and
issuance of so-called “business method” patents. As a result, the United States
Patent and Trademark Office has indicated that it intends to intensify the
review process applicable to such patent applications. The new procedures are
not expected to have a direct

effect on patents already
granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if any, the new review process will
have on our pending patent applications. See, “

We monitor, protect and enforce our copyrights, service marks,
trademarks, trade dress and trade secrets on an ongoing basis through a
combination of laws and contractual restrictions, such as


confidentiality agreements.  For example, we endeavor to register our
trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally,
currently holding over one hundred service mark registrations worldwide.  However, effective trademark, service mark,
copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in
which our services are or may be made available online, regardless of our
continuous efforts to police and register our marks.  See, “

We currently own the Internet domain name

priceline.com

in the United States, and

priceline.ca

in Canada.  Domain names are generally regulated by
Internet regulatory bodies.  The
relationship between trademark and unfair competition laws and domain name
registration is evolving.  The Anticybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act in the U.S. and the Uniform Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
have both significantly enhanced the ability to deter the improper
incorporation of trademarks into domain names by third parties and to assert
our registrations against them.  We
actively pursue significant infringers as appropriate, including cybersquatters
and “typosquatters” who misappropriate our service marks and misspellings
thereof as domain names, to maintain our famous marks and prevent the dilution
of their distinctiveness.  See, “

Factors That May Affect Future Results — Our Success
Depends On Our Ability To Protect Our Intellectual Property

.”

Governmental Regulation

The services we provide are subject to various federal, state and local
regulations. For example, our travel service is subject to laws governing the
offer and/or sale of travel services as well as laws requiring us to register
as a “seller of travel.”  In addition,
our services may be subject to various state and local taxing regulations.  See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings –

Uncertainty regarding payment of sales and hotel
occupancy and other related taxes

”.

In addition, our business
is indirectly affected by regulatory and legal uncertainties affecting travel
suppliers and global distribution systems. 
On January 7, 2004, the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”)
published a Final Rule, abolishing most of its rules governing global
distribution systems effective January 31, 2004, and the rest of the rules
effective July 31, 2004.  As a part
of the Final Rule, the DOT rejected proposals to regulate online travel service
providers’ fare displays.  However, the
DOT deferred consideration of a proposal to amend its policies regarding
advertising of air tickets, to require that agency service fees be stated
separately from the price being charged by the airlines.  Our current service fee disclosure practices
differ from those proposed by the DOT. 
If the DOT were to resume consideration of and adopt the service fee
proposal, we may have less flexibility regarding merchandising air travel on
our websites.

Pricelinemortgage.com
is subject to laws governing the licensing and conduct of persons providing
mortgage brokerage services. Such laws typically require certain consumer
protection disclosures and loan solicitation procedures. For example, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act prohibits the payment and receipt of mortgage
loan referral fees, and permits persons to be compensated only for the fair market
value of non-referral services. Accordingly, pricelinemortgage.com’s home
financing service provides non-referral services such as website development
and advertising to a licensed mortgage broker who, in turn, provides the
back-end processing for loan referrals.

All of our services are subject to federal and state consumer
protection laws and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade
practices.

We are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses conducting
online commerce. Today there are relatively few laws specifically directed
toward online services. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of
the Internet and online services, it is possible that laws and regulations will
be adopted with respect to the Internet or online services. These laws and
regulations could cover issues such as online contracts, user privacy, freedom
of expression, pricing, fraud, content and quality of products and services,
taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Applicability
to


the Internet of existing laws governing issues
such as property ownership, copyrights and other intellectual property issues,
taxation, libel, obscenity and personal privacy is developing, but any such new
legislation could have significant implications on how we conduct online
business. In addition, some states may require us to qualify in that state to
do business as a foreign corporation because our service is available in that
state over the Internet. Although we are qualified to do business in a number
of states, failure to meet the qualifications of certain states, or a
determination that we are required to qualify in additional states, could
subject us to taxes and penalties.  See “

Factors That May Affect Future Results – Regulatory
and legal uncertainties could harm our business,”

and

“Uncertainty Regarding State Taxes

.”

Active Hotels, priceline.com europe and Hutchison-Priceline Limited are
subject to various foreign regulations and governing bodies that might limit
their products and services. They may be affected by unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements and various tariffs and trade barriers in connection
with online commerce. Any failure by Active Hotels, priceline.com europe or
Hutchison-Priceline Limited to comply may have an adverse effect on our
business.

Employees

As of March 1, 2005, we employed approximately 438 full-time
employees, of which 328 are based at our Norwalk, Connecticut headquarters. We
also retain independent contractors to support our customer service and system
support functions.

We have never had a work stoppage and our employees are not represented
by any collective bargaining unit. We consider our relations with our employees
to be good. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue
to attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and
managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense.

Factors That
May Affect Future Results

The following risk factors and other
information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered.  The risks and uncertainties described below
are not the only ones we face. 
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks occur, our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be
materially adversely affected.

We are dependent on
the airline industry and certain airlines.

Our financial prospects are significantly
dependent upon our sale of leisure airline tickets.  Leisure travel, including the sale of leisure
airline tickets, is dependent on personal discretionary spending levels. As a
result, sales of leisure airline tickets and other leisure travel services tend
to decline during general economic downturns and recessions. In addition,
unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, political instability, regional
hostilities, increases in fuel prices, imposition of taxes or surcharges by
regulatory authorities, travel-related accidents, travel-related health
concerns and unusual weather patterns also may adversely affect the leisure
travel industry. As a result, our business also is likely to be affected by
those events. Further, work stoppages or labor unrest at any of the major
airlines could materially and adversely affect the airline industry and, as a
consequence, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

During the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, sales of airline tickets from our five largest and two largest airline
suppliers accounted for approximately 78.0% and 41.2% of total airline tickets
sold, respectively. As a result, currently we are substantially dependent upon
the continued participation of these airlines in priceline.com in order to
maintain and continue to grow our total gross profit.


We currently have 35 airlines participating in
the

Name Your Own Price

®

system. However, our arrangements with the airlines that participate in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system:

•

do
not require the airlines to make tickets available for any particular routes;

•

do
not require the airlines to provide any specific quantity of airline tickets;

•

do
not require the airlines to provide particular prices or levels of discount;

•

do
not require the airlines to deal exclusively with us in the public sale of
discounted airline tickets;

•

often
limit the manner in which we can sell inventory and, in the case of our
agreement with Delta Air Lines, substantially limits which airlines can
participate in the

Name Your Own Price

®

system; and

•

generally,
can be terminated upon little or no notice.

As a general matter, during the course of our
business, we are in continuous dialogue with our major airline suppliers about
the nature and extent of their participation in our system. The significant
reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their participation in
our system – either

Name Your Own Price

®

or price-disclosed service – for a sustained period of time or their complete
withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. 
Moreover, certain airlines have significantly limited or eliminated
sales of airline tickets through “opaque” channels, preferring to consistently
show the lowest available price on their own website.  If one or more participating airlines were to
further limit or eliminate discounting through opaque channels, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.  In addition, the airline
industry has experienced a shift in market share from full-service carriers to
low-cost carriers that focus primarily on discount fares to leisure
destinations and we expect this trend to continue.  Some low-cost carriers, such as Southwest or
Jet Blue, do not distribute their tickets through us or other third-party
intermediaries.

Due to our dependence on the airline industry,
we could be severely affected by changes in that industry, and, in many cases,
we will have no control over such changes or their timing.  Several major U.S. airlines are struggling
financially and have either filed for reorganization under the United States
Bankruptcy Code or discussed publicly the risks of bankruptcy. To the extent
other major U.S. airlines that participate in our system declare bankruptcy,
they may be unable or unwilling to honor tickets sold for their flights. Our
policy in such event would be to direct customers seeking a refund or exchange
to the airline, and not to provide a remedy ourselves. Because we are the
merchant-of-record on sales of

Name Your Own
Price

®

airline tickets to our customers, however, we
could experience a significant increase in demands for refunds or credit card
charge-backs from customers, which would materially and adversely affect our
operations and financial results. In addition, because

Name Your Own Price

®

customers
do not choose the airlines on which they are to fly, the bankruptcy of a major
U.S. airline or the possibility of a major U.S. airline declaring bankruptcy
could discourage customers from using our

Name
Your Own Price

®

system to book airline tickets.

In addition, given the concentration of the
airline industry, particularly in the domestic market, our competitors could
exert pressure on other airlines not to supply us with tickets. Moreover, the
airlines may attempt to establish their own buyer-driven commerce service or
participate or invest in other similar services.


We are
dependent on certain hotels

.

Our financial prospects are significantly
dependent upon the sale of hotel room nights. 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, sales of

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room
nights from our five largest hotel suppliers accounted for approximately 46.9%
of total

Name Your Own Price

®

hotel room nights sold.  As a result,
currently we are substantially dependent upon the continued participation of
these hotels in priceline.com’s hotel service in order to maintain and continue
to grow our total gross profit.

We currently have more than 40 national hotel
chains participating in the

Name Your Own
Price

®

system. 
However, our arrangements with the hotels that participate in our

Name Your Own Price

®

system
generally:

•

do not require the hotels to make available to
our customers any specific quantity of hotel rooms;

•

do not require the hotels to provide
particular prices or levels of discount;

•

do not require the hotels to deal exclusively
with us in the public sale of discounted hotel rooms; and

•

generally, can be terminated upon little or no
notice.

As a general matter, during the course of our
business, we are in continuous dialogue with our major hotel suppliers about
the nature and extent of their participation in our system.  Improving economic conditions are creating
increased demand for hotel rooms and some hotels may reduce the amount of
inventory they sell through our service or increase the negotiated rates at
which they are willing to provide inventory. 
If hotel occupancy rates improve to the point that our hotel suppliers
no longer place the same value on our distribution systems, such suppliers may
reduce the amount of inventory they make available through priceline.com,
Travelweb and Active Hotels.  The
significant reduction on the part of any of our major suppliers of their
participation in our system for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

In addition, certain hotels have begun
initiatives to reduce margins received by third party intermediaries on
disclosed price merchant transactions, which is the primary method we employ to
distribute disclosed price hotel room reservations.  While Travelweb’s agreements with its leading
hotel suppliers provide for specified discounts, if one or more participating
hotels were to require us to limit our merchant margins, upon contract renewal
or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to
satisfy customers may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of
our control.

Most domestic airlines, and many of our major
suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, significant
losses.  These losses have been
compounded by competition from low-cost carriers and, most recently, by high
fuel prices.  As a result of these and
other factors, many of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline
tickets to maintain market share, which has had a detrimental effect on our
business.

Deep retail discounting
by the airlines affects our demand by hurting the

Name Your Own Price

®

value proposition and making
users less willing to accept the trade-offs associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

leisure
airline tickets service.  In particular,
we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be
willing to make the tradeoff associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

service in exchange for
savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase travel services at the lower
retail rates or from low-cost carriers without having to make any trade-offs.


We rely on the global distribution system of
Worldspan, L.P. in the sale of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations,
and rental car reservations, and Pegasus Solutions, Inc. in the sale of retail
hotel reservations.  We do not have a
back-up GDS and if the Worldspan or Pegasus GDS becomes inaccessible, or
partially inaccessible to us, due to system failure or otherwise, for any
significant amount of time, our ability to book airline tickets, opaque hotel
reservations and rental car reservations in the case of Worldspan, and retail
hotel reservations in the case of Pegasus, would be adversely affected, and our
results would suffer.

The bankruptcy,
discontinuance or consolidation of our suppliers could harm our business

.

We are heavily dependent on our
suppliers.  Two of our largest airline
suppliers, United Airlines and U.S. Airways, are currently operating under the
protection of federal bankruptcy laws, and certain other major suppliers, including
Delta Air Lines, have disclosed publicly the possibility of seeking the
protection of the federal bankruptcy laws. If any of our suppliers currently in
bankruptcy liquidates or does not emerge from bankruptcy and we are unable to
replace such supplier as a participant in priceline.com, our business would be
adversely affected. In addition, in the event that another of our major
suppliers voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy and is subsequently
unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy, and we are unable to replace
such supplier, our business would be adversely affected. Further, as discussed
in “

We are dependent on the airline industry
and certain airlines

”, because our

Name
Your Own Price

®

customers do not choose the airline,
hotel or rental car company on which they are booked, the bankruptcy of a major
supplier or even the possibility of a major supplier declaring bankruptcy,
could discourage consumers from booking their travel through us.  If any or all of such companies discontinue
their business, and we are unable to find other suppliers, it would have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

If one of our major suppliers merges or
consolidates with, or is acquired by, another company that either does not
participate in the priceline.com system or that participates on substantially
lower levels, the surviving company may elect not to participate in our system
or to participate at lower levels than the previous supplier.  In addition, fewer independent suppliers
reduces opacity and competition among suppliers.  In such event, if we are unable to divert
sales to other suppliers, our business results of operations and financial
condition may be adversely affected.

Intense competition
could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance

.

We compete with both online and traditional
sellers of the services offered on priceline.com. The market for the services
we offer is intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch
new sites at a relatively low cost. In addition, over the recent past, the
on-line travel industry has consolidated, a trend we expect to continue. As a
result of this consolidation, the major on-line travel companies with which we
compete are owned by large well-capitalized companies.  For instance, the Cendant Corporation
recently acquired and owns, Orbitz.com, Inc., Cheaptickets.com, Lodging.com and
ebookers plc, a leading European travel site, and Sabre Group owns
Travelocity.com.  In addition,
InterActive Corp. currently owns Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire.com, our
primary competitor in the sale of “opaque” travel products.  InterActive has recently announced its
intention to spin-off its on-line travel business into Expedia, which, as a
stand-alone company, would continue to have significantly greater resources and
capital than priceline.com.  We may not
be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerates such as Cendant or
Sabre or Expedia, each of which have access to significantly greater and more
diversified resources than we do.  We may
not be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerates such as Cendant,
Sabre or InterActive Corp., each of which have access to significantly greater
resources and capital than us.

We currently or potentially compete with a
variety of companies with respect to each service we offer. With respect to our
travel services, these competitors include:


•

Internet
travel services such as Expedia, Hotels.com and Hotwire, all of which are owned
by InterActive Corp., Travelocity, which is owned by the Sabre Group and
Cheaptickets, Orbitz.com, ebookers plc and Lodging.com, which are owned by the
Cendant Corporation;

•

traditional
travel agencies;

•

individual
or groups of airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators and other
travel service providers (all of which may provide services by telephone or
through their branded website);

•

on-line
travel search sites such as SideStep.com, Mobissimo.com, Cheapflights.com,
Farechase, Kayak.com, or any substantially similar on-line travel search
business; and

•

operators
of travel industry reservation databases such as Galileo, Worldspan, L.P. and
Amadeus.

Hotwire, which is our primary competitor in
the sale of opaque travel services, provides airline tickets, hotel rooms and
rental car reservations at disclosed prices, although supplier identity and
exact flight times are undisclosed until after the customer agrees to the
purchase.  In addition, Hotwire recently
launched a retail airline ticket offering. 
Since its launch, Hotwire has been successful in establishing itself in
the online travel marketplace through aggressive advertising, which has had the
effect of decreasing our market share in the opaque channel.  If we are unable to effectively compete with
Hotwire, our business, results of operation and financial condition will be
adversely affected.

With respect to financial services,
competitors of pricelinemortgage.com include banks and other financial
institutions and online and traditional mortgage and insurance brokers,
including E*Trade, ditech.com, mortgage.com, Quicken Mortgage, E-Loan, Lending
Tree, which is owned by InterActive Corp., and iOwn, Inc.

We potentially face competition from a number
of large Internet companies and services that have expertise in developing
online commerce and in facilitating Internet traffic, including Amazon.com,
AOL, MSN, Google.com and Yahoo!, who compete with us either directly or
indirectly through affiliations with other e-commerce or off-line companies.
For example, in July 2004, Yahoo! acquired FareChase, a travel
search-engine that searches for fares and hotel rates at travel supplier and
third-party websites, and refers traffic to those sites.  If Yahoo! or other portals decide to refer
significant traffic to travel search engines, it could result in more
competition from supplier websites and higher customer acquisition costs for
third-party sites such as ours.  Other
large companies with strong brand recognition, technical expertise and
experience in Internet commerce could also seek to compete with us. Competition
from these and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, growth in the trend of utilizing
Internet search engines to capture travel demand could require us to invest
additional amounts in on-line search advertising in order to maintain market
share.  In addition, the business of
Active Hotels, which relies upon third-party distribution partners that derive
substantial business from search engines, could be negatively affected if
search engines change their algorithms in a manner that negatively affects such
parties’ search engine ranking.

Many of our current and potential competitors,
including Internet directories, search engines and large traditional retailers,
have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand
recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing, technical and other
resources than priceline.com. Some of these competitors may be able to secure
products and services on more favorable terms than we can. In addition, many of
these competitors may be able to devote significantly greater resources to:

•

marketing
and promotional campaigns;


•

attracting
traffic to their websites;

•

attracting
and retaining key employees;

•

securing
vendors and inventory; and

•

website
and systems development.

In addition, many airline, hotel and rental
car suppliers have begun to focus on driving online demand to their own
websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as us.  Certain suppliers have attempted to charge
additional fees to customers who book airline reservations through an on-line
channel other than their own website. 
Furthermore, many low cost airlines, who are having increasing success
in the marketplace, distribute their inventory exclusively through their own
websites.  Suppliers who sell on their
own websites typically do not charge a processing fee, and, in some instances,
offer advantages such as bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their
offerings more attractive to consumers than models like ours.

Increased competition could result in reduced
operating margins, loss of market share and damage to our brand. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may lose or be
subject to reduction of global distribution system fees

.

We rely on fees paid to us by Worldspan, L.P.
for travel bookings made through Worldspan, L.P.’s global distribution system,
or GDS, for a substantial portion of our gross profit and net income. A number
of travel suppliers, particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as
part of an effort to reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their
dependence over time on what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels
such as GDSs. A number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel
distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the
GDS.  We have agreed to rebate certain
GDS costs to certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such
as those relating to inventory pricing and availability, and expect to continue
to do so in the future.  Additionally,
travel suppliers are encouraging distributors, such as us, to develop technology
enabling direct connections, therefore bypassing the GDS. Development of direct
connection technology would require the use of information technology resources
and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other
projects. We have been and believe that we will continue to be under pressure
from travel suppliers, including most of the major domestic airlines and many
of our significant hotel suppliers, to rebate all or part of the travel booking
fees we receive from Worldspan, L.P. To the extent that we are required to
rebate travel booking fees we currently receive to travel suppliers, and are
unable to recover such amounts by charging customers, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, some airlines are exploring
alternative global distribution methods recently developed by new entrants to
the global distribution marketplace. 
Such new entrants propose using technology that is less complex than
traditional global distribution systems, and that enables the distribution of
airline tickets in a manner than that is more cost-effective to the airline
suppliers.  Our airline suppliers might
pressure us to implement such a distribution system, but our contractual
obligations to Worldspan would limit our ability to do so during the term of
our agreement with Worldspan.  If, as a
result, any of such suppliers reduces or ceases its participation in
priceline.com, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.


Acquisitions could result in operating
difficulties.

As part of our business strategy, we acquired
a substantial majority of Travelweb LLC in May 2004 and acquired all of
the remaining interest in December 2004. In addition, in September 2004,
we acquired Active Hotels Ltd., an online travel company based in the United
Kingdom.  We may enter into additional
business combinations and acquisitions in the future.  Acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances
of equity securities, use of our cash resources, incurrence of debt and
amortization of expenses related to intangible assets.  In addition, the process of integrating an
acquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen operating
difficulties and expenditures.  The
acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels were accompanied by a number of
risks, including:

•

the
need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate
for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked
such controls, procedures and policies;

•

the
difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of Travelweb and Active
Hotels, which are principally located in Dallas, Texas, and Cambridge, England,
respectively, with and into our operations, which are headquartered in Norwalk,
Connecticut;

•

the
potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;

•

the
difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our services
and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;

•

the
failure to further successfully develop acquired technology resulting in the
impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;

•

the
impairment of relationships with customers of Travelweb, Active Hotels or our
own customers as a result of any integration of operations;

•

the
impairment of relationships with employees of Travelweb, Active Hotels or our
own business as a result of any integration of new management personnel;

•

the
potential unknown liabilities associated with Travelweb or Active Hotels.

We may experience similar risks in connection
with any future acquisitions. We may not be successful in addressing these
risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisitions of
Travelweb and Active Hotels or that we could encounter in future acquisitions,
which would harm our business or cause us to fail to realize the anticipated
benefits of our acquisitions.  We currently
have approximately $218 million assigned primarily to the intangible assets and
goodwill of Travelweb and Active Hotels, and therefore, the occurrence of any
of the aforementioned risks could result in a material adverse impact,
including a material impairment of these assets.

Our growth cannot be
assured. Even if we do experience growth, we cannot assure you that we will
grow profitably

.

Our business strategies are dependent on the
growth of our business. For us to achieve significant growth, consumers and
travel suppliers must continue to accept our website as a valuable commercial
tool. Consumers who have historically purchased travel services using
traditional commercial channels, such as local travel agents and calling
suppliers directly, must instead purchase these services on our website.
Similarly, travel suppliers will also need to accept or expand their use of our
website and view our website as an efficient and profitable channel of
distribution for their travel products. Our ability to


enhance awareness of the priceline.com brands
and offer services that will attract and retain a significant number of new
consumers and travel suppliers is not certain, and therefore, our growth may be
limited.

We may not be
successful in entering the retail hotel market.

To date, we have been able to integrate
successfully the sale of retail products for our airline and rental car
services.  We are scheduled to launch a
retail service for our hotel service in the second quarter of 2005.  The launch of our retail service for hotels
is substantially more complex and requires substantially greater financial,
human and development resources than did the launch of either our retail
airline service or retail rental car service. 
There can be no assurance that our retail hotel service will have the
same degree of market acceptance among consumers that our airline and rental
car services have had thus far.  Many of
our competitors have more experience in the retail hotel market than we do, and
have invested significantly more than we have in marketing spend.  In addition, we may face difficulty from our
suppliers in maintaining access to the inventory necessary to sustain a competitive
retail hotel service.  Our failure to
successfully anticipate, identify and react to any of the difficulties we might
face could have an adverse effect on the timing of the launch of our retail
hotel service or our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Travelweb’s business
model exposes us to certain risks that we have not traditionally experienced in
the hotel business.

Travelweb facilitates the purchase of hotel rooms by
customers pursuant to a merchant model, which is based on merchant arrangements
it makes directly with individual hotel chains and independent hotel
properties. Travelweb receives access to inventory directly from a hotel at a
negotiated rate, and determines the retail price at which it will offer its
services to the consumer, within contractual limitations.  Prior to our acquisition of Travelweb in May
2004, we did not have experience with a disclosed-price merchant model hotel
service, and there can be no assurance we will have success with such a model
in the future.

Many hotels use merchant arrangements with companies
like Travelweb to dispose of excess hotel room inventory at wholesale rates. If
hotels experience increased demand for rooms, they might reduce the amount of
room inventory they make available through Travelweb.  The hotel industry has seen a recent
improvement in occupancy rates and this could cause hotels to reduce the amount
of inventory they make available through Travelweb.  Similarly, many hotels distribute room
inventory through their own websites and therefore might increase negotiated
rates for merchant rate inventory sold through Travelweb, decreasing the margin
available to Travelweb.

In addition, Travelweb makes merchant hotel
inventory available to certain affiliate travel distributors, including Orbitz,
Inc.  Such affiliates offer such
inventory to consumers.  If Orbitz or
other affiliates cease distributing Travelweb inventory, or significantly
reduce the amount of Travelweb inventory they offer to consumers, the business
of Travelweb would be negatively impacted. 
The recently-announced acquisition of Orbitz by Cendant is likely to
result in Orbitz reducing, over time, the inventory it seeks from Travelweb,
and non-renewal of Travelweb’s affiliate agreement with Orbitz, which expires
in December of 2005.

Active Hotel’s

business
model exposes us to certain risks that we have not traditionally experienced in
the hotel business.

Active Hotels distributes hotel rooms primarily
through a retail model, whereby it secures a reservation with a customer’s
credit card, but is not compensated by the hotel property until such customer
checks out of the hotel property.  This
requires Active Hotels to pursue collection of commissions relating to hotel
room reservations from the hotel properties after the customer has completed
his or her stay.  We do not have
extensive experience in collecting commissions from hotel


properties
and failure to sustain an adequate collection rate could negatively impact the
business of Active Hotels.

In addition, Active Hotels relies heavily on various
third parties to distribute hotel room reservations, and Active Hotel’s
distribution channels are concentrated among a number of third parties.  Should one or more of such third parties
cease distribution of Active Hotels’ reservations, or suffers a deterioration
in its search engine ranking, its business could be negatively affected.

Historically, the majority of Active Hotels’
business is located in the U.K.  The
strategy of Active Hotels involves rapid expansion into other European
countries, many of which have different customs and different levels of
customer acceptance of the Internet.  If
Active Hotels is unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into other European countries,
our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely
affected.

Our international
operations and additional expansion efforts internationally expose us to
additional risks and may materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Prior
to 2004, substantially all of our revenues were generated within the United
States.  In September 2004, we
acquired Active Hotels, which is based in the United Kingdom and provides us
with access to the European hotel market. 
One of our principal strategies is to continue to grow internationally,
both in Europe and elsewhere.  The
integration of Active Hotels, and any further expansion internationally,
requires and will continue to require substantial management attention and
financial resources.  Our management has
limited to no prior experience integrating and managing international
operations.  Moreover, acquiring or
establishing foreign operations is a significant investment that might not
produce desired results.  For example, we
may experience higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with the
development and maintenance of our business internationally relative to our
domestic experience.

Additionally, like our current
foreign operations, any future acquisitions or expansion internationally would
be subject to risks, including:

•

the impact of
business cycles and downturns in economies outside the United States;

•

longer payment
cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections;

•

time and
resources required to comply with foreign regulatory requirements;

•

trade barriers
and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

•

difficulties and
costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

•

potentially
adverse tax consequences;

•

reduced
protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

•

unanticipated
tax costs associated with the cross-border use of intangible assets;

•

political or
social unrest or economic instability;

•

fluctuations in
currency exchange rates;

•

difficulty in
maintaining effective communications with employees and customers due to
distance, language and cultural barriers;

•

lower brand
recognition for priceline.com and our other brands in foreign countries,
particularly in non-English speaking countries;


•

lower per capita
Internet usage in many foreign countries for a variety of reasons, including
lower disposable incomes, lack of adequate telecommunications and computer
infrastructure and concerns regarding online security for e-commerce transactions;
and

•

competition in
international markets from a broad range of competitors who may have a greater
market share, more established branding, greater knowledge with respect to the
tastes and preferences of customers residing in their country and/or their
focus on a single market.

One or more of these factors
could harm our international operations and expansion efforts, and
consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Defending against intellectual
property claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business.

We cannot assure you that others will not obtain and
assert patents or other intellectual property rights against us affecting
essential elements of our business.  From
time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we have been subject to
legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of
others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual
property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope
of our business.  We endeavor to defend
our intellectual property rights diligently, but intellectual property
litigation is expensive and time consuming, and successful infringement claims
against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from
operating our business, or portions of our business.  In addition, resolution of claims may require
us to obtain licenses to use intellectual property rights belonging to third
parties, which may be expensive to procure, or possibly to cease using those
rights altogether.  Any of these events
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We may not be able
to keep up with rapid technological and other changes.

The markets in which we compete are
characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards,
consolidation, frequent new service and product announcements, introductions
and enhancements and changing consumer demands. We may not be able to keep up
with these rapid changes. In addition, these market characteristics are
heightened by the emerging nature of the Internet and the apparent need of
companies from many industries to offer Internet-based products and services.
As a result, our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly
changing technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and
to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our service
in response to competitive service and product offerings and the evolving
demands of the marketplace. In addition, the widespread adoption of new
Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological
changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt
our services or infrastructure.

Online
security breaches could harm our business.

The secure transmission of confidential
information over the Internet is essential in maintaining consumer and supplier
confidence in the priceline.com service. Substantial or ongoing security
breaches whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other
Internet-based systems could significantly harm our business. We currently
require buyers to guarantee their offers with their credit card, either online
or through our toll-free telephone service. We rely on licensed encryption and
authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential
information, including credit card numbers. It is possible that advances in
computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a
compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer
transaction data.

We incur substantial expense to protect against and remedy security
breaches and their consequences. However, we cannot guarantee that our security
measures will prevent security breaches. A


party (whether
internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party) that is able to
circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information or cause
significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, several major
websites have experienced significant interruptions as a result of improper
direction of excess traffic to those sites, and computer viruses have
substantially disrupted e-mail and other functionality in a number of
countries, including the United States. Security breaches also could damage our
reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.
Security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to
lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the
value of our brand.

Our insurance
policies carry low coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us
for losses caused by security breaches.

Companies that we have acquired, such as
Travelweb and Active Hotels, and that we may acquire in the future, may employ
security and networking standards at levels we find unsatisfactory.  The
process of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved security and network
standards may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and
expertise that are difficult to obtain.  Such acquisitions increase the
number of potential vulnerabilities, and can cause delays in detection of an
attack, as well as the timelines of recovery from any given attack. Failure to
raise any such standards that we find unsatisfactory could expose us to
security breaches that would have an adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We also face risks associated with security
breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet.
Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the Internet,
and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet
and, therefore, the priceline.com service as a means of conducting commercial
transactions.

We
rely on the value of the priceline.com brand, and the costs of maintaining and
enhancing our

brand awareness are increasing.

We believe that maintaining and expanding the
priceline.com brand, and other owned brands, including Lowestfare.com,
Rentalcars.com, Breezenet.com, MyTravelGuide.com, Travelweb and Active Hotels,
are important aspects of our efforts to attract and expand our user and
advertiser base.  As our larger
competitors spend increasingly more on advertising, we are required to spend
more in order to maintain our brand recognition.  Promotion of the priceline.com brand will
depend largely on our success in satisfying our customers. In addition, we have
spent considerable money and resources to date on the establishment and
maintenance of the priceline.com brands, and we will continue to spend money
on, and devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand-building
efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of the priceline.com brands.
We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness of
the priceline.com brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding
efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective. If we are unable to maintain
or enhance customer awareness of the priceline.com brands in a cost-effective
manner, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be
adversely affected.

We issued $125 million of Convertible Senior Notes
due August 2010, which provide for mandatory repayment beginning in 2008
and could result in dilution of our earnings per share.

In August 2003, we issued $125 million aggregate principal amount
of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest rate of
1% (the “1% Notes”).  The 1% Notes are
convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our common stock at the option
of the holder, at a conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject
to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.  Each $1,000 principal amount of 1% Notes will
initially be convertible into 25 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to August 1,
2008, the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the
30 consecutive trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period, as
defined in the offering memorandum related to the 1% Notes, is more than 110%
of the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes, or after August 1, 2008,
if the closing price of our common stock is more than 110% of the then current
conversion price of the 1 % Notes.  The
1% Notes are also convertible in certain other


circumstances set forth in the offering
memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com.  In addition, the 1% Notes will be redeemable
at our option beginning in 2008, and the holders may require us to repurchase
the 1% Notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances.  While we currently have sufficient cash and
short-term investments to repay the 1% Notes, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to repay or refinance the 1% Notes on the repayment date.  In addition, the purchase of the 1% Notes
with shares of our common stock or the conversion of the 1% Notes into our
common stock could result in dilution of our earnings per share.  Further, the adoption by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board of

EITF Issue No. 04-08,

“The Effect of Contingently
Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” which was effective as of December 15,
2004, requires that contingently convertible debt, such as the 1% Notes, be
included in diluted earnings per share, regardless of whether the market price
contingently contained in the debt instrument has been met.  We have historically excluded the potential
dilutive effect of the conversion feature from diluted earnings per share.  The 1% Notes were dilutive to earnings per
share for the full year 2004, but not for 2003.

The adoption of EITF 04-08
required us to include approximately 3,125,000 additional shares of common
stock underlying the 1% Notes and in our diluted earnings per share calculation
in the event that their inclusion is dilutive to earnings per share. The impact
of the additional shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per share is
partially offset by exclusion of coupon interest and amortization of debt
issuance costs associated with the Notes. 
The adoption of EITF 04-08 could result in a material reduction in our
diluted earnings per share in future periods

We issued $100 million of Convertible Senior Notes
due January 15, 2025, which provide for mandatory repayment beginning in
2010 and could result in dilution of our earnings per share.

In June 2004, we issued $100 million aggregate
principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025, with an
interest rate of 2.25% (the “2.25% Notes”). 
The 2.25% Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our
common stock at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of
approximately $37.95 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events.  Each $1,000 principal
amount of 2.25% Notes will initially be convertible into 26.3505 shares of our
common stock if, on or prior to January 15, 2025, certain conditions
occur.  The 2.25% Notes are also
convertible in certain other circumstances set forth in the offering
memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com.  In the event that all or substantially all of
our common stock is acquired prior to January 15, 2010, in a transaction
in which the consideration paid to holders of our common stock consists of all
or substantially all cash, we would be required to make additional payments to
the holders of amounts ranging from $0 to $19.1 million depending upon the date
of the transaction and our then current stock price.  In addition, the 2.25% Notes will be
redeemable at our option beginning January 20, 2010, and the holders may
require us to repurchase the notes on January 15, 2010, 2015 and 2020 or
in certain other circumstances.  While we
currently have sufficient cash and short-term investments to repay the 2.25%
Notes, there can be no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance the
notes on the repayment date.  In
addition, the purchase of our 2.25% Notes with shares of our common stock or the
conversion of the notes into our common stock could result in dilution of our
earnings per share.  Further, the
adoption by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of

EITF Issue No. 04-08,

“The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” which was
effective as of December 15, 2004, requires that contingently convertible
debt, such as the 2.25% Notes, be included in diluted earnings per share,
regardless of whether the market price contingently contained in the debt
instrument has been met.  We have
historically excluded the potential dilutive effect of the conversion feature
from diluted earnings per share.  The
2.25% Notes were not dilutive to earnings per share since their issuance.

The
adoption of EITF 04-08 required us to include approximately 2,635,046 additional
shares of common stock underlying the 2.25% Notes and in our diluted earnings
per share calculation in the event that their inclusion is dilutive to earnings
per share. The impact of the additional shares in the calculation of diluted
earnings per share was offset by exclusion of coupon interest and amortization
of debt issuance costs associated with the Notes.  The adoption of EITF 04-08 could result in a

Our success depends on our ability
to protect our intellectual property.

We regard our intellectual property as critical to
our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret
protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees,
customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. If we are not
successful in protecting our intellectual property, it could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

While we believe that our issued patents and pending
patent applications help to protect our business, there can be no assurance
that:

•

any patent can be successfully defended against challenges by third
parties;

•

pending
patent applications will result in the issuance of patents;

•

competitors or potential competitors of priceline.com
will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our
patents or patent applications;

•

because
of variations in the application of our business model to each of our services,
our patents will be effective in preventing one or more third parties from
utilizing a copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more
categories;

•

new prior art will not be discovered which may diminish the value of or
invalidate an issued patent;

•

a
third party will not have or obtain one or more patents that prevent us from
practicing features of our business or require us to pay for a license to use
those features; or

•

our operations do not or will not infringe valid, enforceable patents of
third parties.

There has been recent discussion in the press
regarding the examination and issuance of so called “business-method” patents.
As a result, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has
indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such
patent applications. The new procedures are not expected to have a direct
effect on patents already granted. We cannot anticipate what effect, if any,
the new review process will have on our pending patent applications.

We pursue the registration of our trademarks and
service marks in the U.S. and internationally. However, effective trademark,
service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in
every country in which our services are made available online. We have licensed
in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary
rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These
licensees may take actions that might diminish the value of our proprietary
rights or harm our reputation.

Our business is dependent upon  third-party
systems and service providers.

We rely on certain third-party computer systems and
third-party service providers, including the computerized central reservation
systems of the airline, hotel and rental car industries to satisfy demand for
airline tickets, hotel room and rental car reservations. In particular, our
travel business is substantially dependent upon the computerized reservation
systems of Worldspan, L.P., and Pegasus Solutions, operators of global
distribution systems for the travel industry. Any interruption in these third-party
services systems, including Worldspan, L.P.’s or Pegasus’ systems, or
deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking airline, hotel
and rental car reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our agreements with third-party service providers are terminable upon short
notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions. In the
event our arrangement with any of such third parties is terminated, we may not
be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely


basis

or on commercially reasonable terms and, as a result, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

A substantial portion of our computer hardware for
operating our services is currently located at a web hosting facility operated
by SAVVIS.  If SAVVIS is, for any reason,
unable to support our website, we would need to quickly complete the activation
of our secondary site at the ATT web hosting facility.  Any of these conditions could cause
disruptions to our business or exposure to potentially damaging press coverage
of the problems, and would have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Our communications infrastructure is provided by
vendors such as AT&T, MCI and IX EUROPE.  If they are unable, for any reason, to support
the communications infrastructure they provide us, instabilities in our systems
could increase until such time as we were able to replace their services.

While we do maintain redundant systems and hosting
services for some of our business, it is possible that we could experience an
interruption in our business, and we do not carry business interruption
insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.

Capacity constraints and system
failures could harm our business.

We rely on the global distribution system of
Worldspan, L.P. in the sale of airline tickets, opaque hotel room reservations,
and rental car reservations, and the global distribution system of Pegasus
Solutions in the sale of retail hotel room reservations.  We do not have a back-up GDS and if the
Worldspan or Pegasus GDS becomes inaccessible, or partially inaccessible to us,
due to system failure or otherwise, for any significant amount of time, our
ability to book airline tickets, opaque and retail hotel reservations and
rental car reservations would be adversely affected, and our results would
suffer.  We also depend upon Paymentech
for our production fulfillment processes. If Paymentech was wholly or partially
compromised, our cash flows could be disrupted until such a time as a
replacement process could be put in place with a different vendor.

A substantial amount of our computer hardware for
operating our services is currently located at the facilities of SAVVIS in New
Jersey and IX EUROPE in London, England. These systems and operations are
vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, floods, fires, power
loss, telecommunication failures and similar events. They are also subject to
break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct.
Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or
other unanticipated problems at the SAVVIS facility or the IX EUROPE facility
could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. In addition, the failure
by SAVVIS or IX EUROPE to provide our required data communications capacity
could result in interruptions in our service. Any system failure that causes an
interruption in service or decreases the responsiveness of the priceline.com
service could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If our systems cannot be expanded to cope with
increased demand or fails to perform, we could experience:

•

unanticipated disruptions in service;

•

slower response times;

•

decreased
customer service and customer satisfaction; or

•

delays in the introduction of new products and services,


any

of which could impair our reputation, damage the priceline.com brand
and materially and adversely affect our revenues. Publicity about a service
disruption also could cause a material decline in our stock price.

Like many online businesses, we have experienced system
failures from time to time. For example, in May 2001, our primary website
was interrupted for a period of 12 hours. In addition to placing increased
burdens on our engineering staff, these outages create a significant amount of
user questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support
personnel. Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an
immediate loss of revenues that can be substantial and may cause some users to
switch to our competitors. If we experience frequent or persistent system
failures, our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. We have been
taking steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system. These
steps are expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing
the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.

We use both internally developed systems and
third-party systems to operate the priceline.com service, including transaction
processing, order management and financial systems that were designed to be
scaleable and stable. However, if the number of users of our services increases
substantially, or if critical third-party systems stop operating as designed,
we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology, transaction
processing systems, financial systems and other infrastructure. We do not know
whether we will be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to
accommodate such conditions in a timely manner.

Companies that we have
acquired, such as Travelweb and Active Hotels, and that we may acquire in the
future, may present known or unknown capacity/stability or other types of
system challenges.

The process of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved
capacity/scalability and other system characteristics may be time consuming and
expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to
obtain.  Such acquisitions increase potential downtime, customer facing
problems and compliance problems. 
Failure to successfully make any such improvements to such
infrastructures could expose us to potential capacity, stability, and system
problems that would have an adverse impact on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

Uncertainty
regarding payment of sales and hotel occupancy taxes

.

On an ongoing basis, we conduct reviews and
interpretations of the tax laws in various states and other jurisdictions
relating to the payment of state and local hotel occupancy and other related
taxes.  In connection with our reviews, we
have met and had discussions with taxing authorities in certain jurisdictions
but the ultimate resolution in any particular jurisdiction cannot be determined
at this time.  Currently, hotels collect
and remit hotel occupancy and related taxes to the various tax authorities
based on the amounts collected by the hotels. Consistent with this practice, we
recover the taxes on the underlying cost of the hotel room night from customers
and remit the taxes to the hotel operators for payment to the appropriate tax
authorities. Several jurisdictions have indicated that they may take the
position that hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the
price paid by a customer for our service and the cost to us of the underlying
room. Historically, we have not collected taxes on this differential. Some
state and local jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to sales or
hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to collect such
taxes, either retroactively or prospectively or both. Such actions may result
in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and could have a material adverse
effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent that any tax
authority succeeds in asserting that any such tax collection responsibility
exists, it is likely that, with respect to future transactions, we would
collect any such additional tax obligation from our customers, which would have
the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room nights to our customers and,
consequently, could reduce our hotel sales. We will continue to assess the
risks of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the
extent appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.


Uncertainty
regarding state and local taxes

.

We file tax returns in such states as required by
law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we
pay sales and other taxes to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold
through the priceline.com service. In certain cases, where appropriate, we
remit taxes directly to the tax authorities. We believe that this practice is
consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions. However, one or more states
could seek to impose additional income tax obligations, sales tax collection
obligations or other tax obligations on companies, such as ours, which engage
in or facilitate online commerce. A number of proposals have been made at state
and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and
services through the Internet or the income derived from these sales.  To the extent that any tax authority succeeds
in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions
conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have additional tax
exposure.  Such actions could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We will continue to assess the risks of the
potential financial impact of additional tax exposure, and to the extent
appropriate, we will reserve for those estimates of liabilities.

Current economic conditions in the United States are
triggering active consideration on ways to generate additional tax revenues by
both the federal and state and local governments. We cannot predict what
changes in tax law or interpretations of such laws may be adopted or assure
that such changes or interpretations would not materially impact our business.

We are exposed to fluctuations in
currency exchange rates.

As a result of our acquisition of Active Hotels, we
will conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the
United States but will report our results in U.S. dollars.  As a result, we will face exposure to adverse
movements in currency exchange rates.  In
addition, the results of operations of Active Hotels are exposed to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of Active Hotels are
translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation.  If the U.S. dollar weakens against the
local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated
transactions will result in increased net revenues, operating expenses, and net
income.  Similarly, our net revenues,
operating expenses, and net income will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens
against local currency.

Our business is exposed to risks
associated with credit card fraud and charge-backs.

To date, our results have been negatively impacted
by purchases made using fraudulent credit cards. Because we act as the
merchant-of-record in a majority of our transactions, we may be held liable for
accepting fraudulent credit cards on our website as well as other payment
disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting
fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as
merchant of record.  Accordingly, we
calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge-backs.  If we are unable to combat the use of
fraudulent credit cards on our website, our business, results of operations and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Two large stockholders
beneficially own approximately 33% of our stock.

Hutchison Whampoa Limited and its 49.97%
shareholder, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, collectively beneficially owned
approximately 33% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2004,
based on public filings with the SEC. Together, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited
and Hutchison Whampoa Limited have appointed three of the eleven members of our
Board of Directors. As a result of their ownership and positions, Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited and Hutchison Whampoa Limited collectively are able to
significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including
the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Such
concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a
change in control of our company. In addition, both Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Limited and Hutchison Whampoa Limited have registration rights with respect to
their shares of priceline.com.  On May 4,
2004, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission


a
shelf registration statement covering, among other things, up to 10 million
shares of our common stock held by Hutchison Whampoa Limited and Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Limited.  The shelf
registration statement was declared effective on May 20, 2004, and therefore,
there can be no assurance that Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited, Hutchison
Whampoa Limited, or both, will not dispose of all or substantially all of our
common stock held by them at any time. Sales of significant amounts of shares
held by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited or Hutchison Whampoa Limited, or the
prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.

Fluctuations in our financial
results make quarterly comparisons and financial forecasting difficult.

Our revenues and operating results have varied
significantly from quarter to quarter because our business experiences seasonal
fluctuations, which reflect seasonal trends for the travel services offered by
our websites. Traditional leisure travel bookings in the United States are
higher in the second and third calendar quarters of the year as consumers take
spring and summer vacations. In the first and fourth quarters of the calendar
year, demand for travel services in the United States generally declines and
the number of bookings flattens.  Travel
bookings in Europe, on the other hand, are higher in the third and fourth
quarters than in the first and second quarters. 
Our results may also be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the
inventory made available to us by airlines, hotels and rental car suppliers.
Our revenues and operating results may continue to vary significantly from quarter
to quarter because of these factors. As a result, quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful. In
addition, due to our limited operating history, a relatively new and unproven
business model and an uncertain environment in the travel industry, it may be
difficult to predict our future revenues or results of operations.

Because of these fluctuations and uncertainties, our
operating results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and
investors. If this happens, the trading price of our common stock would almost
certainly be materially adversely affected.

If we lose our key personnel or
cannot recruit additional personnel, our business may suffer.

We depend on the continued services and performance
of our executive officers and other key personnel. These individuals have
acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to priceline.com and our
operations. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. Our ability to
retain key employees could be materially adversely affected by the decline in
the market price of our common stock, limitations on our ability to pay cash
compensation that is equivalent to cash paid by traditional businesses or, in
some instances, larger or better capitalized competitors, and limitations
imposed by our employee benefit plans on our ability to issue additional equity
incentives. If we do not succeed in attracting new employees or retaining and
motivating current and future employees or executive officers, our business
could suffer significantly.


The adoption by FASB of FASB
Statement No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” will negatively impact
our reported business results

.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB
Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123 (R)”), “Share-Based Payment”, which
is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”  SFAS 123(R) eliminates
the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and requires that such
transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method and recognized as
expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  SFAS 123(R) allows the modified prospective
method to be used, which requires that the fair value of new awards granted
from the beginning of the year of adoption (plus unvested awards at the date of
adoption) be expensed over the vesting term. 
We will be required to apply SFAS 123(R) as of July 1, 2005.  SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on
our Consolidated Statement of Operations as we will be required to expense the
fair value of our stock option grants rather than disclose the impact on our
consolidated operations within our footnotes. 
Upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), the impact of unvested stock options
granted as of December 31, 2004 is estimated to increase personnel expense
by $3.9 million in 2005, $6.6 million in 2006 and $1.8 million in 2007.

It is possible that our financial
results will be materially impacted by income taxes in the future.

We have historically incurred cumulative net
operating losses (“NOL’s”) for financial accounting and tax purposes.  The effects of the NOL’s have given rise to a
substantial deferred tax asset that has been utilized to offset the provision
for income taxes on substantially all earnings generated to date within the
United States.  SFAS No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes”, requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.”  At December 31, 2004, we
have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax
asset.   If, in the future, we determine
that it is more likely than not that we will generate sustainable pre-tax net
income within the United States in an amount that allows us to utilize our
deferred tax asset, we will be required to reverse all or a portion of the
deferred tax asset valuation allowance. 
If we reverse any part of the valuation allowance, our reported
financial results for the period during which we reverse the valuation
allowance would be positively impacted in an amount equal to the dollar amount
of the valuation allowance reversal and our Consolidated Balance Sheets would
reflect the revised carrying value of our deferred tax asset.  In reporting periods subsequent to the
reversal of our valuation allowance, our reported financial results would
include a provision for income taxes based upon the full prevailing blended
federal and state tax rates.   While such
a provision is expected to be substantially non-cash in nature, our future
reported net income and earnings per share would be materially negatively
impacted.

The use of our deferred tax asset is also subject to
limitation under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Section 382 imposes limitations on the
use of company’s deferred tax assets in the event that a 50-percentage point
ownership change occurs in the shareholdings of our common stock.  As a result of a study (the “NOL Study”), it
was determined that ownership changes occurred in 2000 and 2002 that had the
effect of limiting the amount of deferred tax asset that can be used to offset
future taxable income to approximately $69 million annually over the
carryforward period.  The estimate of the
value of the tax asset is based upon certain conclusions in the NOL Study
pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the Company
on the dates of the ownership changes. 
The conclusions contained in the NOL Study are subject to
interpretation, and therefore, the value of the deferred tax asset could be
subject to change.  The value of the
deferred tax asset could also be materially impaired in the event that another
change of control occurs.

Our stock price is highly
volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly
volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in
response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our
control:


•

quarterly variations in our operating results;

•

operating
results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;

•

changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including
financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;

•

changes in our capital structure;

•

changes in market valuations of other Internet or online service companies;

•

announcements of technological innovations or new services
by us or our competitors;

•

announcements by us or our competitors of significant
contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

•

loss of a major supplier participant, such as an airline or hotel chain;

•

changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;

•

lack
of success in the expansion of our business model geographically;

•

announcements by third parties of significant claims or
proceedings against us or adverse developments in pending proceedings;

•

additions or departures of key personnel; and

•

stock market price and volume fluctuations.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our
common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by
introducing a large number of sellers to the market. Given the volatility that
exists for our shares, such sales could cause the market price of our common
stock to decline significantly. In addition, fluctuations in our stock price
and our price-to-earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to
momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of
stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction,
particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis.

The trading prices of Internet company stocks in
general, including ours, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations. To the extent that the public’s perception of the prospects of
Internet or e-commerce companies is negative, our stock price could decline
further, regardless of our results. Other broad market and industry factors may
decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating
performance. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic
conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations,
also may decrease the market price of our common stock.  Negative market conditions could adversely
affect our ability to raise additional capital.

We are defendants in a number of securities class
action litigations. In the past, securities class action litigation often has
been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market
price of its securities. To the extent our stock price declines or is volatile,
we may in the future be the target of additional litigation. This additional
litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention
and resources.


Legal Proceedings

We are a party to the legal proceedings described in
Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.  The defense of the actions described in Note
19 may increase our expenses and an adverse outcome in any of such actions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

Regulatory and legal uncertainties
could harm our business.

The products and services we offer through the
priceline.com service are regulated by federal and state governments. Our
ability to provide such products and services is and will continue to be
affected by such regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or
unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory
bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs, cause the
development of the affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.  See “

Uncertainty regarding payment of sales and hotel
occupancy and other related taxes

.”

Item 2.

Properties

Our executive, administrative, operating offices and
network operations center are located in approximately 92,000 square feet of
leased office space located in Norwalk, Connecticut. Our call center is located
in Columbus, Ohio, where we currently lease approximately 12,000 square feet of
office and warehouse space. 
Priceline.com europe Ltd. leases approximately
290 square feet of storage space in Staines, England. Travelweb leases
approximately 19,000 square feet of office space in Dallas, Texas.  Active Hotels leases approximately 15,000
square feet of office space primarily in Cambridge, England. We do not own any
real estate as of March 11, 2005.

We believe that our existing facilities are adequate
to meet our current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute
space will be available as needed to accommodate any further expansion of
corporate operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

On December 30, 2004, the City of Los Angeles
filed a putative class action complaint in Superior Court for the County of Los
Angeles, on behalf of itself and other allegedly similarly situated cities in
California, naming as defendants: 
Hotels.com, L.P.; Hotels.Com GP., LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets,
Inc.; Cendant Travel Distribution Services Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.;
Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com); Lowestfare.com, Inc.;
Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz, Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; priceline.com, Inc.; Site59.com,
LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.; Travelocity.com LP; Travelweb, LLC; Travelnow.com,
Inc.  (

City of Los
Angeles v. Hotels.com, Inc. et al

.) The complaint alleges, among
other things, that each of these defendants violated the Uniform Transient
Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of Los Angeles, and allegedly similar
ordinances of other California cities, with respect to the charging and
remittance of amounts to cover taxes under such ordinances, and that such


violations

also constitute acts of unfair competition
under California Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq. (“Section 17200”).  The complaint seeks payment of alleged unpaid
taxes owed, relief from conversion, including punitive damages, and imposition
of a constructive trust.  As of March 1,
2005, neither we nor our wholly owned subsidiaries, Lowestfare.com and
Travelweb had been served with the complaint.

On February 17, 2005, a putative class action
complaint was filed in the same court by Ronald Bush and three other
individuals on behalf of themselves and other allegedly similarly situated
California consumers against several of the same defendants as named in the
City of Los Angeles action, including us (

Bush et al. v. Cheaptickets, Inc.
et al

.)  The complaint alleges each
of the defendants engaged in acts of unfair competition in violation of Section 17200
relating to their respective disclosures and charging customers to cover taxes
under the above ordinances of City of Los Angeles and other California cities,
and service fees.  The complaint seeks
restitution under Section 17200, relief for alleged conversion, including
punitive damages, injunctive relief, and imposition of a constructive
trust.  We were served with the complaint
on or about February 25, 2005.  It
is anticipated that the court will extend the time in which to respond to the
complaint pending a determination of whether the case should be designated as a
“complex” case and/or transferred to a different division of the court.

Also on February 17, 2005, a putative class
action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of Delaware for New Castle
County by Jeanne Marshall and three other individuals on behalf of themselves
and a putative class of allegedly similarly situated consumers nationwide
against us.  The complaint alleges that
we violated the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, Del. Code Ann. Tit. 6, § 2523
relating to our disclosures and charging customers to cover taxes under city
hotel occupancy tax ordinances nationwide, and service fees.  The complaint seeks damages, including
punitive damages, injunctive relief, and imposition of a constructive
trust.  We were served with the complaint
on March 2, 1005. An answer or motion responsive to the complaint
currently is due on or before March 22, 2005.

We intend to defend vigorously against these
actions.  We are unable at this time to
predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably estimate a range of possible
loss, if any.

On March 16, March 26, April 27, and June 5,
2001, respectively, four putative class action complaints were filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York naming priceline.com,
Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
& Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston
Robertson Stephens, Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ.
2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ. 3590 and 01 Civ. 4956).  Shives

et
al

. v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

., 01 Civ. 4956, also names other defendants and states
claims unrelated to us.  The complaints
allege, among other things, that priceline.com and the individual defendants
violated the federal securities laws by issuing and selling priceline.com
common stock in priceline.com’s March 1999 initial public offering without
disclosing to investors that some of the underwriters in the offering,
including the lead underwriters, had allegedly solicited and received excessive
and undisclosed commissions from certain investors.  By Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge
Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these cases were consolidated for
pre-trial purposes with hundreds of other cases, which contain allegations
concerning the allocation of shares in the initial public offerings of
companies other than priceline.com, Inc. 
By Order of Judge Scheindlin dated August 14, 2001, the following
cases were consolidated for all purposes: 
01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ. 3590.  On April 19, 2002, plaintiffs filed a
Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these cases.  This Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint makes similar allegations to those described above but with respect
to both our March 1999 initial public offering and our August 1999
second public offering of common stock. 
The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock, Jay
S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman, Timothy G. Brier, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest to
BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  Priceline,
Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier,
together with other issuer defendants in the


consolidated

litigation, filed a joint motion to dismiss
on July 15, 2002.  On November 18,
2002, the cases against the individual defendants were dismissed without
prejudice and without costs.  In
addition, counsel for plaintiffs and the individual defendants executed
Reservation of Rights and Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes of
limitations on plaintiffs’ claims against those individuals.  On February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin
issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the issuers’
motion.  None of the claims against us
were dismissed.  On June 26, 2003,
counsel for the plaintiff class announced that they and counsel for the issuers
had agreed to the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”) to
settle claims against the issuers.  The
terms of that Memorandum provide that class members will be guaranteed $1
billion dollars in recoveries by the insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants will assign to the class
members certain claims that they may have against the underwriters.  Issuers also agree to limit their abilities
to bring certain claims against the underwriters.  If recoveries in excess of $1 billion dollars
are obtained by the class from any non-settling defendants, the settling
defendants’ monetary obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any
amount recovered from the underwriters that is less than $1 billion will be
paid by the insurers on behalf of the issuers. 
The Memorandum, which is subject to the approval of each issuer, was
approved by a special committee of our Board of Directors on Thursday, July 3,
2003.  Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff
class and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form of a Stipulation and
Agreement of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and Individuals (“Settlement
Agreement”).  The Settlement Agreement
implements the MOU and contains the same material provisions.  On June 11, 2004, a special committee of
our Board of Directors authorized our counsel to execute the Settlement
Agreement on our behalf.  The Settlement
Agreement is subject to final approval by the Court and the process to obtain
that approval is still pending.

Subsequent to our announcement on September 27,
2000 that revenues for the third quarter 2000 would not meet expectations, we
were served with the following putative class action complaints:



All of these cases have been assigned to Judge
Dominick J. Squatrito.  On September 12,
2001, Judge Squatrito ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master
File No. 3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead
plaintiffs’ counsel.  On October 29,
2001, plaintiffs served a Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On February 5, 2002, Amerindo Investment
Advisors, Inc., who was one of the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action,
made a motion for leave to withdraw as lead plaintiff.  The Court granted that motion on May 30,
2002.  On February 28, 2002, we
filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint.  On October 7, 2004, the Court issued a
Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying, in part, our
motion.  A scheduling order was entered
by the Court on November 2, 2004 and the parties are now proceeding with
discovery.  Plaintiffs filed a motion for
class certification on January 7, 2005, to which our opposition is due on April 8,
2005.  We intend to defend vigorously
against this action.  We are unable to
predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably estimate a range of possible
loss, if any.

In addition, on November 1, 2000 we were served
with a complaint that purported to be a shareholder derivative action against
our Board of Directors and certain of our current and former executive
officers, as well as us (as a nominal defendant).  The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary
duty and waste of corporate assets.  The
action is captioned Mark Zimmerman v. Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D. Schulman,
P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney, W. Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N. Peretsman,
and priceline.com Incorporated, 18473-NC (Court of Chancery of Delaware, County
of New Castle, State of Delaware).  On February 6,
2001, all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to make a
demand upon the Board of Directors and failure to state a cause of action upon
which relief can be granted.  Pursuant to
a stipulation by the parties, an amended complaint was filed on June 21,
2001.  Defendants renewed their motion to
dismiss on August 20, 2001, and plaintiff served his opposition to that
motion on October 26, 2001. 
Defendants filed their reply brief on January 7, 2002.  On December 20, 2002, the Court granted
defendants’ motion without prejudice.  On
April 25, 2003, a second amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was filed
and a motion seeking leave of court to file the second amended complaint was
filed on July 28, 2003.  That motion
has been fully briefed.  The Court has
yet to rule on the motion; oral argument is presently being scheduled.  We intend to defend vigorously against this
action.  We are unable to predict the
outcome of the suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On November 7, 2003, we were served with a
complaint that purported to be a shareholder derivative action against our
Board of Directors and certain of our current and former executive officers, as
well as us (as a nominal defendant).  The
complaint alleged, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and misappropriation of corporate
information.  The claims in the complaint
appear to be substantially repetitive of the claims pending in the derivative
action in Delaware which is described below. 
The action is captioned Don Powell v. Richard S. Braddock, Jay S.
Walker, Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney,
William E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and
Heidi G. Miller and priceline.com Incorporated (Superior Court, Judicial
District of Stamford/Norwalk, State of Connecticut).  On January 28, 2004, defendants
Blackney, Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb moved to dismiss the complaint for lack
of personal jurisdiction.  On January 29,
2004, defendant Miller moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction and for insufficient service of process.  On February 27, 2004, defendants
Braddock, Walker, Schulman, Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Loeb, Nicholas,
Peretsman, Miller and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman also moved to
dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient
service of process.  At a hearing on May
3, 2004, the Court stated that it would not rule on the pending motions until
the pending motions in the Delaware action described above are decided.  The Court conducted a subsequent status
conference on January 10, 2005 at which it requested that the parties
report back no later than March 15, 2005 on the status of the Delaware
derivative suit.  We intend to defend
vigorously against this action.  We are
unable to predict the outcome of this suit or reasonably estimate a range of
possible loss, if any.


On January 6, 1999, we received notice that a
third party patent applicant and patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston,
purportedly had filed in December 1998 with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office a request to declare an interference between a patent
application filed by Woolston and our U.S. Patent 5,794,207.  We are currently awaiting information from
the Patent Office regarding whether it will initiate an interference
proceeding.

From time to time, we have been and expect to
continue to be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of business, including claims of alleged infringement of third party
intellectual property rights by us.  Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from our
business objectives and could adversely affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
Holders

No matters were submitted for a vote of stockholders
of priceline.com during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31,
2004.


PART II

Item 5.

Market for the Registrant’s Common Stock and
Related Stockholder Matters

Price Range of Common Stock

Our common stock has been quoted on the Nasdaq
National Market under the symbol “PCLN” since our initial public offering on March 29,
1999. Prior to such time, there was no public market for our common stock. The
following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sales
prices per share of the common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market,
adjusted to take into account the one-for-six reverse stock split implemented
in June 2003:

Holders

As of March 1, 2005, there were approximately
1,174 stockholders of record of priceline.com’s common stock, although we
believe that there are a significantly larger number of beneficial owners.

Dividend Policy

We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on
our capital stock since our inception and do not expect to pay any cash
dividends for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future
earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Under the terms of
the certificate of designation relating to our Series B Preferred Stock, we
cannot issue any dividends on shares of our common stock unless full cumulative
dividends have been paid on the Series B Preferred Stock for all dividend
periods ending on or prior to the proposed date of payment of a dividend on our
common stock.

In connection with the 1% Convertible Senior Notes
due August 1, 2010, in November 2003, we entered into an interest
rate swap agreement which effectively converts the interest on approximately
$45 million of our debt from a fixed rate to a variable rate.


Issuance of Warrants

In March 2003, in connection with the renewal
of a marketing agreement with Marriott International, Inc., we issued Marriott
833,333 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at $9.84 per
share.  The warrants, which are not
transferable, are fully vested, non-forfeitable, and will be exercisable no
earlier than three years from the date of issuance (subject to certain limited
exceptions in the event of a reorganization, recapitalization, merger or
consolidation involving priceline.com). 
In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we recorded a charge in
the first quarter of 2003 of approximately $6.6 million, or $(0.17) of earnings
per share.

On January 29, 2002, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”)
notified us that they were exercising warrants to purchase 666,667 shares of
priceline.com common stock. The warrants were issued to Delta in February 2001
in connection with Delta’s exchange of priceline.com Series A
Convertible Redeemable PIK Preferred Stock for Series B Redeemable Preferred
Stock. As required by the terms of the warrants, Delta exercised the warrants
by surrendering 11,875 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. As
a result, on January 29, 2002, after giving effect to the exercise of the
warrants, there were 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding
having an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million.
As a result of this exercise, the Series B Preferred Stock will pay dividends
of approximately 40,240 shares of priceline.com common stock semi-annually. In
connection with the sale of the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants, we
relied upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See
Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, Delta holds warrants that provide for
an exercise price of $17.81 per share (the “Delta Warrants”).  Delta may exercise the Delta Warrants only by
surrendering shares of our Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.  If, however, the closing sales price of our
common stock has exceeded $53.44 (subject to adjustment) for 20 consecutive
trading days, the Delta Warrants will automatically be exercised.  In such event, the exercise price will be
paid by surrendering shares of Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock.  The Delta Warrants are exercisable at any
time prior to February 6, 2007. 
Please see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information about the Delta Warrants.

Delta also holds warrants to purchase 779,166 shares
of our common stock at an exercise price of $28.31 per share.  These warrants became exercisable in November 2004.

During July 1999, we issued to Continental
Airlines a warrant to purchase common stock that became exercisable in July 2004.  The warrant grants Continental the right to
purchase a total of 166,666 shares of priceline.com common stock at an exercise
price of $359.58.

In November 1999, we entered into separate
Participation Warrant Agreements with certain domestic airlines relating to
their inclusion in our leisure airline ticket service. Under the Participation
Warrant Agreements, the airlines were granted warrants to purchase a total of
approximately 2.2 million shares of priceline.com common stock at exercise
prices ranging from $315.75 to $359.58 per share. All warrants were fully
vested on the date of grant, and are generally exercisable until their
expiration in May 2005.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

Information required by Part II, Item 5, relating to
Equity Compensation Plan Information will be included in our Proxy Statement
relating to our 2005 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after the end of our fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004.

Overview

General

.  We are a leading online travel
company that offers our customers a broad range of travel services, including
airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacation packages and cruises.  We offer our customers a unique choice: the
ability to purchase certain travel services in a traditional, price-disclosed
manner or the opportunity to use our unique

Name
Your Own Price

®

service, which allows our customers to
make offers for travel services at discounted prices.  At present, we derive substantially all of
our revenues from the following sources:

•

Transaction revenues from our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline ticket, hotel room and rental car
services, as well as our vacation packages service;

•

Customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of both

Name Your Own Price

®

and
price-disclosed airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars service;

•

Commissions primarily related to the sale of price-disclosed hotel
rooms, including those sold in Europe by our subsidiary Active Hotels, rental
cars, cruises and other travel services;

•

Worldspan reservation booking fees related to both our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket, hotel room and rental car service, and price-disclosed airline tickets
and rental car service;

•

Transaction revenue from our price-disclosed hotel room service,
facilitated principally through our wholly-owned subsidiary Travelweb LLC; and

•

Other revenues derived primarily from selling advertising on our
websites.

Trends

.  Our overall financial prospects
have been and continue to be significantly dependent upon the sale of leisure
airline tickets and, as a result, the health of our business has been directly
related to the health of the airline industry. 
Most domestic airlines, and many of our major suppliers, have
experienced, and continue to experience, significant losses.  These losses have been compounded by
competition from low-cost carriers and, most recently, by high fuel prices,
which we believe increase the possibility of the additional bankruptcy and/or
the liquidation of one or more of the major domestic airlines.  As a result of these and other factors, many
of the major airlines have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to maintain
market share, simplified fare structures by removing restrictions associated
with certain retail airline tickets and, as discussed in more detail in “

Other

” below, put pressure on third-party
intermediaries like us to reduce airline distribution costs.  These actions have had, and continue to have,
a detrimental effect on our overall airline business and, in particular, our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket service, which represents a significant portion of our total airline
ticket revenues.


Deep retail discounting by the airlines negatively
affects demand for our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service because it hurts our value proposition and makes users
less willing to accept the trade-offs associated with our service for what has
become, in many cases, modest fare savings. 
In addition, decreased airline capacity hurts our business by reducing
the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our cost of
inventory.  Customer offer prices have
not kept pace with the increase in our cost of inventory and are, therefore,
lower in proportion to our average cost of supply, which has, for the better
part of the last two years, materially and negatively affected the number of

Name Your Own Price

®

tickets
sold.

In addition, in early 2005, several major airline
carriers simplified their retail fare structures, which removed or reduced the
restrictions placed on certain fares (for example, certain airlines, such as
Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, eliminated certain “Saturday-night-stay”
requirements and reduced certain cancellation/change fees) and reduced the
prices of their most expensive fares. 
These fare restructurings negatively affected our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket service in the same manner as retail discounting — they hurt our value
proposition and make users less willing to accept the trade-offs associated
with our

Name Your Own Price

®

service.

Despite the trends associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
ticket service, the online travel sector, overall, continues to grow, and in
the last two years, we have embarked on a strategy to more broadly participate
in that growth by expanding our service offerings and markets.  In an effort to participate in that growth
and counter some of the trends described above, we have taken a number of
initiatives to diversify our service offerings. 
We have taken and expect to continue to take steps to diversify our
revenue among “non-opaque” services, such as by allowing our customers to
purchase price disclosed retail airline, hotel and rental car travel services,
which we believe will help broaden our customer appeal.  To this end, in the fourth quarter of 2003,
we began offering customers the ability to purchase airline tickets at
disclosed, retail prices.  We believe
that the results of the launch of our retail airline ticket service, and the
related marketing effort, have been positive and total unit sales of airline
tickets increased in 2004 for the first time in two years.  The launch of a retail airline service has
also had a positive effect on gross profit contribution.  While some customers presented with a display
of low disclosed prices may opt to select such a ticket or make a lower offer
for a

Name Your Own Price

®

ticket, we believe the gross profit contribution from the increased sale of
retail airline tickets has, to date, more than offset any loss in the number of

Name Your Own Price

®

tickets sold.

As part of our strategy to broaden the appeal of our
hotel service and lessen our dependence on our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline ticket service, we have invested
in and focused our marketing efforts on our non-airline travel services,
including, in particular, our hotel business. 
In 2004, Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all of
the equity interest in Travelweb.  We
intend to use inventory from Travelweb to launch a price disclosed hotel
service on the priceline.com site in the first half of 2005.  Our intent is to provide customers
maximum flexibility by allowing them to select a retail price disclosed
itinerary or to make use of the

Name Your
Own Price

®

service.

Additionally, in September 2004, we acquired
Active Hotels.  We believe the
acquisition creates opportunities for us to expand our businesses.  For example, Active Hotels has longstanding
distribution relationships with a significant number of other European travel
sites and we intend to support these relationships by providing access to U.S.
travel services.  In addition, we believe
that we can offer Active Hotels’ services to our U.S. customer base for
European travel.

We also intend to continue to develop our other
non-air business, in particular our rental car and vacation package businesses,
for which demand remains relatively strong. 
In May 2004, we launched a new retail rental car search and booking engine
on Rentalcars.com, and in June 2004, we implemented that functionality on
Breezenet.com.  In October 2004, we
launched this search and booking engine on priceline.com to allow customers to
choose between an opaque or a disclosed rental car offering.  In addition, in the second quarter of 2004,
we implemented a new feature on our vacation packages path that allows
customers to choose between an “opaque” or a disclosed price flight
itinerary.  We currently offer


vacation

package purchasers the opportunity to purchase tickets, transfers,
tours, discounted restaurant meals and other services available at their travel
destinations.  We intend to expand this
offering to other service paths.  We sell
advertising to travel suppliers and others on our owned websites, including
www.priceline.com, www.lowestfare.com,
www.travelweb.com, www.rentalcars.com, www.breezenet.com and
www.mytravelguide.com, a travel information site acquired in 2004 and
relaunched with upgraded content in early 2005.

With respect to our mortgage service, which is offered on our website through a joint-venture and
described above in Item 1. Business – Products and Services – Financial
Services, interest rates have increased from recent lows, which has resulted in
a slowdown in home refinancings and a reduction in the number of loans that
pricelinemortgage.com originates.  A
reduction in loan originations negatively affects the results of
pricelinemortgage.com and if this trend continues, our results attributable to
pricelinemortgage.com could be significantly impacted.

Further terrorist attacks, hostilities in the Middle
East or elsewhere, the liquidation of major domestic airlines now in
bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our
system of a major airline or hotel supplier, could adversely affect our
business and results of operations and impair our ability to effectively
implement all or some of the initiatives described above.

Other

.  A number of travel suppliers,
particularly airlines, have indicated publicly that, as part of an effort to
reduce distribution costs, they intend to reduce their dependence over time on
what they view to be “expensive” distribution channels such as global
distribution systems (GDSs).  A number of
travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require
rebates of all or part of the fees received from the GDS.  We have agreed to rebate certain GDS costs to
certain suppliers in exchange for contractual considerations such as those
relating to inventory pricing and availability, and expects
to continue to do so in the future. 
Additionally, travel suppliers are encouraging third-party travel
intermediaries, such as us, to develop technology enabling direct connections
to bypass the GDS.  Development of direct
connection technology would require the use of information technology resources
and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other
projects.  We have been and believe that
we will continue to be under significant pressure from travel suppliers,
including most of the major domestic airlines and many of our significant hotel
suppliers, to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from
Worldspan, L.P., our GDS, and to significantly reduce or eliminate their
distribution costs.  To the extent that
we are required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive from our GDS
to travel suppliers, and are unable to recover such amounts by charging
customers, or, if one or a number of travel suppliers pull out of our service
because they are unhappy with existing distribution costs, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We believe that our success will depend in large
part on our ability to maintain profitability, primarily from our leisure
travel business, to continue to promote the priceline.com brand and, over time,
to offer other travel services on our website. We intend to continue to invest
in marketing and promotion, technology and personnel within parameters
consistent with attempts to improve operating results.  We also intend to broaden the scope of our
business, and to that end, we explore strategic alternatives from time to time
in the form of, among other things, mergers and acquisitions.  Our goal is to improve volume and sustain
gross margins in an effort to maintain profitability. The uncertain environment
described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult,
and accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain revenue
growth and profitability.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial
Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of our


accounting

policies are particularly important to our
financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult
and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of
matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying those policies, our
management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be
used in the determination of certain estimates. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to the items described below.
Those estimates are based on, among other things, historical experience, terms
of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions.  A summary of our
significant accounting policies, as well as the estimates and judgments
involved, is set forth below:

•

Refunds.

In very limited circumstances, we make certain accommodations for
customers or provide refunds to customers. Based on our historical experience
and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers, we establish reserves for
estimated losses resulting from these accommodations. In the event that we
experience either an unanticipated increase in refunds or cancellations, as we
did in the weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or
our suppliers refuse to accept certain refunds or cancellations or challenge
refunds granted outside of their policies, our costs of revenues could
increase.

•

Allowance for Credit Card Charge-backs.

Because we act as merchant of record in the majority of our
transactions, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on
our website as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally,
we are also held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail
transactions when we do not act as merchant of record. Accordingly, we
calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card
charge-backs.  In the event we experience
an unanticipated increase in fraudulent transactions on our website, our sales
and marketing expense could increase.

•

Equity Investments.

We have a 49% equity
interest in pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, recognize our pro rata
share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net income. 
The carrying value of the investment at December 31, 2004 was $9.4
million.  We periodically test this
investment for impairment using a number of assumptions and estimates.  In the event that future circumstances
indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine
that some part or all of the carrying value of pricelinemortgage.com is impaired
requiring an impairment charge to be recorded.

•

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles.

We evaluate whether events or circumstances
have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and
intangibles may be impaired or not recoverable. The significant factors that
are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in
business strategies, market conditions, or the manner of use of an asset; under
performance relative to historical or expected future operating results; and
negative industry or economic trends.  In
evaluating an asset for possible impairment, management estimates that asset’s
future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable. If
it is determined that the asset is not recoverable, we measure the impairment
based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining
life.  While we believe that our
estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding
such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations.

•

Tax Valuation Allowance.

A valuation allowance was recorded in the amount of $1.3 billion at
both December 31, 2004 and 2003, representing the portion of tax operating
loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that
the benefit of such items will not be realized. 
At December 31, 2004 we had approximately $3 billion of net
operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from December 31,


2019 to December 31, 2021, which are subject to
limitation on future utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986.  In the event that future
operations indicate that some or all of these deferred tax benefits will be
realized, we would recognize a tax provision credit for those estimated future
tax benefits in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The recognition of some or all of such future
tax benefits would involve a significant amount of judgment by management.  In addition, the amount of annual benefit
available under Section 382 is based upon certain conclusions pertaining
to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the Company on the dates
of the ownership changes.  The overall
determination of the annual Section 382 limitation is subject to
interpretation, and therefore, the annual loss limitation could be subject to
change.

•

Merchant Revenues and Merchant Cost of Revenues

Name Your Own Price

®

Services

:  Merchant revenues and related cost of
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and,
among other things, select suppliers determine the
price to be paid by the customer. We recognize such revenue and costs if and
when we accept and fulfill the customer’s non-refundable offer. Merchant
revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and cost,
respectively, of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis.  Pursuant to the terms of our hotel service,
our hotel suppliers are permitted to bill us for the underlying cost of the
service during a specified period of time. 
In the event that we are not billed by our hotel supplier within the
specified time period, we reduce our cost of revenues by the unbilled amounts.  In very limited circumstances, we make
certain customer accommodations to satisfy disputes and complaints. We accrue
for such estimated losses and classify the resulting expense as adjustments to
merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues or the allowance for doubtful
accounts, as appropriate.

Travelweb:

Merchant revenues for Travelweb are derived from transactions where
customers use the Travelweb service to purchase hotel rooms from hotel
suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual arrangements.  Charges are billed to customers at the time
of booking and are included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer
completes his or her stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon
cancellation prior to stay, subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases.
Merchant revenues and accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at
the conclusion of the customer’s stay at the hotel. Travelweb records the
difference between the selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant
revenue.

•

Agency Revenues and Cost of Revenues

priceline.com:

Agency revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we
are not the merchant of record and where the prices of the products sold are
determined by third parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions,
customer processing fees and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are
reported at the net amounts received, without any associated cost of revenue.
Such revenues are recognized when the travel transaction is completed on our
website.

Active Hotels

: 
Active Hotels’ principal source of revenues comes from commission
payments that it receives from hotel suppliers for acting as an agent in the
booking of hotel rooms by customers. 
Active Hotels’ hotel suppliers are billed for their commission payments
owed to Active Hotels and it recognizes agency revenue at the time that its’
customers complete their stay at the hotel.


•

Accounting for State and Local Taxes

.  We
file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles
applicable to traditional businesses. In addition, we pay sales and other taxes
to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold through the priceline.com
service. In certain cases, where appropriate, we remit taxes directly to the
tax authorities.  We believe that this
practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions.  However, one or more states could seek to
impose additional income tax obligations, sales tax collection obligations, or
other tax obligations on companies, such as ours, which engage in or facilitate
online commerce.  A number of proposals
have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the
sale of products and services through the Internet or the income derived from
such sales.  To the extent that any tax
authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to
transactions conducted through the priceline.com service, we might have
additional tax exposure.  We will
continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of additional
tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, we will reserve for those
estimates of liabilities.

•

Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible
Assets

.  We have recorded goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets  related to businesses we have acquired
including Active Hotels, Travelweb and priceline.com europe Ltd. Goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for
impairment using appropriate valuation techniques.  In the event that future circumstances
indicate a need to change these assumptions or estimates, we could determine
that some part or all of the goodwill is impaired requiring an impairment
charge to be recorded.

Financial Presentation

Starting with the three and nine months ended September 30,
2004, we began reporting “online advertising” and “offline advertising” instead
of “advertising expense” on our Unaudited Consolidated Statement of
Operations.  We made this change because
Travelweb and Active Hotels rely primarily on online advertising to drive their
respective businesses, and our acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels have
resulted in a large increase in our consolidated online advertising
spending.  We have added a discussion of
the operating metric “Gross Bookings”, which represents the total dollar value,
inclusive of taxes and fees, of all travel services purchased by our customers.

In addition, starting with the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2004, we began combining (1) warrant costs with sales
and marketing expenses, (2) stock compensation expense with personnel costs and
(3) option taxes with general and administrative expenses, in order to better
display the total cost of the associated activity.

In June 2003, our stockholders approved a
one-for-six reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. The reverse
stock split was effected on June 16, 2003, and,
as a result, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from
approximately 227.6 million to approximately 37.9 million shares. The par value
of the common stock was not affected by the reverse stock split and remains at
$0.008 per share. Consequently, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the
aggregate par value of the issued common stock was reduced by reclassifying the

Results of Operations

Year Ended December 31, 2004 compared to Year
Ended December 31, 2003

Operating Metrics

Our financial results are driven by certain
operating metrics that encompass the selling activity generated by our travel
services.  Specifically, sales of airline
tickets, hotel room nights and rental car days capture the volume of units
purchased by our customers.  Gross
Bookings capture the total dollar value inclusive of taxes and fees of all
travel services purchased by our customers.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room nights and
rental car days sold were as follows:

Airline tickets sold increased by 52.9% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in
2003.  The increase was driven entirely
by the introduction of retail choice to our airline service.  The growth in each period was partially
offset by large annualized percentage decreases in sales of opaque airline
tickets sold in each period.  See “

Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Trends

”
above.

Hotel room nights sold increased by 35.6% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in
2003.  The increase was driven by (1) the
continued success of our opaque hotel service, which benefited from continued
direct advertising support and (2) the inclusion of hotel room nights sold by
Travelweb and Active Hotels during the respective periods in 2004, subsequent
to their acquisitions.

Rental car days sold increased by 37.7% for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003,
due to increases in sales of our opaque rental car service through
priceline.com and our retail rental car service through priceline.com,
Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com.

Gross Bookings increased by 52.2% for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in
2003.  The increase was driven primarily
by a 347.6% increase in agency bookings in 2004 as a result of (1) the
introduction of retail choice to our airline service and (2) the inclusion of
approximately $54 million of bookings from Active Hotels in our 2004
results.  Gross bookings also increased
as a result of an 8.0% increase in merchant bookings in 2004, as a result of
(1) the continued success of our opaque hotel, rental car and vacation package
services which offset significant annualized declines in bookings of our opaque
airline ticket service; and (2) the inclusion of approximately $75 million of
bookings from Travelweb in our 2004 results.

Revenues

We classify our revenue into three categories:


•

Merchant
revenues are derived from transactions where we are the merchant of record and
are responsible for, among other things, collecting receipts from our
customers, remitting payments to our suppliers and establishes
the price of the services we offer. Merchant revenues include (1) the selling
price, as established by us, of the opaque airline tickets, hotel rooms and
rental cars and are reported on a gross basis; and (2) the amount charged to a
customer, less the amount charged by a supplier, in connection with a Travelweb
merchant hotel room.

•

Agency
revenues are derived from travel related transactions where we are not the
merchant of record and where the prices of our services are determined by third
parties. Agency revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees
and Worldspan reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts
received, without any associated cost of revenue.

•

Other
revenues are derived primarily from advertising on our websites.

We continue to experience a shift in our airline
ticket business mix from a historically merchant opaque model to include a
growing number of retail, price disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are
reported gross and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, airline ticket
revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in merchant and retail
sales mix and gross profit has become an important measure of evaluating growth
in our business.  Additionally, our
acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels during the second and third
quarters, respectively, contributed approximately $23.6 million to our revenues
in 2004.

Merchant Revenues

Merchant revenues for twelve months ended December 31,
2004, consisted primarily of:  (1)
transaction revenues representing the selling price of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and vacation packages; (2) transaction
revenues representing the amount charged to a customer, less the amount charged
by suppliers in connection with the sale of hotel rooms on Travelweb; (3)
customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars and (4) ancillary fees, including
Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees related to

Name Your Own Price

®

transactions only.

The $20.5 million increase in merchant revenue for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 compared to the same period in
2003 was primarily attributable to continued growth in

Name Your Own Price

®

hotels and
our vacation package service, and the inclusion of approximately $15.5 million
of revenues from Travelweb in 2004, subsequent to our acquisition of Travelweb,
partially offset by (1) a substantial decrease in the sale of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline
tickets, and (2) decreased travel caused by the adverse weather in the
Southeastern U.S. during the third quarter of 2004.  We believe that the decrease in the number of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our
overall merchant revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2004
–


continued

to be due primarily to low retail airline
ticket prices and the availability of retail tickets on our website.  In particular, we believe that lower retail
pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoffs
associated with our

Name Your Own Price

®

airline service in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates, to purchase
travel services at the lower retail rates, or from “low-cost” carriers without
having to make any trade-offs.

Agency Revenues

Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31,
2004 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier
commissions related primarily to the sale of travel services including the sale
of price-disclosed hotels, rental cars, cruises and other travel services; and
(2) ancillary fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to
price-disclosed transactions.  Agency
revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased from the
same period in 2003, primarily as a result of (1) our increased focus on the
retail airline ticket business, driven primarily by new advertising campaigns
focused on our retail airline ticket and vacation packages service, (2)
increased rental car business, including the impact of our acquisitions of
Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com, and the resulting increase in travel
commissions, GDS and processing fees earned, and (3) the inclusion of
approximately $8 million of agency revenue from Active Hotels subsequent to our
acquisition in September of 2004.

Other Revenues

Other revenues during the twelve months ended December 31,
2004 and 2003 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; and (2) fees
for referring customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services.

Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31,
2004 decreased compared to the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of
lower financial services fees and reduced on-line advertising revenue.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues

During the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, cost of revenues decreased by approximately $1.5 million, over the same
period in 2003, due primarily to a shift in the mix of revenue


generated

by services that produce higher gross
margins.  Specifically, our opaque hotel
service, which produces the highest gross margins of our four principal opaque
offerings, represented a higher percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as
compared to 2003.  Conversely, our opaque
airline service, which produces lower gross margins, declined significantly on
a year-over-year basis, and therefore represented a substantially lower
percentage of total opaque revenues in 2004 as compared to 2003.  Cost of revenues grew at a slower rate than
revenues because opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a
corresponding cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions
in both periods as compared to retail transactions (principally Travelweb) that
are recorded net with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Cost of Merchant Revenues

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost of
opaque hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of hotel occupancy tax, (2) the cost
of opaque airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air
transportation tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in
connection with the sale of airline tickets; (3) the cost of opaque rental cars
from our suppliers, net of applicable taxes; and (4) non-cash acquisition
related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Travelweb.  Cost of merchant revenues for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004, decreased approximately 0.4% compared to
the same period in 2003, due primarily to the shift in the mix of revenue
generated by services that generate different levels of gross margins, as discussed
above.

Cost of Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are recorded at their net amount,
which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any, and
therefore, there are no costs of agency revenues.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, cost of agency revenues consisted exclusively of non-cash acquisition
related amortization expenses associated with the acquisition of Active Hotels.

Cost of Other Revenues

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, there were no costs of other revenues.


Gross Profit

Total gross profit increased for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the same period in 2003, by
approximately $52.2 million primarily as a result of increased revenue from (1)
our opaque hotel and vacation package services; (2) increased sales of retail
services; and (3) the inclusion of results from Travelweb and Active
Hotels.  Total gross margin (gross profit
expressed as a percentage of total revenue) increased during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2004, compared to the same period in 2003, because
opaque transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding
cost of revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in both
periods as compared to retail transactions which are recorded net with no
corresponding cost of revenues.  Because
merchant transactions are reported gross and retail transactions (primarily
Travelweb) are recorded on a net basis, we believe that gross profit has become
an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business.

The following table represents the percentage of gross profit, by
category, in relation to total gross profit:

Merchant Gross Profit

Merchant gross profit consists of merchant revenues less the cost of
merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, merchant
gross profit increased from the same period in 2003, primarily due to (1)
increased revenue from

Name Your Own Price

®

hotels and our vacation package

service

; (2) the
inclusion of $12.3 million of gross profit from Travelweb; and (3)

an increase in
the percentage of our revenues represented by our opaque hotel, vacation
packages and rental car services, which collectively have a higher gross margin
than our opaque airline ticket service.

Merchant gross


margin also increased

because opaque
transactions, whose revenues are recorded gross with a corresponding cost of
revenue, represented a smaller percentage of transactions in 2004, when
compared to retail transactions (primarily Travelweb), which are recorded net
with no corresponding cost of revenues.

Agency Gross Profit

Agency gross profit consists of agency revenues, which is recorded net
of agency costs, if any.  For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004, agency gross profit increased over the
same period in 2003 due to an increase in the sale of disclosed price airline
tickets, rental cars and related processing, GDS fees and travel commissions,
and the inclusion of the results of Active Hotels subsequent to our
acquisition.

Other Gross Profit

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, other gross
profit decreased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a result of lower
pricelinemortgage.com referral fees and reduced on-line advertising revenues.

Operating Expenses

Advertising

Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and
radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, creative talent and production costs
for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, offline advertising expenses increased over the same period in 2003
primarily due to an increase in the frequency of television advertising
associated with our new retail choice airline ticket

service

, continued
advertising for our hotel

service

, creative talent and
production costs for our new advertising campaign.

Online advertising expenses
consist primarily of banners, pop-ups, keyword searches, affiliate programs and
e-mail advertisements.  For the

twelve months
ended December 31, 2004

, online advertising expenses increased over
2003 primarily due to the inclusion of the online advertising expenses of
Travelweb and Active Hotels, which each rely primarily on online advertising to
drive their respective businesses.  We
intend to continue to promote the priceline.com brand aggressively throughout
2005.


Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card
processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate our call centers; (3) provisions for
credit card charge-backs; and (4) warrant costs for the twelve months ended December 31,
2003.  The warrant charge related to the
issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott
International, Inc. during the first quarter 2003.  There was no similar charge during 2004.

For the

twelve months
ended December 31

, 2004, sales and marketing expenses decreased over
the same period in 2003 due to the one-time nature of the charge associated
with the issuance of the warrant in 2003. 
Excluding the effect of the warrant charge of $6.6 million in 2003,
sales and marketing expense for the twelve months

ended December 31

, 2004, were
almost entirely variable in nature and therefore increased over the same period
in 2003, primarily due to increased gross booking volumes as well as the
inclusion of sales and marketing expenses associated with Travelweb and Active
Hotels.

Personnel

Personnel expenses consist of compensation to our personnel, including
salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health benefits and stock based
compensation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, personnel
expenses increased over the same period in 2003 primarily due to additional
salary expense resulting from the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels,
as well as increases in performance-based employee bonuses.


General and Administrative

General and
administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) fees for outside
professionals; (2) business insurance; and (3) occupancy expenses. General and
administrative expenses increased during the twelve months ended December 31,
2004 over the same period in 2003 due to additional fees for outside
professionals, including those related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 compliance and
litigation activities.  General and
administrative expenses also increased as a result of the inclusion of
Travelweb and Active Hotels.

Information
Technology

Information technology expenses consist
primarily of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data
communications and other expenses associated with operating our Internet sites;
and (3) payments to outside contractors. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, information technology expenses increased from the same period in 2003
primarily due to integration and related operating expenses resulting from the
acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of:  (1) amortization of internally developed and
purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of
leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and (4) amortization
of intangible assets with determinable lives primarily associated with the
acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, depreciation and
amortization expense increased from the same period in 2003, primarily as a
result of an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with
the


acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels,
partially offset by a decrease in the depreciable base of certain long-lived
assets.

Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $564,000.  This
restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our
estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in connection
with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $4.7 million.  This
restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel
businesses and a reduction in headcount. 
The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus
resources on our travel business.  The
charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset
impairments.

We estimate, based on current information available,
the remaining net cash outflows associated with our restructuring related
commitments will be paid in 2005.  These
restructuring accruals are recorded in “Accrued expenses” and “Other long-term
liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Interest

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, net interest income
on cash and marketable securities increased over the same period in 2003,
primarily due to higher overall cash and investment balances.  Interest income was partially offset by
interest expense, including coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance
costs incurred in connection with the issuance of our $125 million aggregate
principal amount 1% Convertible Senior Notes issued in August 2003, and
our $100 million aggregate principal amount 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes
issued in June 2004.

Equity in
Income(Loss)  of Investees, net

Equity in loss
of investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004,
represented our pro rata share of the net loss of Travelweb, prior to our
acquisition of a majority of its equity in May and December 2004, and our
pro rata share of pricelinemortgage.com’s net income.  The decrease in equity in


income of investees was
primarily due to (1) increases in interest rates which caused a slowdown in the
refinancing activity by pricelinemortgage.com’s customers that
pricelinemortgage.com benefited from throughout 2003, and (2) the settlement by
pricelinemortgage.com, in the fourth quarter 2004, of a patent infringement
lawsuit and associated legal fees that negatively impact their 2004 operating
results.

Taxes

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an
income tax benefit of $193,000.  The
benefit relates to (1) federal alternative minimum taxes related to income
earned in the United States and (2) a net foreign tax benefit related to the
operations of Active Hotels in the U.K. 
See Note 18 to our Consolidated Unaudited Financial Statements.

Results of
Operations

Year Ended
December 31, 2003 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Revenues

During the year ended December 31, 2003,
we experienced a decrease in total revenue of approximately $140 million
primarily due to a decline in the sale of merchant airline tickets, partially
offset by the improved performance of our hotel and rental car services.
Additionally, we have experienced a shift in our airline ticket business mix
from a primarily merchant opaque model to include a growing number of retail,
price disclosed tickets. Because merchant tickets are reported gross and retail
tickets are recorded on a net basis, revenues could decrease and gross profit
will become an increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our
business.

The number of airline tickets, hotel room
nights and rental car days sold were as follows:

Gross Bookings declined 5.5% for the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, as compared to the same period in 2002 primarily as a result of a decline
in the sale of merchant airline tickets, partially offset by the improved
performance of our hotel and rental car services.

Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
consisted primarily of: (1) merchant revenues; (2) agency revenues; and (3)
other revenues.


Merchant Revenues

Merchant revenues are derived from transactions where we are the
merchant of record and determine the price to be paid by the customer.  Merchant revenues for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of:  (1) transaction revenues representing the
selling price of

Name Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars; (2) customer processing fees
charged in connection with the sale of

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline tickets, hotel rooms and rental
cars and (3) ancillary fees, including Worldspan, L.P. reservation booking fees
for merchant transactions only.

The approximately $144 million decrease in merchant revenue for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same period in 2002
was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of

Name
Your Own Price

®

tickets sold, which was
partially offset by the improved performance of our

Name
Your Own Price

®

hotel and rental car

service

s.

We believe that the decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets
sold – and the corresponding effect that decrease had on our overall merchant
revenues during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 – continued to
be due primarily to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced
airline inventory available to us.  In particular,
we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be
willing to make the tradeoffs associated with our

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline

service

in exchange
for savings off of higher retail rates to purchase travel

service

s at the lower
retail rates or from “low-cost” carriers without having to make any
trade-offs.  In addition, many airlines
grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, and upon the outbreak of war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS, thus
decreasing capacity on existing flights, which we believe reduced airline
inventory available to us.

In addition, in
the past, we have “subsidized” certain

Name
Your Own Price

®

offers to purchase merchant airline
tickets by adding a variable amount to some customers’ offers to increase the
likelihood that such customers’ offers would be successful.  These “subsidies” had the effect of, among
other things, increasing the number of merchant airline tickets sold and our
merchant revenues but at the expense of lower gross margins.  At the end of 2002, we made the strategic
decision to reduce sales of subsidized airline tickets.  To this end, we reduced subsidies we have
historically applied to certain merchant airline ticket offers.  While this has had the effect of reducing the
number of merchant airline tickets sold and our revenue during 2003, it has
positively contributed to our gross profit and gross margin.

The year-over-year decrease in the number of merchant airline tickets sold,
and the corresponding effect it had on our merchant revenue, was partially
offset by the increase in hotel room nights and rental car days sold in the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003. 
We believe that the increase in hotel room night sold during the twelve
months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same periods in 2002

was principally
driven by our emphasis on our hotel business, and specifically by the success
of our advertising campaign focused on our hotel service,

and the
competitive room inventory and pricing we receive from our hotel partners.  We believe the increase in rental car days
sold during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same
periods in 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our rental
car

service

, which we believe was driven by, among other
things, an increase in visits to our website as a result of our advertising,
and an overall increase in demand for leisure rental cars generally,
improvements we made to the presentation of our rental car

service

on our website
and improvement in the inventory and pricing we receive from our rental car
partners.

Agency Revenues

Agency revenues are derived from travel
related transactions where we are not the merchant of record and where the prices
of products are determined by third parties. 
Agency revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 consisted primarily of: (1) processing fees and third-party supplier
commissions related to the sale of travel services including the sale of price
disclosed airline tickets, cruises and other travel services; and (2) ancillary
fees, including GDS reservation booking fees related to price-disclosed
transactions.  Agency revenues for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003


increased approximately 949% from the same period a year ago, primarily
as a result of our increased focus on the retail airline ticket and rental car
business and the resulting increase in travel commissions and processing fees
earned.

Other Revenues

Other revenues during twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 consisted primarily of: (1) advertising revenues; (2) fees for referring
customers to pricelinemortgage.com for home financing services and to AIG for
travel insurance and in 2002 automobile services; (3) in 2002, transaction
revenue from our long distance phone service, which we repositioned in 2002;
and (4) in 2002, license fees from Hutchison-Priceline Limited.

Other revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003
decreased approximately 46% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002,
primarily as a result of the decrease in fees earned from our home financing
service, and due to our repositioning of our long distance phone service.

Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit

Cost of Revenues

Cost of Merchant Revenues

.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, cost of merchant revenues consisted primarily of: (1) the cost
of airline tickets from our suppliers, net of the federal air transportation
tax, segment fees and passenger facility charges imposed in connection with the
sale of airline tickets; (2) the cost of hotel rooms from our suppliers, net of
hotel occupancy tax; and (3) the cost of rental cars from our suppliers, net of
applicable taxes.  Cost of merchant revenues
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, decreased approximately
15%, primarily due to a decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, as
discussed above.

Cost of Agency Revenues

.  Agency revenues are recorded at their net
amount, which are amounts received less amounts paid to suppliers, if any.


Cost of Other Revenues

.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2002, cost of other revenues consisted of the cost of long distance telephone
service provided by our suppliers.  For the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003, there were no such costs due to the
repositioning of our long distance telephone service in the fourth quarter of
2002.

Gross Profit

.

Total gross profit decreased
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the twelve
months ended December 31, 2002, by $12.4 million primarily as a result of
the decrease in sales of merchant airline tickets, described above.  Partially offsetting the reduction in total
gross profit was growth in merchant hotel and rental car gross profit as well
as an increase in agency gross profit. 
Total gross profit, expressed as a percentage of total revenue,
increased during the period ended December 31, 2003 compared to the same
period during 2002 as a result of an ongoing shift in our business mix from
primarily merchant opaque transactions, reported on a gross basis, to include
more retail agency transactions, recorded on a net basis.  Because merchant tickets are reported gross
and retail tickets are recorded on a net basis, gross profit will become an
increasing important measure of evaluating growth in our business.

The following table represents the percentage of gross profit, by
category, in relation to total gross profit:

Merchant Gross Profit

.  Merchant gross profit consists of merchant
revenues less the cost of merchant revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, merchant gross profit decreased from the same period in 2002, primarily
due to the continued weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced
airline inventory available to us, factors which are described in “Merchant
Revenues,” above, in more detail.  As
discussed in “Merchant Revenues” above, at the end of 2002, we strategically
reduced subsidies applied to certain

Name
Your Own Price

®

airline ticket sales.  While this resulted in a reduction


in merchant revenues, the subsidy reduction
positively affected our gross profit and increased our gross margin.  We are able to manage the level of gross
margins by controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled.  Our merchant gross margin in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2003 increased over the same periods a year ago
primarily as the result of a shift in mix of our

service

s from the sale
of airline tickets to the sale of hotel room nights and rental car days.

Agency Gross Profit

.  Agency gross profit consists of agency
revenues, which is recorded net of agency costs, if any.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, agency gross profit increased over the same period in 2002 due to an
increase in the sale of disclosed price airline tickets, rental cars and
related fees and commissions.

Other Gross Profit

.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, other gross profit decreased over the same period in 2002 as a result of
decreases in fees earned in connection with our long distance phone service and
home financing services and decrease in license fees from Hutchison-Priceline
Limited.

Operating Expenses

Advertising

Offline advertising expenses consist primarily of: (1) television and
radio advertising; and (2) agency fees, creative talent and production costs
for television and radio commercials. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, offline advertising expenses decreased over the same period in 2002
primarily due to a shift from primarily radio advertising to lower absolute dollars
spent on television advertising and partially offset by an increase in
production and creative talent fees. 
Online advertising expenses consist primarily of banners, pop-ups,
keyword searches, affiliate programs and e-mail advertisements.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, online advertising expenses decreased over the same period in 2002,
primarily due to a reduction in our use of certain online advertising channels.

Sales and Marketing


Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of (1) credit card
processing fees associated with merchant transactions; (2) fees paid to
third-party service providers that operate our call centers; (3) provisions for
credit card charge-backs; and (4) warrant costs for the twelve months ended December 31,
2003.  The warrant charge related to the
issuance of warrants to purchase priceline.com common stock to Marriott
International, Inc. during the first quarter 2003.  There was no similar charge during 2002.

For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, sales and marketing expenses, increased over the same periods in 2002 due
primarily to the issuance of warrants to Marriott, partially offset by a
decrease in variable sales and marketing expenses.

Personnel

Personnel expenses consist primarily of compensation to our personnel,
including salaries, bonuses, taxes, employee health benefits and stock based
compensation.  For the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003, personnel expenses decreased over the same
periods in 2002 due to the full-year effect of a reduction in headcount
undertaken during our fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, partially offset by an
increase in employee bonus expense.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: (1) business
insurance; (2) fees for outside professionals; (3) occupancy expenses; and (4)
telecommunications costs. General and administrative expenses decreased during
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared with the same periods
in 2002 as a result of decreases in employment agency fees, taxes and stock
based compensation, partially offset by higher professional fees and premiums
on our Directors and Officers liability insurance policies.  General and administrative expenses were also
impacted by the favorable resolution of certain obligations, without which the
year-over-year reduction would have been approximately 5%.


Information
Technology

Information technology expenses consist primarily
of: (1) system maintenance and software license fees; (2) data communications
and other expenses associated with operating our Internet site; and (3)
payments to outside contractors.

For
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, information technology expenses
decreased over the same period in 2002 primarily as a result of cost
efficiencies generated by cost savings initiatives, additional capitalized
development costs associated with the launch of our retail services.  In addition, Information Technology expenses
were reduced by the favorable settlement of certain vendor disputes related to
data communications and telecom expenses without which the year-over-year
reduction would have been approximately 23%.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of:  (1) amortization of internally developed and
purchased software, (2) depreciation of computer equipment, (3) depreciation of
our leasehold improvements, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, and
(4) amortization of our intangible assets with determinable lives.  For the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, depreciation and amortization expense decreased over the same periods in
2002, primarily as a result of a smaller depreciable asset base and a reduction
in capital expenditures in 2003.

Restructuring, Severance, and Special Charges

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $564,000.  This
restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation and refinement of our
estimated real estate costs related to leased property vacated in connection
with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $4.7 million.  This
restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non-travel
businesses and a reduction in headcount. 
The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus
resources on our travel business.  The
charge relates primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset
impairments.

As a result of the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring, our work force
was reduced by 59 full-time employees at our Norwalk location and 4 full-time
employees at our Europe location.  The
employee


termination costs primarily represent
severance payments and related benefits. 
The real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease
expense related to space we decided we no longer needed, and which we will not
utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that
space.  Asset impairments are comprised
of abandoned equipment and software projects, and software costs related to our
plans not to pursue certain

service

offerings and
activities.  Other restructuring charges
include professional and other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with
the restructuring activities.

During 2003 and 2002, we decreased the
liability for the restructuring charge by approximately $753,000 and
approximately $916,000, respectively. 
These reductions resulted from the favorable resolution of certain
matters, primarily the collection of certain receivables and the settlement of
real estate commitments, and were reflected as an adjustment to the “Restructuring
charge (reversal)” line on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Restructuring accruals are recorded in “Accrued
expenses” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Impairment Charge

During the third quarter of 2002, we
performed impairment tests and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill
of $22.5 million related to our European operations exceeded its implied fair
value by approximately $12 million and accordingly recorded an impairment
charge of $12 million. The fair value was determined using generally accepted
valuation techniques including the market value of comparable companies
(including revenue multiple methodology) and discounted cash flow. Underlying
the impairment was a continued decline in the market value of priceline.com’s
common stock, which we review quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment
of priceline.com europe Ltd.’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com
europe Ltd.’s operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive
conditions among European online travel companies and a decision in the third
quarter of 2002 to reconfigure service offerings.

During the third quarter of 2002 we performed
a periodic evaluation of the progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline
Limited. Factors including increasing negative variances in key operating
metrics such as negative gross margins and continuing operating losses,
negative net asset position and an increasingly competitive operating
environment led us to determine that the carrying value of our convertible note
no longer reflected its fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment
charge of approximately $12.2 million. 
Estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates and a
review of the market value of comparable companies including the consideration
of the decline in our market value and through discussion with third party
valuation specialists.

Interest

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, interest income on
cash and marketable securities decreased over the same period in 2002 due to
lower interest rates.  Interest income
was also partially offset by interest expense, including amortization of debt
issuance costs incurred in connection


with the
issuance of our $125 million aggregate principal amount 1% Convertible Senior
Notes.  Interest on the notes is payable
on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

Equity in Income of
Investees, net

Equity in income of
investees, net for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 of $2.3
million, represented our pro rata share of the net income of
pricelinemortgage.com and, in 2003, our pro rata share of the net loss of
Travelweb.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2004, we had $247.7 million in cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Approximately $23.6
million is restricted cash on deposit collateralizing letters of credit issued
in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. Also included in restricted cash
are amounts held by our credit card processor company. We generally invest
excess cash to make such funds readily available for operating purposes.  Cash equivalents and short-term investments
are primarily comprised of highly liquid, high quality, investment grade debt
instruments.

All of our merchant transactions are structured such that we collect
cash up front from our customers and then we pay most of our suppliers over a
ten to fifteen day period.  We therefore
tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the
absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every
quarter.  This can cause volatility in
working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating
income would indicate.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2004 was $42.0 million, resulting from net income of $31.5 million, non-cash
items not affecting December 31, 2004 cash flows of $17.7 million,
partially offset by $7.2 million of changes in working capital.  The changes in working capital for the year
ended December 31, 2004, were primarily related to a $2.2 million increase
in accounts receivable and a $4.4 million decrease in accounts payable and
accrued expenses.  The increase in
accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues attributable
to increased hotel, vacation package and rental car transactions.  The decrease in accounts payable and accrued
expenses was primarily due to seasonal decreases in deferred merchant bookings
and accounts payable balances.  Non-cash
items were primarily associated with the depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment and intangible assets, primarily those acquired in our
acquisitions of Travelweb and Active Hotels. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31,
2003, was $20.0 million, resulting from net income of $11.9 and $10.5 million
of changes in working capital offset by non-cash items not affecting December 31
cash flows of approximately $18.6 million. 
The changes in working capital were primarily related to an
approximately $13.8 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued
expenses.  The decrease in accounts
payable was related to our year-end supplier payables only being outstanding
for 10 calendar days, as compared to 15 calendar days in 2002.  The decrease was also attributable to cash
payments related to our restructuring during the year, and a general decrease
in expenses which resulted in lower trade accounts payable and accrued expense
balances.  Non-cash items were primarily
a warrant charge related to the Marriott transaction discussed earlier, and the
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment.


Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $143.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2004, and approximately $112.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003. 
During the year ended December 31, 2004, we invested $164.7
million, net of cash acquired, in acquisitions, the substantial majority of
which related to Active Hotels.  During
the year ended December 31, 2003, Lowestfare.com, our wholly-owned
subsidiary, invested approximately $14.2 million in our initial equity
investment in Travelweb and other acquisitions

.

Investing activities in the
year ended December 31, 2004 was affected by the maturities of short-term
investments and marketable securities in the amount of $28.2 million.  In both years, net cash used in investing
activities was also affected by purchases of property and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately $107.2 million and

$118.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively.  The cash provided by
financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004, was
primarily the $100 million proceeds from our issuance of 2.25% Convertible
Senior Notes and, for the year ended December 31, 2003, the $125 million
proceeds from the issuance of 1% Convertible Senior Notes.  Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock
options provided cash of $6.8 million and $10.3 million during the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

The following table represents the Company’s material contractual
obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004:

(1)

Assumes redemption of 1%
Senior Convertible Notes during August 2008 and 2.25% Senior Convertible
Notes during January 2010.  Assumes
no conversion of the Notes into common stock.

(2)

Assumes no additional
exercise of warrants and redemption of Redeemable Preferred stock during February 2007.

See Note 19 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Priceline.com leases certain property, primarily space in buildings in
Norwalk, Connecticut; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas (Travelweb); Cambridge and
London, England (Active Hotels); and Staines, England (priceline.com europe).  These leases are accounted for as operating
leases.  The operating lease obligations
represent the minimum payments for our operating leases. See Note 19 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2003, we issued, in a private placement, $125 million
aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010,
with an interest rate of 1% (the “1% Notes”). 
The 1% Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into our
common stock, par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the holder, at a
conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events.  Each
$1,000 principal amount of 1% Notes will initially be convertible into 25
shares of our common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing
price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period, as defined in the
offering memorandum related to the 1% Notes, is more than 110% of the then current
conversion price of the 1% Notes, or after August 1, 2008, if the closing
price of our common stock is more than 110% of the then current conversion
price of the 1% Notes.  The 1% Notes


are also convertible in certain other
circumstances set forth in the offering memorandum, such as a change in control
of priceline.com.  In addition, the 1%
Notes will be redeemable at our option beginning in 2008, and the holders may
require us to repurchase the 1% Notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain
other circumstances.  Interest on the 1%
Notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

In November 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement
whereby we swapped the fixed 1% interest on the 1% Notes for a floating
interest rate based on the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable
margin of approximately 221 basis points, on $45 million notional value of
debt.  This agreement expires August 1,
2010.  We designated this interest rate
swap agreement as a fair value hedge. 
The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and
the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting gains and losses in interest
income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

In June 2004, we issued, in a private
placement, $100 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes
due January 15, 2025, with an interest rate of 2.25% (the “2.25% Notes”).  The 2.25% Notes are convertible, subject to
certain conditions, into our common stock at the option of the holder, at a
conversion price of approximately $37.95 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events.  Each
$1,000 principal amount of 2.25% Notes will initially be convertible into
26.3505 shares of our common stock if, on or prior to January 15, 2025,
certain conditions occur.  The 2.25%
Notes are also convertible in certain other circumstances set forth in the
offering memorandum, such as a change in control of priceline.com.  In the event that all or substantially all of
our common stock is acquired prior to January 15, 2010, in a transaction
in which the consideration paid to holders of our common stock consists of all
or substantially all cash, we would be required to make additional payments to
the holders of amounts ranging from $0 to $19.1 million depending upon the date
of the transaction and our then current stock price.  In addition, the 2.25% Notes will be
redeemable at our option beginning January 20, 2010, and the holders may
require us to repurchase the 2.25% Notes on January 15, 2010, 2015 and
2020 or in certain other circumstances. 
Interest on the 2.25% Notes is payable January 15 and July 15
of each year.

During 2004, we used a portion of the net proceeds
from the issuance of the 1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of
Travelweb and Active Hotels.  The
remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, strategic uses
and working capital requirements.

Excluded from the table above are letters of credit aggregating
approximately $10.7 million that were issued in favor of certain suppliers and
landlords. The letters of credit expire between March 2005 and March 2006
and are generally subject to automatic renewal upon expiration of the letter of
credit.  Also excluded are employment
agreements with certain members of senior management that provide for minimum
annual compensation, upon termination of employment, of approximately $4.5
million.

Our Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per
share plus an amount equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not
paid, and is subject to mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007.  In the event that we consummate certain
business combination transactions, our Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed
at our option or at the option of the holder at the liquidation preference per
outstanding share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and dividends that would
have accrued through February 6, 2007. 
There were 13,470 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at December 31,
2004.  See Note 15 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information regarding the rights and preferences
of our Series B Preferred Stock.

We believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be
sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other
obligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if during that
period or thereafter, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash
flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in
sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce
our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope of our business
strategies, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future
financial


condition or results of operations. If
additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the
percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be diluted.  There are no assurances that we will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, that revenue growth will
continue or that future borrowings or equity contributions will be available in
amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, repay and debt or
preferred stock or finance our business strategies.

Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a full
description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective
expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial
condition.

Item 7A.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk
through internally established policies and procedures and, when deemed
appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
derivative financial instruments, including an interest rate hedge to manage
market risks.

The objective of our policies is to mitigate
potential income statement, cash flow and fair value exposures resulting from
possible future adverse fluctuations in interest rates. We evaluate our
exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near-term and long-term
fluctuations in interest rates on a daily basis. This evaluation includes the
review of leading market indicators, discussions with financial analysts and
investment bankers regarding current and future economic conditions and the
review of market projections as to expected future interest rates. We utilize this
information to determine our own investment strategies as well as to determine
if the use of derivative financial instruments is appropriate to mitigate any
potential future interest rate exposure that we may face. Our policy does not
allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of
derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We
do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to
any leveraged derivatives.

We did not experience any material changes in
interest rate exposures during the year ended December 31, 2004. 
Based upon economic conditions and leading market indicators at December 31,
2004, we do not foresee a significant adverse change in interest rates in the
near future.

As of December 31, 2004, after adjusting
for the effect of the interest rate swap agreement, we have fixed rate debt of
approximately $224.4 million.  We
estimate that the fair market value of our debt was approximately $215.9 million
as of December 31, 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, we held an
interest rate swap agreement on $45 million notional value of our fixed rate
debt.  The fair value (cost if terminated) of this swap as of December 31,
2004 was approximately $692,000.  A 10%
adverse fluctuation in the 3-month LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2004,
would decrease the interest rate swap’s fair value by approximately
$537,000.  Any increase or decrease in
the fair value of the Company’s interest rate sensitive derivative instruments
would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the
fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability, or cash flow.

International net revenues result from
transactions by Active Hotels and are typically denominated in British Pounds,
the functional currency of Active Hotels. 
Active Hotels also incurs most of its expenses in British Pounds. Our
international operations are subject to risks typical of international
business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes
in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and
restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.


Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial
position as well as our results of operations. Foreign exchange rate
fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and
liabilities of Active Hotels are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, foreign exchange rate
fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations as exchange rate
fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar result in gains and losses that are reflected in our Consolidated Statement
of Operations.  In January 2005, we
entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term
foreign currency fluctuations on the operating results of Active Hotels. The
gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the currency
translation gains and losses recognized in other accumulated comprehensive
income.  No forward contracts or other
economic hedges were entered into during the year ended December 31, 2004,
however, we may enter into such forward contracts or other economic hedges in
the future.

We convert the financial statements of Active
Hotels into U.S. dollars. When there is a change in foreign currency
exchange rates, the conversion of Active Hotels’ financial statements into
U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss. Translation exposure
is the change in the book value of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses
that results from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time
we may enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency
denominated earnings translation exposure using both foreign currency options
and forward contracts.

Additionally, fixed rate investments are
subject to interest rate volatility.  To
the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect
general economic conditions, priceline.com would also be affected by such
changes.

Item 9.  Changes in and
Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer,
we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation,
our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in


Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Based on our evaluation

,

our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004. 
We excluded from our assessment the internal control over financial
reporting at Active Hotels, which was acquired on September 21, 2004 and
whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting
approximately 4% and 1%, respectively, of the related Consolidated Financial
Statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Controls.

No change in our internal control over financial reporting
(as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the
fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 that materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

We are in the process of integrating the operations of
Travelweb, control of which we acquired in May 2004.   The integration will involve changes in
certain systems, processes and internal controls. As we further integrate
Travelweb’s business, we will continue to review internal controls to ensure
that they continue to be effective.

In September 2004, we acquired Active Hotels, and as a
result of that acquisition, we have undertaken a review of Active Hotel’s
internal controls and intend to make changes, if necessary, that we believe to
be appropriate to those internal controls as we integrate Active Hotel’s
business with ours. As we further integrate Active Hotel’s business, we will
continue to review Active Hotel’s internal controls and may take further steps
to ensure that its internal controls are effective and integrated
appropriately.

Item 9B. Other Information

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

priceline.com,
Incorporated

Norwalk,

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of priceline.com, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. We also have audited
management’s assessment, included in

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

set forth in
Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

, management excluded from their assessment the
internal control over financial reporting at Active Hotels, Ltd. which was
acquired on September 21, 2004 and whose financial statements reflect
total assets and revenues constituting approximately 4% and 1%, respectively, of
the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2004. Accordingly, our audit did not include the
internal control over financial reporting at Active Hotels, Ltd. The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, an
opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit of financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management,
and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error


or
fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of
any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our
opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

- The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, priceline.com
Europe Holdings N. V. (“priceline.com Europe Holdings”) and Travelweb LLC (“Travelweb”),
and its 96.6%-owned subsidiary, Active Hotels Ltd (“Active Hotels”). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in affiliates in which the Company does not have
control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted
for by the equity method.

In 2003, the Company’s stockholders approved a
one-for-six reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. The reverse
stock split was effected on June 16, 2003, and, as a result, the Company’s
issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from approximately 227.6
million to approximately 37.9 million shares. The par value of the common stock
was not affected by the reverse stock split and remains at $0.008 per share. Consequently,
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, the aggregate par value of the
issued common stock was reduced by reclassifying the par value amount of the
eliminated shares of common stock to Additional Paid-in Capital. All per share
amounts and outstanding shares, including all common stock equivalents (stock
options), have been retroactively restated in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for all
periods presented to reflect the reverse stock split.

Use of Estimates

– The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

- The
Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, accounts receivable-net, accounts payable, accrued expenses
and deferred merchant bookings, are carried at cost which approximates their
fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. As
of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the Company’s outstanding 1.0%
Convertible Senior Notes was $116.6 million and the fair value of the Company’s
outstanding 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes was $99.3 million. The Company uses
derivative financial instruments, including interest rate hedges to manage
market risks. The Company entered into an interest rate hedge agreement in
relation to $45 million of the outstanding borrowings of the 1.0% Convertible
Senior Notes with a term of approximately 5 years. See Note 12, “Convertible
Debt.”

Cash and Cash Equivalents

- The Company invests excess cash primarily
in money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and short-term commercial
paper. All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months
or less are considered cash equivalents.


Short-Term Investments

– At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company had short-term investments of $122.8 million and $151.7 million,
respectively. The short-term investments primarily consist of commercial paper,
corporate notes, and U.S. Government Agency Securities. In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” the Company has classified
these short-term investments as available-for-sale. These securities are
carried at estimated fair market value with the aggregate unrealized gains and
losses related to these investments, net of taxes, reflected as a part of
accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity.

The fair value of the investments is based on the
specific quoted market price of the securities at the Consolidated Balance
Sheet dates. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair
value is judged to be other than temporary. Once a decline in fair value is
determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a
new cost basis in the investment is established. The marketable securities are
presented as current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as
they are available to meet the short-term working capital needs of the Company.

Restricted Cash

- Restricted cash collateralizes letters of
credit issued in favor of certain suppliers and landlords. The letters of
credit expire between March 2005 and March 2006 and are generally
subject to automatic renewal upon expiration. Also included in restricted cash
are amounts held by our credit card processing company and the counterparty to
the interest rate hedge agreement in connection with the Company’s 1%
Convertible Senior Notes.

Property and Equipment

- Property and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis, over the estimated
useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of the lease,
whichever is shorter.

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

– We account
for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires
that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of
acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price,
including related transaction costs, over the estimated fair values of the net
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Our Consolidated Financial Statements
and results of operations reflect an acquired business starting at the date of
the acquisition.

Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reviewed
at least annually for impairment, or earlier if there is indication of
impairment, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” SFAS 142 also requires the Company to compare
the fair value of the acquired business to its carrying amount on an annual
basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value
of the acquired business is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its
carrying value. SFAS 142 requires the Company to compare the fair value of
an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying
amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment
loss is recognized. Fair values for goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows, market
multiples or appraised values.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and Intangible Assets

-
The Company reviews long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered to be impaired when
the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposition exceeds its carrying amount. The
amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the carrying
value of the asset over the present value of estimated future cash flows using
a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.


Software Capitalization

- Certain direct development costs associated
with internal-use software are capitalized and include external direct costs of
services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to the software projects
principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing of the software. These costs are recorded as fixed
assets and are amortized over a period not to exceed three years beginning when
the asset is substantially ready for use. Costs incurred during the preliminary
project stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as
incurred.

Merchant Revenues and Cost of
Merchant Revenues

Name Your
Own Price

®

Services

: Merchant revenues and
related cost of revenues are derived from transactions where priceline.com is
the merchant of record and, among other things, selects suppliers and
determines the price to be paid by the customer. The Company recognizes such
revenues and costs if and when it fulfills the customer’s non-refundable offer.
Merchant revenues and cost of merchant revenues include the selling price and
cost, respectively, of the travel services and are reported on a gross basis. Pursuant
to the terms of the Company’s hotel service, its hotel suppliers are permitted
to bill the Company for the underlying cost of the service during a specified
period of time. In the event that the Company is not billed by its hotel
supplier within the specified time period, the Company reduces its cost of
revenues by the unbilled amounts. In very limited circumstances, priceline.com
makes certain customer accommodations to satisfy disputes and complaints. The
Company accrues for such estimated losses and classifies the resulting expense
as adjustments to merchant revenue and cost of merchant revenues or the
allowance for doubtful accounts, as appropriate.

Travelweb

: Merchant revenues for Travelweb are derived
from transactions where its customers use the Travelweb service to purchase
hotel rooms from hotel suppliers at rates which are subject to contractual
arrangements. Charges are billed to customers at the time of booking and are
included in Deferred Merchant Bookings until the customer completes his or her
stay. Such amounts are generally refundable upon cancellation prior to stay,
subject to cancellation penalties in certain cases. Merchant revenues and
accounts payable to the hotel supplier are recognized at the conclusion of the
customer’s stay at the hotel. Travelweb records the difference between the
selling price and the cost of the hotel room as merchant revenue.

Agency Revenues and Cost of Agency
Revenues

priceline.com

: Agency revenues are derived from travel
related transactions where the Company is not the merchant of record and where
the prices of the products sold are determined by third parties. Agency
revenues include travel commissions, customer processing fees and Worldspan
reservation booking fees and are reported at the net amounts received, without
any associated cost of revenue. Such revenues are recognized by the Company
when the travel transaction is completed on the Company’s website.

Active
Hotels

: Active Hotels’
principal source of revenues comes from commission payments that it receives
from hotel suppliers for acting as an agent in the booking of hotel rooms by
its customers. Active Hotels’ hotel suppliers are billed for their commission
payments owed to Active Hotels and it recognizes agency revenue at the time
that its customers complete their stay at the hotel.

Advertising

-

Offline

-
Advertising-offline expenses are comprised primarily of costs of television,
radio and newspaper advertising, agency fees, creative talent and production
cost for television and radio commercials.  The Company expenses the
production costs of advertising the first time the advertising takes place.


Advertising

-

Online

– Advertising-online expenses consist primarily of banners, pop-ups, keyword
searches, affiliate programs and email advertisements and are recognized as the
advertisements take place.

Sales and Marketing

- Sales and marketing expenses are comprised
primarily of credit card processing fees, fees paid to third-party service
providers that operate the Company’s call centers, provisions for credit card
charge-backs and provisions for uncollectible commissions, all of which are
expensed as incurred.

Personnel –

Personnel expenses consist of compensation to
our personnel, including salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes, employee health
insurance and stock based compensation.  Included
in accrued expenses were accrued compensation expenses of $5.8 million and $4.1
million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Information Technology

– Information technology expenses are
comprised primarily of system maintenance and software license fees, data
communications and other expenses associated with operating the Company’s
Internet sites and payments to outside contractors. Such costs are expensed as
incurred.

Equity-Based Compensation

- The Company accounts for stock-based
employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure.” As allowed by SFAS
123, the Company accounts for stock options issued to employees under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and complies with the disclosure provisions of
SFAS No. 123. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is based on the
difference, if any, on the date of grant of the stock option, between the fair
value of priceline.com’s stock and the exercise price of the stock option.

The Company accounts for equity instruments issued
to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging
Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 96-18, “Accounting for Equity Instruments
That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services.” All transactions, in which goods or services are
the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments, are
accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair
value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
The measurement date of the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the
earlier of the date on which the counterparty’s performance is complete or the
date on which it is probable that performance will occur.

The following table summarizes relevant information
as to reported results under the Company’s APB Opinion No. 25 method of
accounting for stock options with supplemental information as if the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been applied (in thousands, except
per share amounts):


The fair value of stock options granted was
determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

Income Taxes

- The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or
tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the temporary difference between the financial statement
and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates in effect.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be realized.

Segment Reporting

- The Company operates and manages its
business as a single operating segment. For geographic related information, see
Note 21 to these Consolidated Financial Statements.


Foreign Currency Translation

– The functional currency of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange existing at year end. Income
statement amounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation
gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and
losses are included in the statement of operations and were immaterial for all
periods presented. From time to time, the Company may enter into forward
contracts with counter parties pursuant to which future foreign exchange rates
for expected future earnings are fixed. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses resulting from the forward contracts are recognized in the period in
which they occur. As of December 31, 2004, there were no such forward
contracts outstanding.

Derivative Financial Instruments

- The Company is exposed to market risks
arising from changes in interest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments
principally in the management of interest rate exposure. On the date on which
the Company enters into a derivative transaction, the derivative is designated
as a hedge of the identified exposure. The Company formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
In this documentation, the Company specifically identifies the asset,
liability, firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment that has
been designated as the hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is
expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item. The Company measures
effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an
ongoing basis. The Company’s derivative instruments do not contain leverage
features.

Reclassifications

– Certain prior year balances have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

–

In
September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued statement
EITF Issue No. 04-08, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on
Diluted Earnings per Share” (“EITF 04-08”). Contingently convertible debt
instruments are generally convertible into common shares of an issuer after the
common stock price has exceeded a predetermined threshold for a specified
period of time (the “market price contingency”). EITF 04-08 requires that
shares issuable upon conversion of contingently convertible debt, such as the
Company’s 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025 (the “2.25%
Notes”) and its1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010 (the “1%
Notes” and, together with the 2.25% Notes, the “Notes”), be included in diluted
earnings per share computations regardless of whether the market price
contingency contained in the debt instrument has been met. The Company has
historically excluded the potential dilutive effect of the conversion feature
from diluted earnings per share. EITF 04-08 became effective for reporting
periods ending after December 15, 2004 and required restatement of prior
periods to the extent applicable. The 1% Notes were dilutive to earnings per
share for the full year 2004, but not for 2003. The 2.25% Notes were not
dilutive to earnings per share since their issuance. The adoption of EITF 04-08
required the Company to include approximately 3,125,000 and 2,635,046
additional shares, respectively, of common stock underlying the 1% Notes and
2.25% Notes in its diluted earnings per share calculation in the event that
their inclusion is dilutive to earnings per share. The impact of the additional
shares in the calculation of diluted earnings per share is offset by exclusion
of coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the
Notes. The adoption of EITF 04-08 could result in a material reduction in our
diluted earnings per share in future periods.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB
Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123 (R)”), “Share-Based Payment”, which
is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”
SFAS 123(R) eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and requires that
such transactions be accounted for using a fair value-based method. SFAS 123
(R) covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including
stock options and restricted share plans. The Company will be required to apply
SFAS 123 (R) as of July 1, 2005.


The Company expects to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the “modified
prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date based on (a) the requirements of SFAS 123 (R) for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) the requirements
of Statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective
date of SFAS 123 (R) that remain unvested on the effective date. Upon adoption
of SFAS 123(R), the impact of unvested stock options granted as of December 31,
2004 is estimated to increase personnel expense by $3.9 million in 2005, $6.6
million in 2006 and $1.8 million in 2007.

In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue
No. 02-14, “Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of
Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock.” EITF Issue No. 02-14
addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does
not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises
significant influence through other means. EITF Issue No. 02-14 states that
an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has
investments in either common stock or in-substance common stock of a
corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The
accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 02-14 are effective for the first
quarter of fiscal 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF Issue
No. 02-14 to have a significant impact on its financial statements.

In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue
No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments” which provides new guidance for assessing
impairment losses on debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF Issue
No.  03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are
deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the
accounting provisions of EITF Issue No.  03-1; however, the disclosure
requirements remain effective and have been adopted. The Company will evaluate
the effect, if any, of EITF Issue No. 03-1 when final guidance is
released.

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Active Hotels Ltd.

– On September 21, 2004, Priceline.com
Holdco U.K. Limited, a newly formed English wholly-owned subsidiary of
priceline.com, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement with shareholders and
option holders of Active Hotels, one of Europe’s leading online reservation
providers to the hotel industry. The total purchase price, including
transaction related costs, for all of the Active Hotels shares was
approximately $165.4 million, which was determined through arms-length
negotiation and paid in cash.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
results of operations include the financial statements of Active Hotels since
the acquisition in September 2004. Under the purchase method of
accounting, the proportion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
Active Hotels are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective
estimated fair values. The acquisition cost, including transaction costs, was
allocated to the underlying net assets of Active Hotels in proportion to their
respective estimated fair values. The Company obtained an independent valuation
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the identification of
intangible assets other than goodwill to assist the Company in its purchase
price allocation. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
values of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.

Assets acquired consisted principally of cash and
intangible assets. Liabilities assumed consisted principally of accounts
payable, accrued expenses and deferred taxes. Goodwill resulting from this
transaction amounted to approximately $96 million based upon the currency
exchange rate as of the acquisition date.

A list of the estimated fair value and useful lives
of the most significant acquired identifiable intangible assets based upon the
currency exchange rate as of the acquisition date is as follows:


In connection with the Company’s acquisition of
Active Hotels, the Company sold a 2.3% equity interest in Active Hotels (the “Purchased
Shares”) to a group of Active Hotels employees for a cash purchase price per
share equal to the purchase price per share paid by the Company to acquire
Active Hotels. The Company also granted restricted stock (the “Granted Shares”)
representing an additional 1.1% equity interest in its Active Hotels subsidiary
to certain employees of Active Hotels. An accrual for deferred compensation
expense related to the granted restricted stock of approximately $2.1 million
was recorded at the time of issuance, and will be amortized over the three year
vesting period. During 2004, the Company recognized approximately $168,000 of
personnel expense related to this amortization.

Travelweb LLC

– In May 2004, Lowestfare.com, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired 71.4% of the equity interest
in Travelweb, a Delaware limited liability company owned by Marriott
International, Inc. (“Marriott”), Hilton Hotels Corporation (“Hilton”), Hyatt
Corporation (“Hyatt”), Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”),
InterContinental Hotels Group (“InterContinental”) and Pegasus Solutions, Inc.
(“Pegusus”), or their affiliates.  Travelweb is a full-service, automated
hotel distribution network founded by Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Starwood, Pegasus
and InterContinental.  The equity interests acquired were all but those
held by InterContinental. The Company acquired the InterContinental interests
in December 2004, bringing the Company’s total interest in Travelweb to
100%.

The aggregate investment in Travelweb to date is
$33.6 million, consisting of $20.8 million paid in cash in May 2004, $4.2
million paid in cash in December 2004, the Company’s initial investment of
$8.6 million made in March 2003, plus all direct acquisition costs. In
addition, the Company will potentially pay an earn-out after 12 months of
approximately 954,547 shares of its common stock to the sellers, other than
InterContinental, in the event certain performance goals are met.

The purchase price for the equity interests in Travelweb
was determined through arms’ length negotiations between management of the
Company on the one hand and Travelweb members on the other hand.  Prior to
the acquisition, Lowestfare.com owned 14.3% of the equity interest in
Travelweb, and Jeffery Boyd, a director of the Company and its Chief Executive
Officer and President, was a member of the board of directors of
Travelweb.  Jeffery Boyd is also a member of the board of directors of
Lowestfare.com and its Chief Executive Officer.  All of Travelweb’s founding
hotel chains also participate in the Company’s

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and
results of operations include the consolidated accounts of Travelweb since May
2004. Prior to the May 2004 acquisition, the Company accounted for its
investment in Travelweb under the equity method of accounting. Under the
purchase method of accounting, the proportion of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from Travelweb are recorded at the date of acquisition at
their respective estimated fair values. The acquisition cost, including
transaction costs, was allocated to the underlying net assets of Travelweb in
proportion to their respective estimated fair values. The Company obtained an
independent valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities


assumed,
including the identification of intangible assets other than goodwill to assist
the Company in its purchase price allocation. The excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired was recorded as
goodwill.

In connection with the acquisition of Travelweb, the
Company expects to incur costs of approximately $2.5 million for severance and
contract terminations related to the acquired business.  The Company has
identified and notified the affected Travelweb personnel and vendors. 
Such exiting costs are expected to be paid out in cash and approximately $1.0
million was paid as of December 31, 2004.

Assets acquired consisted principally of cash and
intangible assets. The aggregate fair value of Travelweb’s assets and
liabilities, at acquisition, were approximately $23.9 million and $20.7
million, respectively, prior to adjustment. Liabilities assumed consisted
principally of accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred merchant
bookings. Total goodwill resulting from the Travelweb acquisition amounted to
approximately $26.9 million. Identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill
amounted to approximately $6.0 million. The Company recorded 85.7% of this
amount in May 2004 and the incremental remaining 14.3% in December 2004.

A list of the estimated fair value and useful lives
of acquired identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

results of operations of the Company to give effect to the acquisition of
Travelweb and Active Hotels as if the acquisitions had occurred as of the
beginning of the periods presented. These statements include certain purchase
related entries and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of
operations that might have occurred, nor are they necessarily indicative of
expected results in the future.

Other Acquisitions

In 2003,
pursuant to asset purchase agreements, the Company purchased the Internet
domain names www.rentalcars.com and www.breezenet.com, and their related
intellectual property. The


acquisitions were part of the
Company’s plan to grow its rental car business. The acquisitions were accounted
for as purchases and, accordingly, the total purchase price of approximately
$5.5 million was allocated to the assets acquired, primarily indefinite lived
intangibles and other intangibles with determinable lives, based on their respective
fair values on the acquisition date. The results of operations of
Rentalcars.com and Breezenet.com are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations from the respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of the
acquisitions on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, assuming the
acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2002, is not material.

RESTRUCTURING,
SPECIAL AND SEVERANCE CHARGES

In the
fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $564,000. This restructuring charge resulted from a re-evaluation
and refinement of the Company’s estimated real estate costs related to leased
property vacated in connection with the 2002 and 2000 restructurings.

In the
fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of
approximately $4.7 million. This restructuring charge resulted from the
repositioning of the Company’s non-travel businesses and a reduction in
headcount. The repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and
focus the Company’s resources on its travel business. The charge related
primarily to severance payments, real estate costs and asset impairments.

The
Company’s work force was reduced by 59 full-time employees at its Norwalk
location and 4 full-time employees at its Europe location. The employee
termination costs primarily represent severance payments and related benefits. The
real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related
to space the Company decided it no longer needed, and which it will not utilize
in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space. Asset
impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects, and
software costs related to the Company’s plans not to pursue certain service
offerings and activities. Other restructuring charges include professional and
other fees and costs incurred in 2002 associated with the restructuring
activities.

The
components and the annual activity related to the restructuring charges for the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004 were as follows (in thousands):


During
2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company decreased the liability for the restructuring
charge by approximately $12,000, $753,000 and $916,000, respectively. These
reductions resulted from the favorable resolution of certain matters, primarily
the collection of certain receivables and the settlement of real estate
commitments, and were reflected as an adjustment to the “Restructuring charge
(reversal)” line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The
Company estimates, based on current available information, the remaining net
cash outflows associated with its restructuring related commitments will be
paid in 2005. These restructuring accruals are recorded in “Accrued expenses”
and “Other long-term liabilities,” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE RESERVES

The
Company accrues for costs associated with purchases made in its websites by
individuals using fraudulent credit cards and for other amounts “charged back”
as a result of payment disputes. Additionally, the Company is liable for the
cost of accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when
it does not act as merchant of record. The Company also records a provision for
uncollectible commissions.


7.

NET
INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

The
Company computes both basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with
SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share.” Basic earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted average
number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year which
is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and assumes
conversion of the Company’s 1% Notes (see Note 12). Common equivalent shares are
excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive
effect. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the
average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on EPS and,
accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.

A
reconciliation of net income and the weighted average number of shares
outstanding used in calculating diluted earnings per share is as follows:

(1)

Since
the Company incurred a loss for 2002, the inclusion of stock options and
warrants in the calculation of weighted average common shares was anti-dilutive
and, therefore, there was no difference between basic and diluted earnings per
share.

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT

Property
and equipment at December 31, 2004 and 2003 consists of the following (in
thousands):


Fixed
asset depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $9.1 million,

annual estimated amortization expense for the amortizable acquired intangible
assets for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):

10.

GOODWILL

A
substantial majority of the Company’s goodwill relates to its acquisitions of
Active Hotels and Travelweb. The Company recorded goodwill amounting to
approximately $96 million in connection with its acquisition of Active Hotels
in September 2004 and $26.9 million in connection with its acquisition of
a controlling interest in Travelweb in May and December 2004.


During
the third quarter of 2002, the Company performed impairment tests and
determined that the carrying amount of goodwill associated with its investment
in priceline.com europe exceeded its implied fair value by approximately $12.2
million and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of $12.2 million. The
fair value was determined using generally accepted valuation techniques
including the market value of comparable companies (including revenue multiple
methodology) and discounted cash flow methods. Underlying the impairment was a
continued decline in the market value of priceline.com’s common stock, which
the Company reviews quarterly as an indicator of possible impairment of
priceline.com europe’s carrying value, a deterioration in priceline.com europe’s
operations caused primarily by increasingly competitive conditions among
European online travel companies, and a decision in 2002 to reconfigure service
offerings.

During
2003, goodwill was reduced by approximately $2.05 million as a result of
changes in estimates related to exit costs recorded as part of priceline.com
Europe Holdings’ acquisition in accordance with EITF 95-3 “Recognition of
Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” Goodwill at December 31,
2004 and 2003 consists of the following (in thousands):

11.

OTHER
ASSETS

Other
assets at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 consist of the
following (in thousands):

Investment
in pricelinemortgage.com represents the Company’s 49% equity investment in
pricelinemortgage.com and, accordingly, the Company has recognized its pro rata
share of pricelinemortgage.com’s operating results, not to exceed an amount
that the Company believes represents the investments’ estimated fair value. The
Company recognized approximately $8,000, $3.1 million and $1.2 million of
income from its investment in pricelinemortgage.com in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company earned advertising fees from pricelinemortgage.com of
approximately $100,000, $534,000 and $1.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The excess of the carrying value of the Company’s equity
investment in pricelinemortgage.com over its equity in the underlying net
assets was approximately $1.1 million as of December 31, 2004.

In March 2003,
Lowestfare.com, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, invested
approximately $8.6 million (including fees relating to the transaction) in
Travelweb. Lowestfare.com’s investment represented approximately 14% of the
outstanding equity of Travelweb. The investment was accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. The Company recognized approximately $574,000


and $734,000 of net loss from its
equity investment in Travelweb in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company
earned travel commissions from Travelweb of approximately $108,000 and $164,000
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In May 2004,
the Company acquired a controlling interest in Travelweb.

Deferred
debt issuance costs arose from the Company’s issuance of $125 million aggregate
principal amount of 1% Notes in August 2003 and $100 million aggregate
principal amount of 2.25% Notes in June 2004. Deferred debt issuance costs
of approximately $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively, consisting
primarily of underwriting commissions and professional service fees, are being
amortized using the effective interest rate method over approximately five
years.

During
the third quarter of 2002 the Company performed a periodic evaluation of the
progress of the operations of Hutchison-Priceline Limited. Factors including
increasing negative variances in key operating metrics such as negative gross
margins and continuing operating losses, negative net asset position and an
increasingly competitive operating environment led the Company to determine
that the carrying value of its convertible note no longer reflected its fair
value. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$12.2 million. Estimated fair value was determined using cash flow estimates
and a review of the market value of comparable companies including the
consideration of the decline in the Company’s market value and through
discussion with third party valuation specialists.

12.

CONVERTIBLE
DEBT

In August 2003,
the Company issued, in a private placement, $125 million aggregate principal
amount of Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2010, with an interest
rate of 1%. The 1% Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into
priceline.com’s common stock, par value $0.008 per share, at the option of the
holder, at a conversion price of approximately $40.00 per share, subject to
adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Each $1,000 principal
amount of 1% Notes will initially be convertible into 25 shares of the Company’s
common stock if, on or prior to August 1, 2008, the closing price of the
Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive
trading days ending on the first day of a conversion period is more than 110%
of the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes, or after August 1,
2008, if the closing price of the Company’s common stock is more than 110% of
the then current conversion price of the 1% Notes. The 1% Notes are also
convertible in certain other circumstances, such as a change in control of the
Company. In addition, the 1% Notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option
beginning in 2008, and the holders may require the Company to repurchase the 1%
Notes on August 1, 2008 or in certain other circumstances. Interest on the
1% Notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

In November 2003,
the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby it swapped the
fixed 1% interest on its 1% Notes for a floating interest rate based on the
3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR, minus the applicable margin of approximately 221
basis points, on $45 million notional value of debt. This agreement expires August 1,
2010. The Company designated this interest rate swap agreement as a fair value
hedge. The changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and
the underlying debt are recorded as offsetting gains and losses in interest
income and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Hedge ineffectiveness
of $2,000 was recorded as interest income for the year ended December 31,
2004. Hedge ineffectiveness of $61,000 was recorded as a reduction of interest
income for the year ended December 31, 2003. The fair value (cost if
terminated) of this swap as of December 31, 2004 was approximately
$692,000 and has been recorded in other long-term liabilities and as an
adjustment to the carrying value of debt.

In June 2004,
the Company issued, in a private placement, $100 million aggregate principal
amount of Convertible Senior Notes due January 15, 2025, with an interest
rate of 2.25%. The 2.25% Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions,
into priceline.com’s common stock, par value $0.008 per share, at the option of
the holder, at a conversion price of approximately $37.95 per share, subject to


adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events. Each $1,000 principal amount of 2.25% Notes will initially be
convertible into 26.3505 shares of the Company’s common stock if, on or prior
to January 15, 2025, certain conditions occur. The 2.25% Notes are also
convertible in certain other circumstances, such as a change in control of the
Company. In the event that all or substantially all of the Company’s common
stock is acquired prior to January 15, 2010, in a transaction in which the
consideration paid to holders of the Company’s common stock consists of all or
substantially all cash, the Company would be required to make additional
payments to the holders of the 2.25% Notes of amounts ranging from $0 to $19.1
million depending upon the date of the transaction and the then current stock
price of the Company. The Company’s obligation to make this payment is treated
as an embedded derivative which, pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
(“SFAS 133”), must be assigned its own value separate and apart from the value
of the 2.25% Notes. The estimated value of the derivative has been established
based upon several quantitative and qualitative factors and will be amortized
as interest expense ratably over approximately a 5 ½ year period. Pursuant to
SFAS 133, any subsequent changes in the value of the derivative will be recognized
as income or expense in the period in which the change in value occurs. In
addition, the 2.25% Notes will be redeemable at the Company’s option beginning January 20,
2010, and the holders may require the Company to repurchase the 2.25% Notes on January 15,
2010, 2015 and 2020, or in certain other circumstances. Interest on the 2.25%
Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year.

During
2004, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the
1% Notes and the 2.25% Notes in the acquisitions of Travelweb and Active
Hotels. The remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes,
strategic uses and working capital requirements.

13.

TREASURY
STOCK

On July 31,
2002, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $40
million of the Company’s common stock from time to time in the open market or
in privately negotiated transactions. As part of the stock repurchase program,
the Company purchased 897,953 shares of its common stock for its treasury during
the period ended December 31, 2002 at an aggregate cost of approximately
$11.8 million and purchased an additional 690,000 shares of its common stock
for its treasury during the year ended December 31, 2003 at an aggregate
cost of approximately $12.2 million. All shares were purchased at prevailing
market prices. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock
during the year ended December 31, 2004.

The
Company may continue or, from time to time, commence or suspend repurchases of
shares under its stock repurchase program, depending on prevailing market
conditions, alternate uses of capital and other factors. Whether and when to
initiate and/or complete any purchase of common stock and the amount of common
stock purchased will be determined in the Company’s complete discretion. As of December 31,
2004, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock
held in treasury.

14.

STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY

In June 2003,
the Company’s shareholders approved a one-for-six reverse stock split of its
outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split was effected on June 16,
2003, and, as a result, the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock was
reduced from approximately 227.6 million to approximately 37.9 million shares.
The par value of the common stock was not affected by the reverse stock split
and remains at $0.008 per share.

In 2003,
the Company issued an aggregate of 83,333 shares of restricted common stock to
its Chief Executive Officer, and its Chief Financial Officer. The restricted
stock has a four-year vesting period. The accrual for deferred compensation
expense related to the shares issued was recorded at the market value on the
date of the grant and the related compensation expense is being amortized over
the vesting period.


During
2004, the Company issued an aggregate of 12,000 shares of restricted common
stock to its Board of Directors. The restricted stock has a four-year vesting
period. The accrual for deferred compensation expense related to the shares
issued was recorded at the market value on the date of the grant and the
related compensation expense is being amortized over the vesting period.

During
2004 and 2003, the Company recorded stock based compensation expense
amortization of $470,000 and $282,000, respectively, related to those
issuances.

15.

REDEEMABLE
PREFERRED STOCK

In February 2001,
the Board of Directors authorized an amendment to the Company’s certificate of
incorporation to allow the Company to issue a new series of preferred stock
designated as Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”).
The total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that the Company is
authorized to issue is 80,000 shares, par value $.01 per share.

The
Series B Preferred Stock has special preferences. Specifically, the Series B
Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus an amount
equal to any dividends accrued or accumulated but not paid and is subject to
mandatory redemption on February 6, 2007. The Series B Preferred Stock
accrues dividends payable in shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate of
11% per annum commencing February 6, 2001. Dividends on the Series B
Preferred Stock are payable semiannually on February 6 and August 6
of each year starting August 6, 2001.

The
Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the option of the Company or the
holder, in whole or in part, at any time upon a change of control of the
Company at $1,000 per share in cash, plus accrued but unpaid dividends and
dividends that would have accrued through February 6, 2007. Other than as
described below, the Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of
the Company’s common stock or any other security of the Company. Holders of the
Series B Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote on any matter, except in
certain limited circumstances and as specifically required under Delaware
General Corporate Law. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to
specified cash payments in the event of certain business combination
transactions involving the Company.

During
the first quarter of 2001, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) received 80,000
shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and warrants (the “Warrants”) to
purchase approximately 4.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an
exercise price of $17.81 per share. The exercise price of the Warrants is paid
by surrendering .0178125 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for each share of
the Company’s common stock purchased.

Pursuant
to the terms of the certificate of designations relating to the Series B
Preferred Stock, the dividend that is payable through the issuance of shares of
the Company’s common stock each year is subject to adjustment as provided for
in the certificate of designations (and as described below as the result of
exercise of the Warrants). In the event the Company consummates any of certain
business combination transactions, the Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed
at the option of the Company or Delta at the $1,000 liquidation preference per
outstanding share plus all dividends accrued but not paid on the shares. In
such an event, Delta would be entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of
the dividend payments that would have accrued or accumulated on the shares to
be redeemed through the remaining scheduled dividend payment dates.

During
2001, Delta exercised Warrants to purchase approximately 3.1 million shares of
the Company’s common stock and on January 29, 2002, Delta exercised
Warrants to purchase 666,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result,
there are 13,470 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding with an
aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $13.5 million and the Company’s
future semi-annual dividend requirement is 40,240 shares of common stock. In
accordance with the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company
delivered to Delta the required shares of the Company’s


common stock as dividend payments.
The Company recorded non-cash dividends of approximately $1.5 million, $1.5
million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

The
Warrants provide that at any time the closing sales price of the Company’s common
stock has exceeded $53.44 (subject to adjustment) for 20 consecutive trading
days, the Warrants will automatically be exercised. As of December 31,
2004, there were 756,199 Warrants outstanding.

16.

OTHER
WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK

During July 1999,
priceline.com issued to Continental Airlines a warrant to purchase common stock
that became exercisable in July 2004. The warrant grants Continental the
right to purchase a total of 166,666 shares of priceline.com common stock at an
exercise price of $359.58.

In November 1999,
the Company entered into separate Participation Warrant Agreements with certain
domestic airlines relating to their inclusion in the Company’s leisure airline
ticket service. Under the Participation Warrant Agreements, the airlines were
granted warrants to purchase a total of approximately 3.3 million shares of
priceline.com common stock at exercise prices ranging from $339.75 to $359.58
per share. All warrants were fully vested on the date of grant, and are
generally exercisable until their expiration in May 2005.

Delta Air
Lines also holds warrants to purchase 779,166 shares of the Company’s common
stock at an exercise price of $28.31 per share. These warrants became
exercisable in November 2004.

In March 2003,
in connection with the renewal of a marketing agreement with Marriott
International, Inc., (“Marriott”) the Company issued Marriott 833,333 warrants
to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $9.84
per share. The warrants, which are not transferable, are fully vested,
non-forfeitable, and will be exercisable no earlier than three years from the
date of issuance (subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a
reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation involving priceline.com).
In connection with the issuance of the warrants, the Company recorded a charge
of approximately $6.6 million in 2003 determined by using an option pricing
model.

STOCK
OPTION PLANS

Priceline.com
has adopted the following stock option plans from which broad-based employee
grants may be made: 1997 Omnibus Plan (the “1997 Plan”), the 1999 Omnibus Plan
(the “1999 Plan”) and the 2000 Employee Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan,” and
together with the 1997 Plan and the 1999 Plan, the “Stock Option Plans”), each
of which provides for grants of options as incentives and rewards to encourage
employees, officers, consultants and directors in the long-term success of the
Company. At a Special Meeting of the stockholders of the Company on January 24,
2005, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1999 Plan to increase the
number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance
under the 1999 Plan by two million shares.  The 1997 Plan, 1999 Plan and
2000 Plan provide for grants of options to purchase up to 3,979,166, 7,895,833
and 1,000,000 shares of priceline.com common stock, respectively, at a purchase
price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.


The following summarizes the
transactions pursuant to the Stock Option Plans:

TAXES

Domestic
pre-tax income was $38.9 million and $14.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Domestic pre-tax loss was $9.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. Foreign pre-tax loss was $7.6 million, $2.2
million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

The tax
provision (benefit) at December 31, 2004 is as follows:

The tax
effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as
follows (in thousands):


The net
deferred tax liability of $25.7 million at December 31, 2004 relates to
basis differences arising in connection with the assignment of part of the
purchase price of Active Hotels to intangible assets.

A
valuation allowance of $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion was recorded at December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, and represents the portion of
the tax operating loss carryforwards and the other future deductible items for
which it is not more likely than not that the benefit of such items will be
realized. The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 and increased by approximately $19 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in 2003 reflects
additional U.K. operating loss carryforwards recorded, and a corresponding
valuation allowance, relating to priceline.com europe Ltd. The Company
experienced increased profitability in 2004 versus prior years. If this trend
continues, the Company’s judgment as to the recoverability of all or a portion
of its net deferred tax assets may change and, accordingly, the Company will
need to reassess the appropriateness of carrying a full valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets.

At December 31,
2004 the Company had approximately $3.0 billion of net operating loss
carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from December 31, 2019 to December 31,
2021 which are subject to limitation on future utilization under Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 382 imposes limitations on
the availability of a company’s net operating losses after a more than 50
percentage point ownership change occurs. As a result of a study (the “NOL Study”),
it was determined that ownership changes, as defined in Section 382,
occurred in 2000 and 2002. The amount of the Company’s net operating losses
incurred prior to each ownership change is limited (the “Loss Limitation”)
based on the value of the Company on the respective dates of ownership change. It
is estimated that the effect of Section 382 will generally limit the
amount of net operating loss which is available to offset future taxable income
to approximately $69 million annually. The estimate of the annual Loss
Limitation is based upon certain conclusions in the NOL Study pertaining to the
dates of the ownership changes and the value of the Company on the dates of the
ownership changes. The overall determination of the Loss Limitation and conclusions
contained in the NOL Study are subject to interpretation, and therefore, the
annual Loss Limitation could be subject to change.

At December 31,
2004, the Company had approximately $197 million of U.S. capital loss
carryforwards, which expire from December 31, 2005 to December 31,
2007. At December 31, 2004, the Company also had approximately $1.4
million of U.S. research credit carryforwards. Such credit carryforwards expire
from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. These U.S. capital loss
and U.S. research credit carryforwards are also subject to annual limitation.


Approximately
$769 million of the Company’s tax net operating losses at December 31,
2004 relate to the exercise of stock options which have been granted under the
Company’s various stock option plans and gives rise to compensation which has
been included in the taxable income of the applicable current and former
employees and deducted by the Company for federal and state income tax purposes.
Additionally, approximately $1.06 billion of the Company’s tax net operating
losses relate to the excess of tax deductions from the exercise of certain
stock warrants granted by the Company in excess of the associated warrant costs
recorded for financial accounting purposes. Finally, the Company recorded $6.8
million of costs for financial reporting purposes in excess of the amount
deductible for tax purposes relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

Acquisition of Active Hotels.

In
connection with the Company’s acquisition of Active Hotels, the Company sold a
2.3% equity interest in Active Hotels to a group of Active Hotels employees for
a cash purchase price per share equal to the purchase price per share paid by
the Company to acquire Active Hotels.

The
Company also granted restricted stock representing an additional 1.1% equity

connection with the Company’s acquisition of Travelweb, the Company agreed to
pay additional contingent purchase price consideration to the sellers of
Travelweb (other than InterContinental Hotels Group) in the event that certain
performance targets are met during the 12-month period following the
acquisition date of Travelweb. The additional contingent consideration consists
of 954,547 shares of common stock which had a market value of approximately
$22.5 million as of December 31, 2004.

Litigation.

On December 30,
2004, the City of Los Angeles filed a putative class action complaint in
Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, on behalf of itself and other
allegedly similarly situated cities in California, naming as defendants: Hotels.com,
L.P.; Hotels.Com GP., LLC; Hotwire, Inc.; Cheaptickets, Inc.; Cendant Travel
Distribution Services Group, Inc.; Expedia, Inc.; Internetwork Publishing Corp.
(d/b/a Lodging.com); Lowestfare.com, Inc.; Maupintour Holding LLC; Orbitz,
Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; priceline.com, Inc.; Site59.com, LLC; Travelocity.com, Inc.;
Travelocity.com LP; Travelweb, LLC; Travelnow.com, Inc. (

City of Los Angeles
v. Hotels.com, Inc. et al

.) The complaint alleges, among other things, that
each of these defendants violated the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance
of the City of Los Angeles, and allegedly similar ordinances of other California
cities, with respect to the charging and remittance of amounts to cover taxes
under such ordinances, and that such violations also constitute acts of unfair
competition under California Business and Professions Code Section 17200
et seq. (“Section 17200”). The complaint seeks payment of alleged unpaid
taxes owed, relief from conversion, including punitive damages, and imposition
of a constructive trust. As of March 1, 2005, the Company nor its wholly
owned subsidiaries, Lowestfare.com and Travelweb had been served with the
complaint.

On February 17,
2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the same court by Ronald
Bush and three other individuals on behalf of themselves and other allegedly
similarly situated California consumers against several of the same defendants
as named in the City of Los Angeles action, including the Company (

Bush et
al. v. Cheaptickets, Inc. et al

.) The complaint alleges each of the
defendants engaged in acts of unfair competition in violation of Section 17200
relating to their respective disclosures and charging customers to cover taxes
under the above ordinances of City of Los Angeles and other California cities,
and service fees. The complaint seeks restitution under Section 17200,
relief for alleged conversion, including punitive damages, injunctive relief,
and imposition of a constructive trust. The Company was served with the
complaint on or about February 25, 2005. It is anticipated that the court
will extend the time in which to respond to the complaint pending a
determination of whether the case should be designated as a “complex” case
and/or transferred to a different division of the court.

Also on February 17,
2005, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of
Delaware for New Castle County by Jeanne Marshall and three other individuals
on behalf of themselves


and a putative class of allegedly
similarly situated consumers nationwide against the Company. The complaint
alleges that the Company violated the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, Del. Code
Ann. Tit. 6, § 2523 relating to its disclosures and charging customers to
cover taxes under city hotel occupancy tax ordinances nationwide, and service
fees. The complaint seeks damages, including punitive damages, injunctive
relief, and imposition of a constructive trust. The Company was served with the
complaint on March 2, 1005. An answer or motion responsive to the
complaint currently is due on or before March 22, 2005.

The
Company intends to defend vigorously against these actions. The Company is
unable at this time to predict the outcome of these suits or reasonably
estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On March 16,
March 26, April 27, and June 5, 2001, respectively, four
putative class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York naming priceline.com, Inc., Richard S. Braddock,
Jay Walker, Paul Francis, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., BancBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. as defendants (01 Civ. 2261, 01 Civ. 2576, 01 Civ.
3590 and 01 Civ. 4956). Shives

et al

.
v. Bank of America Securities LLC

et al

.,
01 Civ. 4956, also names other defendants and states claims unrelated to the
Company. The complaints allege, among other things, that priceline.com and the
individual defendants violated the federal securities laws by issuing and
selling priceline.com common stock in priceline.com’s March 1999 initial
public offering without disclosing to investors that some of the underwriters
in the offering, including the lead underwriters, had allegedly solicited and
received excessive and undisclosed commissions from certain investors. By
Orders of Judge Mukasey and Judge Scheindlin dated August 8, 2001, these
cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes with hundreds of other cases,
which contain allegations concerning the allocation of shares in the initial
public offerings of companies other than priceline.com, Inc. By Order of Judge
Scheindlin dated August 14, 2001, the following cases were consolidated
for all purposes: 01 Civ. 2261; 01 Civ. 2576; and 01 Civ. 3590. On April 19,
2002, plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in these
cases. This Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint makes similar
allegations to those described above but with respect to both the Company’s March 1999
initial public offering and the Company’s August 1999 second public
offering of common stock. The named defendants are priceline.com, Inc., Richard
S. Braddock, Jay S. Walker, Paul E. Francis, Nancy B. Peretsman, Timothy G.
Brier, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs & Co., Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., Robertson Stephens, Inc. (as successor-in-interest
to BancBoston), Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. (as successor-in-interest to
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.), Allen & Co., Inc. and
Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. Priceline, Richard Braddock, Jay Walker, Paul
Francis, Nancy Peretsman, and Timothy Brier, together with other issuer
defendants in the consolidated litigation, filed a joint motion to dismiss on July 15,
2002. On November 18, 2002, the cases against the individual defendants
were dismissed without prejudice and without costs. In addition, counsel for
plaintiffs and the individual defendants executed Reservation of Rights and
Tolling Agreements, which toll the statutes of limitations on plaintiffs’
claims against those individuals. On February 19, 2003, Judge Scheindlin
issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part the issuer’s
motion. None of the claims against the Company were dismissed. On June 26,
2003, counsel for the plaintiff class announced that they and counsel for the
issuers had agreed to the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Memorandum”)
to settle claims against the issuers. The terms of that Memorandum provide that
class members will be guaranteed $1 billion dollars in recoveries by the
insurers of the issuers and that settling issuer defendants will assign to the
class members certain claims that they may have against the underwriters. Issuers
also agree to limit their abilities to bring certain claims against the
underwriters. If recoveries in excess of $1 billion dollars are obtained by the
class from any non-settling defendants, the settling defendants’ monetary
obligations to the class plaintiffs will be satisfied; any amount recovered
from the underwriters that is less than $1 billion will be paid by the insurers
on behalf of the issuers. The Memorandum, which is subject to the approval of
each issuer, was approved by a special committee of the priceline.com Board of
Directors on Thursday, July 3, 2003. Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff
class and counsel for the issuers agreed to the form of a Stipulation and
Agreement of Settlement with Defendant Issuers and Individuals (“Settlement
Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement implements the MOU and contains the same
material


provisions. On June 11, 2004,
a special committee of the priceline.com Board of Directors authorized the
Company’s counsel to execute the Settlement Agreement on behalf of the Company.
The Settlement Agreement is subject to final approval by the Court and the
process to obtain that approval is still pending.

Subsequent
to the Company’s announcement on September 27, 2000 that revenues for the
third quarter 2000 would not meet expectations, it was served with the
following putative class action complaints:


All of
these cases have been assigned to Judge Dominick J. Squatrito. On September 12,
2001, Judge Squatrito ordered that these cases be consolidated under the Master
File No. 3:00cv1884 (DJS), and he designated lead plaintiffs and lead
plaintiffs’ counsel. On October 29, 2001, plaintiffs served a Consolidated
Amended Complaint. On February 5, 2002, Amerindo Investment Advisors,
Inc., who was one of the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated action, made a
motion for leave to withdraw as lead plaintiff. The Court granted that motion
on May 30, 2002. On February 28, 2002, the Company filed a motion to
dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint. On October 7, 2004, the Court
issued a Memorandum of Decision granting, in part, and denying, in part, the
Company’s motion. A scheduling order was entered by the Court on November 2,
2004 and the parties are now proceeding with discovery. Plaintiffs filed a
motion for class certification on January 7, 2005, to which the Company’s
opposition is due on April 8, 2005. The Company intends to defend
vigorously against this action. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of
these suits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

In
addition, on November 1, 2000 the Company was served with a complaint that
purported to be a shareholder derivative action against its Board of Directors
and certain of its current and former executive officers, as well as the
Company (as a nominal defendant). The complaint alleged breach of fiduciary
duty and waste of corporate assets. The action is captioned Mark Zimmerman v.
Richard Braddock, J. Walker, D. Schulman, P. Allaire, R. Bahna, P. Blackney, W.
Ford, M. Loeb, N. Nicholas, N. Peretsman, and priceline.com Incorporated,
18473-NC (Court of Chancery of Delaware, County of New Castle, State of
Delaware). On February 6, 2001, all defendants moved to dismiss the
complaint for failure to make a demand upon the Board of Directors and failure
to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. Pursuant to a
stipulation by the parties, an amended complaint was filed on June 21,
2001. Defendants renewed their motion to dismiss on August 20, 2001, and
plaintiff served his opposition to that motion on October 26, 2001. Defendants
filed their reply brief on January 7, 2002. On December 20, 2002, the
Court granted defendants’ motion without prejudice. On April 25, 2003, a
second amended complaint, adding H. Miller, was filed and a motion seeking
leave of court to file the second amended complaint was filed on July 28,
2003. That motion has been fully briefed. The Court has yet to rule on the
motion; oral argument is presently being scheduled. The Company intends to
defend vigorously against this action. The Company is unable to predict the
outcome of the suit or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On November 7,
2003, the Company was served with a complaint that purported to be a
shareholder derivative action against its Board of Directors and certain of its
current and former executive


officers, as well as the Company
(as a nominal defendant). The complaint alleged, among other things, breach of
fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and misappropriation of corporate
information. The claims in the complaint appear to be substantially repetitive
of the claims pending in the derivative action in Delaware which is described
below. The action is captioned Don Powell v. Richard S. Braddock, Jay S.
Walker, Daniel H. Schulman, Paul A. Allaire, Ralph M. Bahna, Paul J. Blackney,
William E. Ford, Marshall Loeb, N. J. Nicholas, Jr., Nancy B. Peretsman, and
Heidi G. Miller and priceline.com Incorporated (Superior Court, Judicial
District of Stamford/Norwalk, State of Connecticut). On January 28, 2004,
defendants Blackney, Nicholas, Peretsman and Loeb moved to dismiss the
complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On January 29, 2004,
defendant Miller moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal
jurisdiction and for insufficient service of process. On February 27,
2004, defendants Braddock, Walker, Schulman, Allaire, Bahna, Blackney, Loeb,
Nicholas, Peretsman, Miller and priceline.com moved to dismiss the complaint
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and defendants Braddock and Schulman
also moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and
insufficient service of process. At a hearing on May 3, 2004, the Court stated
that it would not rule on the pending motions until the pending motions in the
Delaware action described above are decided. The Court conducted a subsequent
status conference on January 10, 2005, at which it requested that the
parties report back no later than March 15, 2005 on the status of the
Delaware derivative suit. The Company intends to defend vigorously against this
action. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this suit or reasonably
estimate a range of possible loss, if any.

On January 6,
1999, the Company received notice that a third party patent applicant and
patent attorney, Thomas G. Woolston, purportedly had filed in December 1998
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office a request to declare an
interference between a patent application filed by Woolston and the Company’s
U.S. Patent 5,794,207. The Company is currently awaiting information from the
Patent Office regarding whether it will initiate an interference proceeding.

From time
to time, the Company has been and expects to continue to be subject to legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of
alleged infringement of third party intellectual property rights by it. Such
claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources, divert management’s attention from our
business objectives and could adversely affect the Company’s business, results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Uncertainty regarding payment of sales and hotel occupancy
and other related taxes.

On an
ongoing basis, the Company conducts reviews and interpretations of the tax laws
in various states and other jurisdictions relating to the payment of state and
local hotel occupancy and other related taxes. In connection with its reviews,
the Company has met and had discussions with taxing authorities in certain
jurisdictions but the ultimate resolution in any particular jurisdiction cannot
be determined at this time. Currently, hotels collect and remit hotel occupancy
and related taxes to the various tax authorities based on the amounts collected
by the hotels. Consistent with this practice, the Company recovers the taxes on
the underlying cost of the hotel room night from customers and remits the taxes
to the hotel operators for payment to the appropriate tax authorities.

Several
jurisdictions have indicated that they may take the position that sales or
hotel occupancy tax is applicable to the differential between the price paid by
a customer for the Company’s service and the cost to the Company of the
underlying room. Historically, the Company has not collected taxes on this
differential. Some state and local jurisdictions could assert that the Company
is subject to hotel occupancy taxes on this differential and could seek to
collect such taxes, either retroactively or prospectively or both. Such actions
may result in substantial liabilities for past sales and could have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.

To the
extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that such a tax collection
responsibility exists, it is likely that, with respect to future transactions,
the Company would collect any such additional


tax obligation from its customers,
which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room nights to the
Company’s customers and, consequently, could reduce its hotel sales. The
Company will continue to assess the risks of the potential financial impact of
additional tax exposure, and to the extent appropriate, it will reserve for
those estimates of liabilities.

Worldspan, L.P. Agreement

In October 2001,
the Company entered into a long-term worldwide technology agreement with
Worldspan, L.P., pursuant to which Worldspan, L.P. acts as the Company’s
preferred global distribution system and provides the Company with product
development resources. The current agreement, as amended, expires on December 31,
2007, and requires the Company to use Worldspan, L.P. for a significant
majority of its travel bookings originated in the United States. In return, the
Company earns a fee for such bookings.

Employment Contracts

The
Company has employment agreements with certain members of senior management
that provide for minimum annual compensation of approximately $3.4 million in
the aggregate. Generally, the agreements provide for aggregated severance
payments of up to approximately $5.7 million, accelerated vesting of stock
options upon, among other things, death or a termination other than for “cause”
or “good reason”, as those terms are defined in the agreements, and a gross-up
for the payment of golden parachute excise taxes. In addition, the agreements
provide for the extension of health and insurance benefits after termination
for periods of up to three years.

Operating Leases

The
Company leases certain facilities and equipment through operating leases.
Rental expense for operating leases was approximately $2.3 million, $2.2
million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The Company’s executive, administrative, operating offices
and network operations center are located in approximately 92,000 square feet
of leased office space located in Norwalk, Connecticut. Minimum payments for
operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of
one year are as follows (in thousands):
